So a few years ago now, there was a guy who (to summarise) was giving detailed information about how he was causing serious harm to someone. It alarmed me so much that I contacted numerous law enforcement agencies in the US, desperately trying to find someone who had the power to look up this guy's information, track him down, and at least confirm or deny what he was saying. 

I tried 4 different agencies, ranging from federal to the city-state he was in, and all of them said that without my knowing the guy's physical whereabouts, they legally couldn't do anything. And that sucked.

So my question is, if we *do* see highly questionable content that should be reported (I'm not talking about drugs or silly things like that, I'm talking about when people make serious, serious threats), who on earth do we turn to? What agencies actually have the legal right to ask Reddit to hand over personal information?

Normally, of course, I'm all for protecting people's privacy as much as possible. Reddit it obviously meant to be a private community protected as much as possible from invasive monitoring.

Not trying to disparage you, because I found all of this intensely interesting. I am just genuinely curious at what this is aimed to accomplish. 

Is this for users who are potentially using reddit while living in oppressive regimes where access to information is heavily censored? Is it to protect the user from legal consequences if they participate in acts that are considered illegal? Is it just a broad counter-measure to increased data-collection capabilities of western liberal democracies, in case shit eventually hits the fan? Is this aimed more toward someone in a state like China or Russia that has a very real existential threat to their safety if they participate in discourse against the government, or does this apply equally to democracies like the US, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, or the UK?

It's timeconsuming to get numbers leading to a meaningful presentation, so most mod teams choose not to show poor data that confuses more than it helps to their users.

---

For similar reasons, I'd advocate for reddit removing the /about/traffic pages as they're so grossly misleading without mobile traffic they're worse than no data. That's again the same reasoning behind the sound decision to remove the grossly inaccurate upvote/downvote counts from the comment data API.

If we could easily break down removals automatically (say an interface showing what automod rule removes something) we could also provide meaningful data on what's being removed rather than a report that simply says ""x items were removed."" and leaving users to guess what that means, and fill in the analysis simply based on their preconceived ideas on the topic.

---

I'm not surprised Spez is a fan of this sort of no-context presentation because reddit seems to systematically avoid providing context for numbers they present.

That's a big part of their media strategy because then you just have to trust their interpretation and repeat the angles they push because that's all the data you've got to work with.

Why is okay to push one agenda, but not the other? Yes, Reddit can do what they like, sure - but hey, being professional doesn't help. Why are Reddits admins and moderators not impartial? Just go on any default sub, check the mods, and check the other subreddits they also mod. You'll notice a pattern. Don't take my word for it, do it. 

Default subs that by and large have nothing at all to do with politics, regularly hit the front page with Anti Trump rhetoric. Someone hung a banner out that 3 people saw? Front page.

>Did we mention that the doll is black and Sophia is white? (go on...)
The issue came up right away, when a store cashier asked Sophia: Wouldn't she rather have a doll that looked like her? (of course she did)
**According to her mother**, Sophia had a ready answer.
""She does (look like me)!"" the toddler responded. ""She's a doctor; I'm a doctor. She is a pretty girl; I am a pretty girl. See her pretty hair? See her stethoscope?"" (REALLY? she said that, did she?)

Yeah, that happened. This is news. Not a joke, this is a genuine story someone actually wrote, and there was actually a process involved of ''should we put this up?''. How can anyone trust the integrity of these places, when this fiction is actually...promoted as news.

Police would then try to get as much information about John as possible. Let's say Jane knows where he lives, so the police go out to his house but he's not home. The next step would be to look around the area. maybe there's some woods near the house or something.

It wasn't just one misquote, how did you draw that conclusion? Do you just believe in everything the MSM pushes out?

2. /u/spez abused his powers and changed multiple comments, something that should have gotten him fired but since it's against Trump supporters it's ok. Due to the vilification of the left somehow convincing themselves and others that pro-Trump people don't have the same rights and are some type of subhuman in their eyes. 

3. It's not a Muslim ban, stop saying it's a Muslim ban because 90% of Muslims we're not effected from travel. Indonesia is home to one of the largest Muslim populations but they weren't on the list. The countries that we're listed were done so because of harboring potential terrorist by the Obama administration. So you can blame the previous President for that one, Trump just enacted a temporary ban of travel for these areas to work out a better vetting procedure.

""The outcomes of radicalization are shaped by the ideas of the society at large; for example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society or from a broad desire for change in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into violent extremism (RVE).[2] [3] There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing.[4][5]""

When someone says ""radical"" they can simply be talking about pushing to more extreme ideas. If you dont think t_d pushes to a more extreme right wing agenda then I dont really know what to say. Not all radical ideas are bad. But they are radical relative to society. Please people, avoid knee-jerk reactions. 

I shouldnt have used alt-right because i knew that people wouldnt take the time to actually think about words and context... Can we please get back on topic now? 

Should reddit try to stop radicalization? I think it is a slippery slope and i believe the real radicalization begins long before someone is thrown off a roof or beheaded.

If it helps, I also believe there are radicalized liberal agendas at play as well and they would be radicalized using the same core function thqt applies to the radicalization of violent islamic extremists. That is to say, fear of an unknown boogeyman who is attempting to stifle and censor their beliefs. I apologize if anyone was offended by my wording but I do think that how people are radicalized is an important thing to think about.

For pulling down those posts, I know there's a large dataset of public reddit comments available on google big query: I'm not sure, but I think there's another dataset of submissions as well, so you could just pull from there en mass instead of scraping reddit directly.

I got a call at 5am, my friend and also ex-GF called me from a bridge 100 miles away to say thanks and goodbye. I kept her on the line and called police when the line broke. She told me I betrayed her trust. In the two months afterwards when we still spoke, she would occasionally talk about her medication and how it was affecting her negatively. She didn't do so in a way that seemed spiteful, only as a matter of pointing out how she felt like anyone else would say ""Ugh I'm so tired"".

I was so unsure of whether she would have actually jumped off the bridge, whether I had trapped her in a bleak and painful world of medication and side effects, whether she could ever really be happy again. Whether or not I should have let her jump, since I couldn't even hope to scratch the surface of understanding what she must have felt. I wrestled with the guilt that maybe I had condemned her to more torture than she deserved to endure. People, friends, would tell me I was a hero and I did a great and brave thing, but I couldn't whole-heartedly believe them.

She stopped talking to me two months afterwards, and I haven't heard from her since. I bumped into her dad once, and found out she went to college. But to this day I don't know if she's doing well.

It took three years before I could really accept that I'd done the best I could, with the best of intentions, and that there's​ nothing I could truly blame myself for. Though I still wish that I'd known earlier how to suggest that she seek help.

I hope that with continuing advancements in the field, your friend might be able to receive more appropriate treatment. And I hope his life turns around, because you made a strong decision from a place of caring. I know how hard it is to make a decision like that, and I hope that such a genuinely good-hearted action has a positive result, no matter how long it takes.

It's harder than most people can imagine to make that call, and the uncertainty and guilt that follows is totally unfair, but sticks with you for a very long time.

>Islamic terrorism is the overwhelming majority of terrorism

The majority of terrorist attacks in the world today involve people who say they follow different versions of Islam. In battle torn regions, terrorism seems like the only option for some groups and whether all attackers involved do it willingly is up for debate. Occasionally, in Western countries, some lone wolf nut decides to jump off the deep end without having much/if any contact with daesh. They then lay claim to said attack because that's what they want. A stated goal is to drive a wedge between normal law abiding Muslims and those who aren't Muslim. To sow distrust, suspicion and fear. You can help daesh with that, if you'd like.

As an outsider, it appears Trump supporters like democracy if it works for them because they didn't even win the popular vote. When people question them, which is what you do in democracies, they tend to get uncomfortable.

As for the UK and Brexit; I'm of the view that the leave people are the ones out of touch. They want the past whilst we are heading to the future. We'll have to see how it goes. Hopefully it won't be as bad as some people think, but I highly doubt it'll be better than if we stayed. If it does go to shit though, I'm with Farage. Emigration calls.

If you call our 911 center from a landline, we automatically get the address and phone number. However, most of our calls our from cell phones. A cell phone will always provide what's called Phase 1. That tells us the tower that it hit off of and a general direction. Might be something like ""TOWER: 123 MAIN STREET NW SECTOR"". Phase 1 data isn't very useful, but can give us a very broad idea of where you might be. Let's say I hear what sounds like racecars driving, and let's say we have 2 racetracks in the county (we don't). I may be able to figure out which one you're at based off what tower your call came from.

If your phone has GPS and it has a location fix, it passes that on to us. That's called Phase 2, and not every 911 center supports it. Even if you have GPS disabled, it overrides and turns itself on if you call 911.

Neither of those above things require an emergency disclosure. If your phone calls 911, it's assumed you have an emergency and that information pops up automatically, usually within a few seconds.

The problem is if we need to track a phone that *hasn't* called 911. That's when we'd most likely call the phone company. Your phone is constantly ""pinging"" towers that are nearby to see which one to use. Most towers have directional antennas. Towers actually have a long range, about 20-40 miles. If you're in range of at least 3 towers, the phone company can triangulate your location from using signal strength data. Imagine that each tower has an invisible circle around it. Where all those circles overlap is where your phone is. The more towers you're in range of, the more accurate a ping will be. Your phone also keeps this ping data for a few days for this very purpose. They can also use other data, such as WiFi or mobile data usage, or they can get a GPS fix as well.

I think you're misunderstanding: you'd tokenize on sentences for the purposes of training, so an entity that gets scored is a full sentence. But part of the training/scoring pipeline would be to do some processing on the input sentence: either chunk that sentence up into words, or even go down to the character level (which sounds insane, but is actually the state of the art with neural language models). Recursive neural networks are tolerant of variable length inputs, so regardless how many characters/words/tokens are in a particular sentence, we could pass a full sentence into the model and it would be able to do some sophisticated stuff figuring out how the different words work in relation to each other. 

Ultimately, a large amount of the lift from a model predicting suicidality is going to be honing in on certain words or phrases, like ""kill myself"" and ""end it all"". But building it this way makes it so the model figures out for itself what it's interested in.

There are a couple reasons why I specifically suggested classifying sentences rather than whole comments.

* A lot of posts in /r/suicidewatch are just titles, so it would allow us to normalize the training data to roughly equal size ""documents"". Otherwise, the model could become biased to expect that comments of certain length (e.g. either really short or really long) are predictive, when actually this would just be an artifact of how the data was constructed (title only submissions vs. self posts).

* It allows us to be more defensive. If someone expresses something dangerous in one sentence but goes and on about their school for the bulk of their comment, a model trying to classify the whole comment might correctly determine that the comment isn't *about* this person's thoughts about self-harm. Which would be true. It was just something they mentioned briefly, but we're still concerned. Classifying sentences instead of comments means each sentence is a new opportunity to throw a red flag, whereas classifying the whole comment means we only have one opportunity to make a decision.

Umm... citation? Please cite the specific section that says this, since I am not finding anything that confirms this. 

But even if you can cite it, you are still wrong. No one said anything about owning an explosive. The question was *explicitly* about *teaching*, not about *owning.* The citation you gave was about *teaching.* You then claimed that ""intent doesn't matter"", when the very citation you gave *explicitly says intent matters.*

>  Therefore, any audience viewing and using the tutorial to make a destructive device is committing a ""Federal crime of violence"". 

This is just laughably absurd. Do you really not think I could make a tutorial without actually owning a bomb? You have never seen a recipe? A written tutorial? Hell, even if I taught you in person and walked you through the process, I could do so using fake ingredients. 

>  And, therefore, you would be in violation of the law knowing the information you provided was used to create said destructive device.

You have never learned something simply for the sake of curiosity? I have watched videos and read tutorials on many things that I will likely never do.

I think it is safe to assume that you are not a lawyer?

Simply providing the information DOES NOT show intent. 

>  It would be easier for the Federal government to prove you provided the education knowing someone out there would use it illegally than it would be for you to prove you knew every single person that obtained the information would not use it illegally. 

Yes... Which is why if the intent did not matter  *they would not explicitly write it into the law that it does.* 

Your argument is just incredibly stupid. It literally makes no sense at all for them to include two very specific clauses about intent if they mean it to apply universally. They would only be providing a possible loophole that people could get out of.

This still does mean, however, that they are linked in some way; someone that Wikileaks trusts enough to provide accurate leakable documents has ties to Russian Intelligence.

This was suspected when the timing of several emails from Clinton campaign staff was leaked through Wikileaks coincided directly with events that would have been a boost to the Clinton campaign (such as the Democratic convention and during the Trump ""grab them by the p****"" release).

Technically, we didn't really have much in the way of direct confirmation until the director of the FBI announced it as a part of his general report to the House Intelligence Committee on Russian Interference in the election on March 20th.

The full transcript is available on the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/), but the part that confirms it directly is here:

>SCHIFF: And there was an effort by the Russians to cover up their break-in of the Democratic Party headquarters, by using cutouts like WikiLeaks to publish the stolen material, isn't that right?

> COMEY: Certainly to cover up their -- that they were the ones releasing it.

It's mentioned again here:

>SCHIFF: This is a question I think you can answer. Do you know whether the Russian intelligence service has dealt directly with WikiLeaks or whether they too used an intermediary?

>COMEY: We assessed they used some kind of cutout. They didn't deal directly with WikiLeaks. In contrast to D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0.

And one more time here:

>[CASTRO]: So, let's move to WikiLeaks for a moment, who played such a prominent role in the 2016 election. As has established before and reestablished at this hearing, WikiLeaks was at a minimum an unwitting pawn and, at a maximum, an active co-conspirator of the Kremlin's in publishing stolen DNC and senior Democratic officials' e-mails. And so you agree this was done in order to offer Moscow some measure of separation as to mask its hand in having hacked and stolen the data in the first place, but so it could still have it publicly posted to inflict damage on the Clinton campaign?

>COMEY: Yes, I think that's fair.

I wouldn't say this means that Wikileaks is 100% compromised by Russian Intelligence. And heck, it might still meet your definition of ""trustworthy source"" since the leaks they provided on behalf of Russian Intelligence were still technically accurate.

But there's one pretty damn trustworthy source: the director of the FBI confirming that Wikileaks released documents on behalf of Russian Intelligence, somewhere between being a pawn or an active co-conspirator.",False,False,False,12232,96,1319339414.0,False,False

This could simply be a difference of what OP was talking about and what I was asking for.  I wanted a news article, or a page promoting his assassination.  Not some random tom dick or harry loon suggesting it.  

It's a piece of cake for some crazy person to do or say something like that, but it's an entirely different situation if you have an actual post about assassinating a president being upvoted and promoted by a subreddit.

This is a separate illegal act and is unrelated to the legality of their presence in this country. I agree that it is a problem that needs to be addressed.

Would you even be willing to accept that I agree with you? Our immigration system is massively flawed. There needs to be a systematic overhaul of the entirety of the process. We absolutely need to secure our borders, if only for national security and anti-cartel reasons. 

My only problem is that the *reality* of decades of failed reform and failed enforcement has lead us to a world where illegal immigrants are so entwined in our economy that it would be suicidal to contemplate anything except their continued residence inside of our country. Ignoring literally dozens of other equally compelling rationales, I am very serious that we cannot displace the 12+ million people in this country illegally without irreparably fucking ourselves. There isn't a way around that.

Yes, I am for euthanasia. I also agree with you (kind of inferring here) that mental illness is too often perceived to be not as disabling or problematic as physical illness. The difference, to me, is that our ability to gauge whether or not a mental illness is treatable is far more nebulous than our ability to come to the same conclusion for physical disabilities. I suppose it's also a bit of a Catch 22 situation to mandate that euthanasia on the basis of mental illness be chosen in sound mind.    

However, to my knowledge the vast majority of mental illnesses which commonly drive people to suicide are in fact treatable, though the amount of attention and effort necessary (whether by the troubled person in question or a professional) may be particularly extensive.  

Also, one of the big differences between euthanasia and suicide is the process. I forget where I read this (so please tell me if this has been debunked – it's been years death was so present in my life) but to my understanding, many suicidal individuals act not only impulsively, but have little concept of the long term. The findings explained that the content of suicide notes is more often very immediate stuff like ""i'm sorry"" or simply things that have led up to it or what's going on in their minds at the moment, rather than planning for their absence or anything of the like. Sure, they might not care about that stuff because they intend to die, but in that case they probably wouldn't leave a note in the first place. SO, I think in the case of euthanasia, the process of applying and waiting for it allows for time to cool down and consider what they're doing before choosing such a dramatic solution.

*If you were to read only one part of this post, I would hope it's this:*

I think euthanizing someone as a result of mental illness is quite different from what I would explicitly refer to as suicide because it would involve a clinical expert, and would likely be a longer process. This allows time for critical thought. I just don't believe in suicide as opposed to euthanasia, as one involves a mentally ill person – alone – making a drastic decision that they might otherwise regret if they were of sound mind, while another involves someone who is definitely capable of rational thought, is equipped to help, and can offer a slew of potential, less tragic solutions first.",False,False,False,104732,12112,1285702241.0,False,False

Yes. Just like your home, or your own club would.

Instead, these bridagers could have started their own ""sports"" club where they can vote on the sport they are playing that week. This is difference between broad political subs like r/politics and specific ones like /r/SandersForPresident and r/the_donald. If a sub is dedicated to discourse and discussion, great! If not, great! **This is the whole function and entire purpose of subreddits.**

 That is what would have happened to r/the_donald. Brigading (despite being against reddit rules) would have torn the sub apart. Most subs are in some way a ""safe space"". I mentioned this in my last comment. Subs are specific targets of content. What would happen if every sub had to allow content that was irrelevant to their interests?! Reddit wouldn't be what is it without subs and the ability to direct content. Are you arguing for anarchy? Where any content is allowed on any sub regardless of whether it fits its purpose?

They are claiming to be like /r/politics - open for dissent, but then they are silencing those that don't agree with that weeks safe space doctrine.

Why do their views deserve to be protected, when they so obviously wrong/immoral? Because we as a society have no perfect or objective standards by which to determine for political purposes whether or a type of speech is immoral, short of it inciting imminent violence. The will of the popular majority on any particular issue isn't good enough. Sure, holocaust denial seems like something that most society pretty widely accepts as false/immoral, but where does one draw the line? Should climate-denial be outlawed? Most Americans don't believe in evolution; should we be able to legislate against promoting/teaching it?

I was not trying to answer the question of whether or not Wikileaks was actively working with Russia. In fact, at the bottom of my post I point out that depending on your definition of ""trustworthy"" you may still consider Wikileaks to be trustworthy, since (at this time) our information suggests that they are a) not working together actively and b) still released true leaks.

However, *working together* is not logically equivalent to *linked to*. There is absolutely no doubt Wikileaks is linked to Russia. Documents stolen by Russia went to Wikileaks on behalf of Russian Intelligence, which means there is a chain of trusted groups/individuals that links Wikileaks and Russian intelligence.

If we had applied harsh censorship to this specific subject as Germany had, I believe this could have been avoided. And this revisionism becoming mainstream has had an extremely important real-world impact; our relations with our neighbors is strained in large part because of this. I hate the current political situation, being a military puppet of the United States while in petty disputes with the countries we should be working with. I have an immense amount of pride in my country for what we've accomplished since the war, but I envy Germany who managed to not only rebuild into a world power themselves, but also embraced the mistakes of their past and worked through them to create an extremely tight bond with its former enemies.  

I went off on a bit of a tangent, but that's why I think censorship has value when used carefully. It's true that there's a fine, fine line about legislating speech like this, and it's impossible to be perfectly objective, but if you don't try when the stakes are acceptably high, what should be a fringe, morally unacceptable position can eventually find its way accepted back into the society. Trusting society to self-police itself well is dangerous, when you consider the fact that society once already embraced these ideas enough to fight World War II in the first place.  

And with those thoughts in mind, I do think that advocating for the murder of political opponents crosses that fine line as something that is clearly morally objectionable enough to be censored.

There is no such thing as a government, just people, like me. And how do these people assert their power? More people, just like me, but with badges that say ""l'etat, c'est moi"". Perhaps that, then, is a good standard to hold myself to. I'll treat nazis the same way the police treat young black men who, again, are just more people -- that is to say, gun them down in the street.

The point is, ultimately, somebody has to stand up and say ""No more!"". The so called ""government"" has shown itself time and time again to be ultimately concerned with one thing, and one thing only: the preservation of it's own power. Why, then, would it even have a problem with fascism, or with genocide? Both are aimed to expand and consolidate state power, and therefore do not conflict with the goals of the state. So if not me, then who?

I would guess that your position is one of rule utilitarianism: that free speech can only be preserved if it is applied and adhered to universally. It's not a bad idea, and, in theory, I'm inclined to agree. The issue, though, is predicated on that last word ""universally"". Rule utilitarianism neccesitates that the rule, in this case ""free speech"" be applied universally, because any violation of that rule invalidates the whole thing. And -- and I do know I'm assuming here -- therein lies your objection. That if we say it is ok to violate a nazi's right of free speech, our right is lost. The problem with that is that ""free speech"" as a sacred principle has been violated again and again, and not equitably.

Essentially, we have almost universally acknowledged that the ""right"" of free speech comes with qualifications. The most common example is yelling ""fire!"" in a movie theater -- we know that it is speech, as an action, but it does not hold any merit as communication and poses a danger to others. To take that a step further, most people would acknowledge that organizing a lynch mob is *not* speech -- it is an incitement to violence. What, then, is the difference in trying to organize a group of people whose ultimate goal is ethnic cleansing? The time frame? Planning and organizing ethnic cleansing is not ""speech"". It is an incitement to violence​, and this incitement to violence is implicit in National Socialism.

The police don't do anything. The government seeks only to perpetuate its own power. So the only objection that remains is ""why me?"". The only answer I can proffer at this point is this: ""Why *not* me?""

And there are still enclaves in every major city in America for every cultural group you can think of.

Again, literally not. That NIGHT the top post of the sub was about how he was always a shady guy.

And if you guys think that he wanted immunity to say he had nothing, you guys don't understand the fundamental points behind immunity.

If he did nothing wrong, he has no need for immunity. If he asks for it, he needs to give them something in trade for it. If he gives them something and then goes on the stand and says something else, that immunity can and would be revoked as it is *always* conditional on what is said under oath matches what they were told to offer.

Yes, sometimes morally unacceptable views become mainstream and lead to bad cultural outcomes like imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, but I think that the rise of those societies usually coincides with government repression of dissenting views.

Letting the people set up shop in broad daylight legitimatizes their beliefs. It shows that it's an at least somewhat acceptable norm.

That is why I said ""I digress"". The basis of my argument is on the economic impact illegal aliens have in the US.

>Illegal immigrants are hurting american wages

As shown in the article I linked to you: the jobs occupied by illegal immigrants aren't filled by native citizens when they have the opportunity to. There is no ""american wage"" because they simply do not live near/don't choose to be employed in those shitty jobs. Sincerely, your premise is wrong. They aren't 'stealing jobs' or 'lowering wages'. These are jobs that, traditionally, never existed in the US because no one wants to do them. They are shit jobs, and when illegal aliens are suppressed from taking them, they stay empty. 

> sure agriculture prices will increase but you are strongly overestimating the impact. 

[Here](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/08/17/could-farms-survive-without-illegal-labor/the-costs-and-benefits-of-a-raise-for-field-workers) is an interesting article about it. In order to fill the jobs with American workers, we would have to pay them 3-4-5x the amount of an illegal alien. This would raise the cost to the American consumer by 15-20%. I'm not sure about you, but increasing the cost of already expensive fresh fruits and vegetables by 20% isn't affordable for most households, particularly for the aforementioned near-poverty line ones. This, of course, ignoring the fact that the costs to the farmers aren't just in the form of increased labor costs. They would have to start taking workplace safety and hours into serious consideration. Long story short, it would hammer some of the already hardest hit areas of our country. 

Simply, labor supply on a continental scale isn't elastic. It's taken decades for the supply and demands of various laborers and labor-sources to balance out. Any rapid adjustment to the system would have to take that cost into account. Can we really afford to fuck around with this petty crap? Like do you want to spend cool hundred billion dollars trying to iron out a matter that boils down to simple paper-work? 

More so; I don't argue with the value of temporary work visas. But it doesn't address the fact that we still have people who have no place to go. Very literally, what is the point of taking a hard-working dude, who's been here for 35 years and dumping him at the border of a country he hasn't seen in ever, with zero connections or resources? Why fuck with shit like that? Now we have even more destitute people who need assistance. 

I understand your points. I get that it's a shitty spot to find ourselves in. Very much ignoring the human element of this equation: our unemployment stands at 7.5 million people. There are approximately that many employed illegal immigrants. You tell me how we facilitate, cheaply and efficiently, the transfer of those jobs to people who, very obviously, live in completely geographically distinct areas of the country. How do we do that?

And again: this has nothing to do with race. I don't think you're racist. In fact, no one who's serious about the subject on the left thinks that people like yourself are racist. You want to secure the country. We do too. We want everyone to pay takes, you do too. We all want our country to be as economically successful as possible and we want our government to spend our hard earned money in the most efficient way possible. Working forward from that standard I hope we can agree on a couple basic tenants:

1) Means of legal immigration must be expanded to address the needs of our economy and to reduce the allure of illegal immigration. 

2) Our borders must be protected from criminal elements, even at the expense of normal people looking to immigrate illegally. 

3) We must secure our economic foundations and find a way of removing the black market of labor that illegal aliens operate in via a non-disruptive naturalization channel. 

If that seems like a reasonable middle ground to you, then I'd love to talk about detailed policy. It also happens to represent the majority democratic opinion on the subject. ",False,False,False,166847,17728,1416264286.0,False,True

All cultures cause conflict when they come together.  
All of them.

English and Irish and French and Spanish and Italian and Greek and Swedish and Swiss and Russian and Portuguese and Danish and Chinese and Japanese and Indian and Indonesian and  Australian and South African and Moroccan and Egyptian and Iranian and Iraqi and Turkish and Mexican and Canadian and Bolivian and Brazilian and Uruguayan and etc etc etc. All of them came to American, have retained much of their culture, assimilated much of other cultures and become America.

People from every Muslim nation on the planet have emigrated to the US and they have lived here in the same community as me and you, in the same city and county and state as me and you, and they have done so without causing a net negative in your life at all.

Huh... How about that...

Read critically. *Your* culture doesn't determine *my* laws and *my* culture doesn't determine *your* laws. I would imagine someone who is seemingly so versed as you are in the assimilation of America would have recognized the paraphrased statement, since it comes from probably the most important era of our country's history.

It was spoken by Henry Clay on the Senate Floor during a speech when they were deciding the Compromise of 1850. Maybe you'd know the full quote better?

""The disparate cultures of the Southern States, from Louisiana to Virginia and even my home of Kentucky do not determine the laws of the North, just as the social constructs of the Northern States of Pennsylvania and New York do not determine the laws of the South. We are here, in this Great Experiment, to show the world that men from cultures from every end of the map can learn from each other, and grow together to form a more perfect Union. For if we do not or can not, the Union will fall.

Meaning? America is a land where all cultures not only can come together, but should come together. That was true in the 18th century when we fought for Independence, that was true in the 19th century when we fought to preserve the Union, and it was true in the 20th century when we fought to stop a man and his followers from wiping out other cultures they deemed ""incompatable"".

Lesse, this has been, from start to finish, a conversation specifically about how you feel that Islam is incompatable with America. Do you really want to try and tell me that this whole time that you have been focused on Islam that you meant that one singular statement, without qualification, to be about multiple cultures?

You don't think k the artwork of Islamic countries could create conflict?

Do me a favor, Google ""Islamic Artwork"" and tell me what you DONT see. And I'm not talking about Mohammed, either, although that is an offshoot of this.

*There are no people.* It's not just the image of Mohammed that is forbidden, it is the image of any man or woman because they believe it it an affront to Allah to try and duplicate his perfect creation, man.

And even beyond that, as you see, you are keen on highlighting the *differences* in people. I'm keen on highlighting the *similarities*.

And I believe that this is the crux of this whole thing here. I don't see Muslims as all that different from anyone else. They may believe in God a different way, and that may make other uncomfortable, and it may scare them, as it has made you uncomfortable and as it has scared you, but it doesn't make me uncomfortable. It doesn't scare me. Because as more Muslim men, women and children come to America, just as more Mexican men, women and children come to America, and more people from China and India and Pakistan and Europe and Africa come to America, we and they will do as we have done for 200+ years. We will come together and learn from each other and grow with each other and become better than we were because we are here, together.

So you can keep on trying to convince me that your version of what you think is American culture is now perfect and should be closed off, but I'll never believe that.

For logged-out and new users, you want to present your best guess for what subreddits an average user will want to see.  Landing on /r/popular is exactly the right thing: users see every subreddit, except those that want to be filtered and those that users filter above some rate. Using blacklists instead of a whitelist plays to reddit's strength: the amazing variety of communities. Another strength of reddit is the rate at which novel communities form, and /r/popular allows viewers to see new communities as soon as they become popular--without admin intervention.

This leaves what subbreddits to show logged-in users. Without user intervention, this should still be /r/popular: after all, it's your best guess and you don't have any extra information yet.

Right now, the model appears to be:

* sign up
* while browsing /r/popular, subscribe to lots of subreddits
* switch to reddit.com at some point

This has the same problems for logged-in users that the old frontpage had for non-logged-in users: even with dozens of subscriptions, it only covers a fraction of the site and it doesn't react well to new community development. It also creates a huge barrier to entry: creating a decent subreddit collection might take dozens or hundreds of clicks.

I think a better model is to encourage users to begin with a good starting point (/r/popular) and then gradually modify it to fit their tastes by adding and removing subreddits. Adding is a no-brainer: a user's subscription to a sitewide-filtered subbreddit should cause it to show up on /r/popular for them anyway.

Subtraction presumably requires more work, but I think it should be a core reddit feature. Subreddit filtering should be promoted to the same prominence and usability as subreddit subscription: the same list should filter both /r/all and /r/popular, it shouldn't be limited to just 100 entries, and it should have the same UI as for subscription: a ""filter"" button both beneath each post on /r/popular and on each subreddit page and a central page to manage a user's filtered subreddits.

In this model, ""subscribe"" links beneath each post on /r/popular aren't nearly as useful: there's never a reason to switch to reddit.com, so subscription does nothing to subreddits a user is already seeing on /r/popular.

**TL;DR:**
I'm proposing the following model:

* New users go to /r/popular, before and after signup
* Users remove subreddits from their /r/popular by filtering from links below each post on /r/popular
* Users add (sitewide-filtered) subreddits to their /r/popular by subscribing from links on the subreddits' homepages

After a number of years James finally revisits Colombia to see Mike on his Birthday.  We discuss traveling through Mexico, one bag, playing city skylines and stories from Medellin.  James is infurated about the reciprocity tax but then forgets how to drive a manual car.  Mike can't handle watching no to psuedo-science and a lot more.

It's the safest fucking snowflake space in the history of the internet.


Gird your loins Reddit, and don't listen to their false equivalencies posted here and the incessant whining about how unfair it is.


They started this shit and benefitted from at least 10 months of ill gotten gains using Sticky manipulation, entire page auto-upvote scripts, botting to inflate their numbers, constant brigading, and submitting mountains of shitpost spam that had the de facto effect of censoring many other subreddits through flood technique.


I once used /r/all/rising as my go to for up to date threads across all of reddit and I noticed that by summer's end it was completely unusable due to the permanent 24/7 jam of auto generated spam posts clogging up page after page of organic results with T_D screeching to gain attention and cause drama.


Really, for the longest time SRS was the scary, lawless, boogeyman that would strive to make everyone's day a little more miserable, can you imagine if they had pulled any of this shit? The outcry for them to leave would deafen the admins, but suddenly an orange candidate comes along and that sub is given the most leeway I have ever seen on Reddit, curtailed only because they were antagonistically shitting up the front page every day.


They broke the contract of 'don't be a cunt to everyone', this is on them alone.

That said, _I'd really like to see Reddit move away from ""popular"" as its central organising conceit_.  There's a certain value to crowdsourcing, but it's highly limited, and the concept in general is vulnerable to any measure of flaws:

* Hivemind preferences, including downvotes for truth.
* Brigading.
* Bandwagonning -- [comments, posts, and subreddits are rewarded more for being _early_ than being _right_](http://minimaxir.com/2016/11/first-comment/).

My remarks come as a mod, poster, commenter, but most especially as a _reader_.  There's simply _so much crud_ in a typical Reddit thread, or in a typical Reddit sub, or in a multireddit.  And it's hard to cut through.

There are some tricks that can help:

* Adding `?depth=2` (or some other cut-off) to deep threads will show top-level posts and responses.  This helps trunk down long threads.

* If you have [RES](/r/enhancement) installed (and if you don't, **do, it's that fucking excellent**), you can collapse _all_ child threads.  Which fucking rocks.

* Opening a subreddit or multi in ""Search"", selecting ""Best"", and limiting to the past week or month will turn up the highest-rated posts of the recent past.  Because this is a popularity contest and _not_ a quality filter, you'll miss some bits, _but you also trim the obvious crud_, which helps.  (Sorting by ""most controversial"" is also highly recommended.)

Some subs do better -- I'm a huge fan of AskHistorians, Ask Science, etc.,  where the mods go to bat.  Others ... succumb.  Data is Beautiful has, since going Default, degraded from ""interesting data visualisation concepts"" to ""this statistic should be popular"".  And, yes, sometimes it is, but the original thrust of the sub has been lost.

I also realise that popularity _does_ work for some subs -- music or images, say.  And there are subs which fight the good fight.  But they're working _against_ what Reddit offers, not with it.

I'd like to see an improvement to this.

While roaming around page to page I found a difficulty that I would like to bring to your notice (please bear me if I go wrong hoping that I'm new and looking for different options around here).
It's just a thought that while I scroll down the page, the top portion disappears making the ""My Subreddits"" and all other ""subreddits"" and ""Profile name"" hidden. Could you make it fixed so that it can be seen while scrolling down the page?
Thank you in advance.

I'm not saying Reddit search couldn't be improved.  But compare to, say, Google+ search:

* Reddit allows search by subreddit.  Google+ search does not.
* Reddit allows search by author.  Google+ search does not.
* Reddit allows search by date, kind of.  Google+ search does not, at all.

Searching link submissions by title, yeah, that kind of sucks, but then, there's not much there there.  It's sort of a hard problem, and yes, _if that problem were prioritised heavily_, you might be able to improve on it.

What _does_ work, amazingly well, actually, is _searching a text-heavy self-text subreddit_ by keywords.  Because the entire text is searchable.

This is among the reasons I use Reddit, heavily, for posting my own material (dedicated subreddit):  I can search that sub and dig out posts of interest, which I do, _damned near every day_.

(Yes, it helps a lot that I wrote the original, and can usually figure out how I think, and what words I'd use for something.)

My biggest gripe?  That _comments_ aren't searchable.  For that, I've still got to fall back to DDG or Google (and, reservations excepted, Google is better) for search.

I could sub in many other sites:  Ello, Mastodon, Facebook:  absolutely abysmal search, **if it exists at all.**

That said we did find that a small hardcore group of users kept using those in thread replies to argue about the mod decisions which spammed up actual discussion submissions, so we implemented a rule that any discussion of moderation needed to be via mod mail or the user had to post their own meta text submission discussing their concerns.

What if you're posting against the grain or having civil discussions with people in an attempt to broaden their minds?  Simply posting on a sexist sub shouldn't be grounds for an automatic ban on another sub.  The user's actions should be taken into account, which a script cannot discern.

>You don't own the community so you don't make the rules. And Reddit shouldn't stop them from doing that.

For the most part, yes they should.  Reddit made that sub a default, which gives it more power.  If it was a private sub, then I'd fully agree with you.  I may even partially agree if it wasn't made a default, which never should've happened anyway, just like /r/atheism (of which I'm a subscriber) shouldn't have been a default.

I'm not even speaking specifically about t_d, of which I am not a user and, in fact, banned from.  This should be the general thinking.  If a user harasses your sub, ban them.  If they've never visited or only made a few comments that weren't bannable in and of themselves, then you shouldn't auto-ban them for visiting a sub that you disagree with.

Unsubscribe in one click--the button should be right there under the post. Browse a subreddit that isn't on your /r/popular? Subscribe right from the post or subreddit page. The subscribe button for this kind of subreddit (not on /r/popular for a user, but the user is browsing it anyway) needs to be way more prominent.

(Community discovery for sitewide-filtered communities is a tougher nut to crack. I personally would like a giant list of subreddits that (1) are sitewide filtered (2) I'm not subscribed to and (3) I haven't filtered. But this requires a user to think ""I should spend 5 minutes adding subreddits from some list"" making it useful only to dedicated users.)",False,False,1496270266.0,2342,200,1178158541.0,False,False

I subscribed initially years ago in order to filter out a few default subs that I did not care to see.  The advent of /r/popular is a great improvement, but it undoes what many of us subscribed in order to accomplish (filtering out stuff we specifically didn't care to see).  Subscribing to something should add it to the popular content, and there should be a ""hide"" separate from just subscribed or not subscribed that removes content from that sub from /r/popular entirely.  Think of it like the up or downvoting we have on posts, but for whole subreddits.  By default, all posts/subreddits are unvoted upon (neutral).  If you like it, you can upvote it for more like it.  If you don't like it, you can downvote it for less like it.

That's great for them, but for me it's reminiscent of fark.com; there are very few moderators and approvers there.  So all the postings become very formulaic because submissions are so tailored to a few tried and true memes.  Reddit has a ""flavor"" (for lack of a better word) that comes from the most prolific posters flooding the site in search of karma. They overwhelm everyone else and set a tone that permeates the site.

That's the subreddit where the mod [investigated and doxed](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3hpku7/slapfight_in_gamerghazi_after_a_mod_accidentally/) a game dev, then took a temporary leave of absence despite GamerGhazi subscriber objections (they're back now).

Also, several GamerGhazi users got together to dox someone in Japan, but failed spectacularly when it turned out it was all a sting operation (called ""ZachAttack"") to expose them as doxers and hypocrites.  

In fairness, that [didn't receive as much support](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/4x9knp/can_we_have_a_discussion_about_the_whole_mombot/) from GamerGhazi, so props to them for mostly disavowing the group.",False,False,False,297878,216807,1410576945.0,False,False

>Hi, 2XC. Since this thread's getting a fair amount of attention, I'd just like to take this opportunity to explain a few things around the situation **from an admin perspective** that I think it's useful for people to keep in mind as this topic continues to come up.

>I mostly just want to urge people to not take everything at face value. There are a lot of people that seem quite invested in trying to get the mods to remove this subreddit from the defaults, and unfortunately that means that they're willing to try to cheat, lie, and do various other unsavory things to influence this decision.

>For example, **the OP of this thread was using at least 5 alternate accounts** to attempt to tilt things in here, including upvoting their own submission and supportive comments (and they've now been banned from the site for that). There's generally just a great deal of attempted manipulation going on around the topic of 2XC being a default, between people attempting to manipulate votes, using multiple accounts to post comments supportive of their side, organized groups brigading relevant posts, etc. Some people have even been performing what's often referred to as a ""false flag"", where even though they're actually normally a contributing member of the subreddit, they've been **creating alt accounts to make or upvote harassing comments**/messages in order to make that issue seem more prevalent than it actually is.

>And on the topic of harassing PMs, one of the most frustrating aspects of the situation from our perspective is that there's been a significant amount of lying on this end. We've received quite a few reports about users who have claimed to have received a large amount of harassment, but **when we investigate we find that they've often never received any PMs at all**, or only one message when they claim to have received many. Some people have even gone so far as **creating alts to PM themselves** with, so that they can take screenshots for ""proof"".

>I'm certainly not trying to say that there hasn't been any harassment, because some definitely has actually occurred (and please report it to us by sending a modmail to /reddit.com if it happens to you). But between the various outside groups trying quite hard to push 2XC out, the false flags, and the lying, please take all claims about it with a large grain of salt.

>Just to be clear though, we'll be perfectly happy with whatever decision the subreddit eventually makes about whether to remain a default or not. We definitely like having it as a default (which is why we asked the mods if we could include it), but if they decide they've changed their mind, that's great as well. I'd just really like to see that the decision is made honestly, instead of as a result of all the manipulation going on around it.

As someone who is a scientist who studies communities, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls subreddits communities. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""community family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Communidae, which includes things from discord to facebook to digg.

So your reasoning for calling a subreddit a community is because random people ""call the black ones communities?"" Let's get irc and slack in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A subreddit is a subreddit and a member of the community family. But that's not what you said. You said a subreddit is a community, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the community family communities, which means you'd call facebook, discord, and other subreddits communities, too.

/r/libertarian/ - just... No. It isn't.


/r/ConservativeLounge/, /r/ConservativesOnly/, /r/ConservativeMeta/, /r/ConservativeLadies/ all have under 1000 subs. Don't think they count. If I was talking about all anti trump subs regardless of sub count we'd be here all month.

/r/climateskeptics/ - NO. Correlation does not mean it's a fucking trump subreddit. Stop.


/r/ConventionOfStates/ - Conservative. Not trump. That's a point you keep making here, which I have to address. You're showing subs which are either right wing, or about something which right wing people would be for. It doesn't work that way. We are talking about subs which are specifically pro Donald Trump. The anti trump movement have loads of anti trump subs, r/esist, r/marchagainsttrump, those are all specifically anti Donald trump. If I was talking about all anti trump subs, all democrat subs, and all subs which democrats would be for, I would be here all year.


/r/TheLibertyAmendments/ - 172 subs. Enough said.


/r/conservativecartoons/ - basically a branch of r/conservative. A tiny one at that.


/r/askaconservative/ - not Donald trump.


/r/UncensoredNews/ - Not. Donald Trump.


/r/WomenForTrump/ - Again, this one is a fair argument. But the sub is small, and hardly anyone knows about it.


/r/Trump_Train - another fair point, but, again, tiny.


/r/TrumpPA/ - Under 1000 subs.


/r/the_Donald_CA -yet another fair point. But small as well.


/r/The_Donald_Midwest - tiny.


/r/The_Donald_Texas - Tiny.


/r/The_DonaldBookclub - Tiny. Also, why.


/r/the_donaldaudiovisual - Where did you copy paste all the from? This has fucking 13 SUBS.


/r/The_DonaldUnleashed- Pretty small, hasn't ever hit r/all.


/r/Ask_TheDonald/ - Tiny, but I assume you mean r/Askthe_donald, which is a fair point. Probably the largest sub you've mentioned that is actually pro trump, not just right wing. Good work.


/r/AskTrumpSupporters/ - Same as above.


/r/DNCleaks - Not necessarily related to Trump, but closely tied. Notice how it is a neutral sub though, not a pro trump sub. It's just a sub to discuss an event, so not a pro Trump sub.


/r/Sorosforprison - Another good one, which is actually decently large. Strayed from its original purpose though, but still works.


/r/Our_Politics - LOOK AT THE NAME. NEUTRAL. POLITICS. NOT TRUMP. Half the stuff there is anti trump as well. The occasional good post about trump doesn't make the sub a pro trump sub.


/r/Bigly - Tiny.


/r/WikileaksTaskForce - NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO


/r/DisavowSanders - 12 FUCKING SUBSCIBERS. 12.


/r/PromiseToAssimilate - ok I'm starting to think this comment is a joke.


/r/THE_DONALD_TOO - I can tell you just went on Google, looked up ""anti trump subs"" copy pasted and that was it. You couldn't have looked through these, you couldn't have. Maybe you didn't expect me to spend so much time looking through these and reviewing them, either. Neither did I.


/r/trumpftw - You know, it's hard to have shit to say when there's only one sub. 


/r/The_Donald_TV/ - Oh fuck, we are getting back to the large subs, 95 whole subscribers. Oh fuck.


/r/The_Guacbowl/ - ... ITS FUCKING JEB BUSH. JEB. BUSH. WHAT THE FUCK. ARE YOU STUPID. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THESE FOR MORE THAN 2 SECONDS.


/r/TheNewRight/ - Thank god I can actually start saying things. Again, right wing≠pro trump.


/r/HillaryMeltdown/ - I'm not really too sure what to think of this one. It's more in the style of r/tumblrinaction, it's laughing at people freaking out. There are a lot of people there who support trump, but that's not really the point of it. I'm going to rule this one out as well.


/r/Donald_Trump/ - IT JUST LINKS YOU TO THE_MOTHER_FUCKING_DONALD


/r/LiberalMeltdown/ - Under 500 subs.


/r/disinformation/ *Oh fuck, 20 whole subs. Never mind, I was wrong. There are millions of pro trump subs. You've got me here.*


/r/ITprobe - Think my sanity is starting to slip here.


/r/Obamagate - I hope someone is reading these, this has taken almost half an hour. If you've read this, please respond with ""Oman am not gud with computer plz to help"".


/r/CNNleaks - Tiny.


/r/inthenews - No, it's a news subreddit. Not a trump subreddit.


/r/45th_President/ - 14 subs, 10 of which are mods.


/r/WomenMirinTrump/ - Just no.


/r/el_donaldo/ - Not only is this a sub with 6 subscribers, but it's a satire sub.


/r/Trumpland/ Uno. Dos. Tres Subscriptiones.
/r/Clinton4Prison/ - This one mystifies me. 1 sub yet 2 mods. One of those mods are not loyal.


/r/Info_Wars/ - Tiny.


/r/wikileaks - No. No. That's wikileaks. Again, correlation does not mean it's pro Trump. Stop.


/r/Our_Politics/ - You listed this one twice.


/r/Bigly/ - You listed this twice as well.


/r/HillaryForPrison/ - Oh my god it's one which j can say something about. This was made by trump supporters, definitely, but I'm not sure if it can be classified as a pro trump sub. While all the anti trump subs want him out of office, this sub wants someone in prison. So it's not really for trump's presidency as it is pro Hillary in prison.


/r/TheRecordCorrected/ - 3k subs. Kinda large. More for trying to stop democrats than anything. So I would consider it an anti-democrat sub instead of a pro trump sub.

(Fun fact, my autocorrect tried to correct anti-democrat into anti-Semitism. Sounds​ like it's trying to suggest something ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


/r/HillarysHealth/ - And to end all this, a sub which is tiny. Great.

All in all, out of the subs you've shown me, I would consider about 5 of them to be prominent pro trump subs. The rest are just random subs, shit, and tiny things. So yeah. Just spent 50 minutes doing that. Did you even look at those?",False,False,1496272315.0,231139,70583,1459099924.0,False,True

There would be some obvious obstacles and growing pains for certain subs, but I can say that without forced defaults a lot of people would naturally find a community of subs instead of just being automatically subbed to just a single default which would act as a community.

An example of a community that would mesh well would be something along the lines of a fail multi incorporating subs like /r/instant_regret, /r/nononono, /r/holdmybeer, etc....

Also, might as well ban r/politics r/news r/worldnews if you haven't already. There is nothing but the stuff you want to avoid there.

A caveat, this bottom list might include a few subs that are not as active as they used to be, like the previous list from the other poster. I don't ban as many left-leaning subs compared to right ones, so my knowledge of what makes it to the top is skewed in the opposite direction, but I can tell you what consistently makes it to the top from the left because I have not ban-listed the ones that might have shown up once or twice but have since then fallen off. It's just a personal banlist from the opposing viewpoint, mine (with a few subs I don't mind but realize are annoying added in). 

Ban at your discretion, but unless you are diving deeper than the first five pages of r/all before you refresh to the top again, then these are honestly all you should worry about. And if I am mistaken, and they are an issue to you, then ban them as you see them at that point.

Don't waste your limited banlist on irrelevant garbage that rarely ever makes it to r/all, though.

You can also filter a ton of porn and shocking content (ie r/WTF ) by going to 'content options' in your preferences and unchecking 'I am 18+ and am willing to view adult content', which will prune a good number of subs without needing to prune them manually and waste spots in your banlist.

The outcome is that you lose a vast majority of the people who are willing to do the time consuming work because of the unjustified backlash.  Many great mods left ELI5 because some mob harassed them to the end of the earth because they removed a post **publicly** with a public stickied mod comment that absolutely deserved to be removed.  Making that easier for the outrage machine to pour over ensures basically the only people who end up are mods are the ones who give absolutely zero shit what any of their members want.  Is that your ideal world, because that's what you'd get. 

So again, I'd like you to imagine yourself as the person picking up trash getting screamed at all day.  Would you tell the person who isn't willing to be screamed at while picking up trash ""if you feel comfortable picking up trash without being screamed at, but not being screamed at, youre doing something wrong""?  Of course not, it's just absurd, but that's what you're saying here.

> Look at all the political subreddits that have the majority of comments removed

Why are you picking out political subreddits here in particular?  /r/science, /r/askscience, /r/history and /r/askhistoricans are higher up than any of them.  Why not focus on that?  I'd wager it's because you do recognize that removal of comments is justified in many cases, but in the case **you** care about it's most likely not justified.  

ELI5 has 42% or so, do you want to know why?  Because popular threads end up with stuff like this, which is common:

http://imgur.com/a/UmGEZ

Now imagine that someone had a mod log they could point their outrage machine at ELI5 and say ""ELI5 is removing all references to monsanto! GET THEM!"".  How effective do you think that would be even though it's obviously wrong (we remove low-effort comments)?  Do you think the mob will maintain their composure and analyze context?  Do you think if a person removed those comments as opposed to automod that ELi5 would be better off with that mod driven away?  Why?

That part's not possible. The rest is entirely doable.

The search term is straightforward enough.

Use `author:usernamegoeshere` to limit it to submissions by a specific user.

`subreddit:subredditnamegoeshere` does what you would expect.

You can search by flair by using `flair_text:flairtextgoeshere` (or `flair:flairtextgoeshere`, which reddit interprets the same way) to search flair text, or `flair_css_class:cssclassgoeshere` to search for posts with a specific flair CSS class.

If you don't know which subreddit you posted in, I'm not sure why you'd want to specify a subreddit (unless it's something you've mentioned in a ridiculous number of posts, and you just happen to be looking for a specific post among them). You can use the `OR` boolean operator for fielded searches; for text searches you can use a pipe character (`|`).

All of that information is on the [search wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search), linked from the dropdown that appears when you click the search text area (at the top right of a reddit page) and then click `advanced search: by author, subreddit...`.

By the way, [searching for `VPN author:loki_racer`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=VPN+author%3Aloki_racer&restrict_sr=&sort=relevance&t=all) only gives one result - [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/58q9j4/mobile_device_attempts_to_connect_to_ipsec_vpn/) in /r/PFSense - so the other fields wouldn't really be necessary for this search.",False,False,False,227846,99769,1267699188.0,False,True

As someone who is a scientist who studies senates, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Palpatines senates. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""senate family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Senatae, which includes things from Congresses to Senates to Houses.

So your reasoning for calling Palpatine the senate is because random people ""call him the Senate?"" Let's get Darth Plageus and Count Dooku in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a jedi or an sith? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A Palpatine is a Palpatine and a member of the Senate family.

You said a Palpatine is a Senate, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Palpatine family senates, which means you'd call Vaders, Mauls, and other Siths senates, too.

**What is Reddit?**
> Reddit is a platform for communities to discuss, connect, and share in an open environment, home to some of the most authentic content anywhere online. The nature of this content might be funny, serious, offensive, or anywhere in between. While participating, it’s important to keep in mind this value above all others: show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is.

Enforcement for removing prohibited content is clearly defined as a site-wide admin role, not a moderators.

So you believe transparency in moderation leads to people forming opinions that are:

* unjustified
* random
* emotionally heated

I find your response very strange, as subreddits that try to maintain transparency seem to have much less of this (we're both using anecdotal evidence, but I'm really trying to be sincere about what I see (I'm sure you are too)).

> So again, I'd like you to imagine yourself as the person picking up trash

Reddit is a place for comments, if a moderator decides that no one should see that comment, there should be a reason. When theres no reason, people get upset. If someone is being rude/hostile/disrespectful towards a moderator than thats a perfect reason to ban someone. Moderators can only be respected when they show the same respect, thats how the world works for everything.

> are higher up than any of them. Why not focus on that? I'd wager it's because you do recognize that removal of comments is justified in many cases, but in the case you care about it's most likely not justified.

Thats a valid question! Thats because those subreddits are **incredibly transparent** in how they moderate. The mods of /r/science delete a TON of comments because they're jokes/comedic/not serious.

Anti-Trump subs seem to be more popular since the election, true.

Especially given the spam of the last year from a certain sub, and a handful of subs that grew in response for people that got sick of it. They carried the torch of critique after the election was won in the favor of the candidate they opposed. If you saw the front page at any point last year, and up until the admins intervened early this year to remove gamed posts and put a limit on the space available to a certain subreddit, the backlash was inevitable, especially because the main objective of that initial sub had been met (getting Trump elected) and posters had less drive to visit, freeing up all of that frontpage real estate that was previously occupied.

I still feel like with the exception of /r/MarchAgainstCheeto and /r/esista-sista, there aren't a ton of anti-Trump subs that frequently get to the front page.  But I agree that they do it specifically TO get to the front page, and that's lame a good candidate for filtering.

>that is what distorts the experience - not over-filtering.

Now you're just putting words in my mouth.  I never said anything about ""the experience"" or ""distorting"" it.  I'm just saying that it's really easy to just ignore most of the stuff, especially if you turn on the option to hide downvoted posts.

>No it doesn't. There just needs to be enough salty people whose intention is to force their ideas in the faces of people 

It's possible for some subs of a certain size to abuse it this way.  I agree.

>people who mostly just want to see cute kids doing karate and gifs of people falling off of things.

See, this is my problem with what you're saying.  You seem to have this idea of what reddit ""should be.""  And to you it ""should be"" cute kids and people falling.  That is NOT what I want, and would really hate that.  If you want something other than a fluid, changing ""experience,"" then you need to sub subreddits that fit what you like.  You don't get to pick /r/all, and the filters aren't meant to be ""the ant-subscription tool.""",False,False,False,193819,166,1259880958.0,False,True

Can we take a step back from the bias for a second?

The reason T_D ""throws a fit flailing on the floor"" was because it was specifically directed at them first, for quite a long time, before it ever happened to any other sub. And while I take issue with your claim that ETS ""happily complies"" they literally could not complain about it on any rational level simply because the rule was already implemented for another sub.

Now, if we had a sub called r/SexyMrSkeltal and lots of people visited and shitposted about how great SexyMrSkeltal was and then suddenly reddit told all it's users (and only it's users) that they could not do something every other sub could do, you can pretty much bet that the users of r/SexyMrSkeltal would be pretty hysterical about it.

The majority of them are good people who are in a terrible situation and I feel for them. I've been going down the documentary rabbit hole on ISIS and seeing what they do to the Shia Muslims in their own countries makes me sick.

That being said, I don't think we should take refugees into our countries by the (figurative) boatload.

Right now, we're fighting an ideological war with radical Islamists. Anyone who has ever read some of ISIS's essays to their followers can see that the only way to appease them is to convert to their radical brand of Islam. We cannot reason with these people. Obviously not all refugees are affiliated with ISIS, the vast majority are trying to escape them.

ISIS has managed to convince a pretty large army to follow them. If we bring enough refugees from these countries with a high ISIS presence, I think it's logical to assume that the ideological problems/civil war would eventually follow them.

Another reason I don't think we should be accepting a lot of refugees is because of simple economics. Most of these refugees are most likely poor and uneducated (one of the reasons they need our help). Poor and uneducated people commit a disproportionate amount of crime. It has nothing to do with skin color, religion, whatever. I think we need to be careful if we're bringing in people who will be overrepresented in crime statistics.

Fighting ISIS is a challenge though. I think if we could establish some safe spaces over there with a secure perimeter for women and children, it would go a long way. However, I really don't know if that would work. 

It's just such a delicate situation, no one is really sure of the right answer. Taking in refugees is good in theory, but we have to drive ISIS out of the Middle East eventually. Are we just going to keep taking in refugees until only ISIS remains in the Middle East?

> There's no way to prove ""evidence"" of anything at this point.

You give entirely too much credit to our intelligence agencies.  CrowdStrike is a highly reputable firm.  Did you read their report?  Hackers leave unique traces, like the tools and specific code they use. Crowdstrike's blog post about their report doesn't indicate any doubt as to the origin of the hacks. Not only are they certain these were Russian actors, but they clearly identified that there were two different groups of attackers, and ""immediately"" recognized the specific identities of those groups:

> We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR. We’ve had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well.

Now, if you want to argue that the ""FBI/CIA"" (which one are you specifically alleging?) planted evidence, over a prolonged period of time (going back to Summer 2015), I suppose that's your right, but (a) that would require a level of sophistication that I don't believe those agencies possess, and (b) the longer the list of conspirators, the more Occam's Razor supports my argument.

For your theory to be true, at minimum, we'd need a cover up by some number of people at the FBI/CIA, some number of people at the Washington Metro Police Dept, and some number of people at the DNC.  All of these people would have had to get together and coordinate this effort somehow, which you have no evidence for.  Plus, the FBI/CIA and police have no known motive to perform this conspiracy and cover it up. Plus, it's their duty to, you know, enforce the law.

How many subreddits that potentially cover controversial topics (like most big generic subs), and are also huge do this?  I'm not aware of a ton.  Did those subs have these sorts of enormous mobs after clearly justified actions before becoming transparent?

> Reddit is a place for comments, if a moderator decides that no one should see that comment, there should be a reason. 

Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean there wasn't a reason.  I'm sure you aren't proposing that mod actions are done completely arbitrarily from the perspective of the mod right?

Even if there is a reason, do you think the subreddit would be better off when mods have to spend their time **constantly** relitigating the same thing all the time over and over again with hundreds of people?

> If someone is being rude/hostile/disrespectful towards a moderator than thats a perfect reason to ban someone. Moderators can only be respected when they show the same respect, thats how the world works for everything.

If you've ever modded a big sub, you know that bans are not enough to stop one person from making your life very difficult, let alone hundreds or thousands.

> I think the mods of /r/history have one of the best track records on this entire site.

They remove holocaust denial related posts.  People bring that up all the time.  I'm sure you have no problem with that, because that's fringe enough and I'm sure you agree that's stupid.  But why don't you think that isn't very clearly posted in the rules or sidebar?  Wouldn't that be more transparent?

-----

I hope I can circle back to my analogy and you can comment on it, because I think it's very relevant here.

> So again, I'd like you to imagine yourself as the person picking up trash getting screamed at all day. Would you tell the person who isn't willing to be screamed at while picking up trash ""if you feel comfortable picking up trash without being screamed at, but not being screamed at, youre doing something wrong""? Of course not, it's just absurd, but that's what you're saying here.

I've modded ELI5 for 4 years, and I've seen a lot of mods come through who tried very hard to enforce the rules.  Some were VERY visible intentionally, going to great lengths to explain everything.  Others, who modded similar posts/comments in the same way, were less visible, sending PMs at best to people.  The former **always** burn out, and ELI5 is worse because they're gone.  We lost a handful of mods who were like that man on the highway, toiling all the time picking up trash, but eventually they were screamed away for a perfectly reasonable action.  There are not unlimited people who care enough to be mods and do it well for no pay while giving a shit what people think, and basically what is being proposed here is ""I would like all of those people to be driven away"".

In my vision of an ideal communist society, money would not exist. Therefore, the economy would be a fairly pointless thing to use as a societal measuring tool. Goods and services would be exchanged for other goods and services, as in times before money. Therefore, I might call myself a bit of a primitivist.

>Do totalitarianism and communism go hand in hand?

No, but the way communism has been implemented in the past has allowed for corruption to slowly weave its way up into the top ranks and turn the government into a totalitarian regime. In some cases, the government was already totalitarian due to the nature of the leader(s) of the revolution in a particular country. I'm a libertarian socialist, so I think the government should take a hands-off approach, mainly being focused on defending the country, somewhat regulating trading, and making sure people do not attack each other.

>Is it possible for everyone to enjoy a high standard of living under communism?

Personally, I think that a high standard of living is unnecessary, if we're talking about it in the sense of ""I'm rich and have lots of cool stuff!"" Under the system that I have in mind, it should be possible for anybody who does their fair share of work to enjoy a life similar to upper middle-class living in the USA right now.

One flaw that I have found within my plan is that people with skills in niche places might not be able to trade well enough and would be stuck at a lower standard of living.

I'm not short on guts, but this subreddit's seven-minute cooldown is rather offputting. I can tell that you're debating me in good faith and not some shilling agenda-pusher, so I would be very happy to try to understand why we disagree. I am certain it's because we are getting our information from different sources. Or maybe moreso that you are being deliberately cut off from information by sources that want to hide it from you. 

Right from the start, I can see that for some unclear reason you give credence to anything that corporate media, the alphabet soup agencies, or political parties have to say. I lost the ability to believe any of them long ago. 

This is my new hobby now - following political discussions and information sources. So I receive a lot of bits of info from a lot of places, and it can be time-consuming to trace back to what article or what new site or what other source I saw information. But there's a critical mass of info sources or incidents that start to make it statistically impossible for some things not to be so, or things just logically make more sense than others. I'll gladly try to elucidate to you why I think what I think, but if I get that seven-minute warning again I'm going to get pissed off, and then I don't want to do it here.

Why is that specific trash collector getting yelled at? If every trash collector has the same role and resources, would every trash collector be getting yelled at constantly? I believe mandatory transparency of moderation would make it much more difficult to target a specific person. 

> I'm sure you aren't proposing that mod actions are done completely arbitrarily from the perspective of the mod right?

I think the majority of mods do what they feel is best to facilitate discussion. During my 7 years on Reddit, I've seen mods arbitrarily delete opinions they disliked countless times, and to a lesser extent I've seen mods delete comments and ban users because the moderator made wild assumptions. I'm not trying to make a blanket statement about mods, they're all different people - but I believe the community as a whole would be better off with mandatory transparency.

Angry and hostile people are unfortunately going to be angry and hostile regardless. 

> Even if there is a reason, do you think the subreddit would be better off when mods have to spend their time constantly relitigating the same thing all the time over and over again with hundreds of people?

If this was done for every subreddit I dont think your scenario would happen. If mandatory transparency became a thing, I dont think it should be retro-active.

> They remove holocaust denial related posts.

While I'm disgusted by holocaust denial (I'm Jewish), I purchased a copy of Mein Kampf off of Amazon because I wanted to hear what Hitler had to say for himself, I'm glad Amazon doesn't remove books they find offensive. 

If someone edits a wikipedia article to fill it with hate and vitriol, people can still see the revision if they want to see why it was removed from the article.

> Some were VERY visible intentionally, going to great lengths to explain everything. Others, who modded similar posts/comments in the same way, were less visible, sending PMs at best to people. The former always burn out

So it sounds like there was no accepted moderation method. If every deleted comment was replaced with a link to a ""comment graveyard"" it could serve as some great examples as what not to post, and maybe mods could have some subreddit-specific dropdown boxes for quickly labeling why the comment was bad.

Other mod tools would need to be made, but I still think the benefits outweigh the costs for a community. ",False,False,False,4953,9273,1456155452.0,False,False

Would it surprise you that when a post we remove is publicly shared in various anti-mod subs that means we get flooded with outrage from people who aren't even active in our sub.  Why would this be different?

What's the difference?  If it's a problem that people woudl have to constantly relitigate things forever, does it matter if they're relitigating things done a day before transparency or a day after?

Regarding /r/history, do you oppose them removing this in a less-than-transparent way?  Do you think that sub is better for it or worse because those removals don't come with very visible ""we remove holocaust denial posts""?

> So it sounds like there was no accepted moderation method.

Yeah, because we're not a company, or a government.  We have rules but we're flexible enough to know that not everyone is the same or can be most useful to ELI5 by acting exactly the same.I don't see ELI5 being worse by someone choosing to remove comments with less publicity, so if they want to do that I'm fine with it.

I just don't see the benefit, what exactly is the benefit besides attaining an ideal of transparency?  Would you be satisified just knowing who removed what?

The post itself was a screenshot of a tweet from CBS saying that the Statue of Liberty was supposed to be a Muslim woman. I researched that claim and found that the original Statue of Liberty was planned for the Suez Canal and was supposed to be a Muslim woman. Once it became the ""Statue of Liberty"" and was being planned for New York, it was not based off of a Muslim woman. It was kind of offensive to me that a media outlet would try to change history to fit a political agenda. I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm anti-changing history.

Absolutely. Except you can't have honest discussions with those who argue in bad faith. Which was pretty much the point of my previous post, by the way.

I find it very hard to believe that Reddit will remove profiles (among other features, but namely profiles) once they've been implemented--even if they receive negative feedback. The feedback collected thus far has been overwhelmingly negative, and yet Reddit seems to have doubled down on the idea. To be blut, what gives?

The response to this seems to be ""Don't worry, you'll like it once its done"", and that's a bit concerning if it represents the company's decision making process. You might as well say, ""We're going to make major changes wether you want them or not, but your feedback can help us make these changes as painless as possible"". This is not how to constructively use feedback.

What is driving these more controversial changes in the first place? Clearly they were not asked for, and have in fact been heavily criticized. Is Reddit the company the only one actually invested or interested in these ideas at all? Because a very small minority of users seem to be supporting this (I would assume at least, to be honest I actually have yet to see anyone happy about the idea of profiles...). Is that what we can expect from Reddit in the future? Company always trumps unanimous user base? I don't mean to be too outlandish, but that seems to describe the current profile situation fairly literally.

Further, why are you jumping straight to ""You'll like this feature""?. Why not start with, ""Do you want this feature?"". Or even better, ""Are there features you want?"". Because people like Reddit. For the most part, they don't want it to change. It seems counterintuitive to assume they want change, and what changes they want.

I ask because there are many subreddits created by spammers to post their own links. One example (of many): https://www.reddit.com/r/UFC214Livetv/

***

A different question about the front page algorithm and moderator abuse.

As I understand it, the front page algorithm is designed to keep subreddits from dominating the front page. The more posts a sub has on r/all/hot, the more difficult it is to get a new post there.

However, moderators have found a way around that. By removing other posts their sub has in r/all, they can very quickly promote a new post to the top of reddit.

You can see an example of this by looking at the moderator logs of r/evilbuildings and compare to the `created` timestamps of the sub's top posts.

Is this seen as abuse by Reddit?

Many of us fell in love with Reddit primarily because it was global. It didn't matter if you were in India (like me), or France, or Korea, you saw what was going on in the world. The problem that many of us predict is that we will see Reddit become just another Facebook, with all new users succumbing to the ecosystem.

The key ideal of Reddit is that it helped expand the minds of many who came here. We all changed our opinions as we interacted with people throughout the globe, and expanded our horizons into things we normally would. 

I'll be honest /u/spez. Many of us core users are afraid that new features like removing CSS, Reddit profiles, and geo specific frontpages will keep users firmly limited to their own ideas and thought processes, and change the uniqueness of each community. I was ambivalent to the first 2 changes, but this is one where I'm legitimately concerned.

Also, there's the problem of new users being turned off by the echo chamber. I for example, rarely visit /r/india, despite being an Indian living in India. Will I be forced to see political posts and the general flustercuck of my region? Because if that happens, I'd rather just switch to Facebook.

This means you stopped dealing with spam bots since you completely gave up on dealing with spam lately. >_>

Otherwise, can you at least revert the reporting system to be more *streamlined*? The current system pretty much encourages people to not give better reports, or to ignore users or un-subscribe users. I don't want people constantly ignoring each other. If they are not seeing the bad users, they're being reported less which means we mods don't see them as much. We want to stop the rule breaking, not hide it behind an ignore wall.

I realize a certain subreddit abused stickys/self posts to cheat the /r/all algorithm during the election, but I would suggest that the algorithm is now broken in the other direction if a post with 55k net upvotes, such as the one from earlier about a moderator sadly passing away, is ranked lower than some 5 hour old posts with 11k upvotes.

I understand if some tweaking is necessary, but Reddit is fine as it is. And since other similar inquiries are still going unanswered, I'll ask again: **why profile pages?** This is the most disappointing development plan I've heard. 

WTF do you guys want to be Facetwitgram for? We're here specifically to get away from that self-centric 'hey-everybody-look-at-me' crap. Currently the only place that is welcome on reddit is in r/AMA.

I've always loved reddit because it isn't about who or where you are. It's entirely about what you post and what you say. You can make a comment and get a reply from a housewife in Spain or a crackhead in Detroit or a professor of astronomy or a priest or a cop or a 16-yr-old high school student... it is the ultimate melting pot where all opinions are presented side by side and given an equal chance to be heard regardless of who the person giving them is. Channeling people into profile pages will ruin that conversational melting pot forever. 

And changing content based upon a user's region is really a massive disaster IMO. I want reddit to be an unfiltered international discussion place to make snarky comments about Putin and have Russian folks reply. I want to hear opinions about how ass-backwards the US health care system is from the rest of the world, which has managed to avoid the greedy profiteering that we embrace.

What is Reddit doing to prevent content theft and freebooting? Content is the lifeblood of Reddit, and right now there's no incentive to properly source it. And often times there are consequences for the people who *do* care enough to source it, because they source it a lot.

Reddit has a long history with rehosting content (mostly through Imgur), even though it was designed for link aggregation. While there are rules in place telling users they can't post new, original content in quantities over 10% of their total posts (or in some cases, just OC they find from the same sources), there are no consequences for those taking them or reuploading them. Entire videos get turned into gifs and top default subs like /r/funny, while independent filmmakers struggle to make their Youtube channel profitable. Users drill it into other users that rehosting is better for the creators because it prevents the Reddit hug-of-death.

In the past year I've had plenty of my own comics rehosted on Imgur and now Reddit's own hosting system. Users tell me I should be thankful for the exposure. People ask why you don't just submit it yourself if you're worried about proper credit. (It's against the rules.) If you submit it yourself, people say ""If it's popular enough, other people will find it and submit it.""

Admins say they don't write the rules, they let subreddits govern themselves.

Moderators say they don't write the global rules, it's on the admins.

Users don't care either way, they just want new content in the easiest way possible.

Meanwhile, certain power users scrape content from one subreddit and dump it into other, more popular subreddits for easy karma farming.

Content creators deserve support, without them Reddit wouldn't *have* content, and most of them are independent artists, photographers and filmmakers who *don't* rounds of investing and funding.",False,False,1501655030.0,97025,49100,1306971873.0,False,False

I made an [impassioned plea](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6pi0kk/improving_search/dkrm7t9/?context=3) to a different admin, but it felt as if it were ignored.

I was thinking about it and I'm curious if a lot more people wouldn't give Reddit gold away if it costs less to give to others than yourself. I'm not sure what the stats are, as in what portion of people buy gold, what portion give it away, what portion only buy for themselves, etc. But I personally feel like adding some more mechanics to this concept could have potential to make some good cash. 

I know people could game it a little, buy themselves cheaper  gold for example. But if everyone did that once.. could you complain? It has the potential though to get people who can't justify the cost to enjoy the fun of giving it away. 

Maybe having something like ""loot crates"" as a second item to give people using credits who already have a lot of gold like me. It could be a little crate next to the gold symbol and maybe they can open it for some special ""abilities"" to trigger on that post such as changing the appearance of their post in a small way (probably less viable given mobile effort). But novelty items that people could show off in one way or another, trading cards of memes with various ""quality"" legendary, epic etc. a vast majority of Reddit generation would probably find it as a fun thing to do on the side. 

As someone who's very much against invasive marketing tactics, amplified in a place like Reddit where many people communicate on very personal topics under the notion of anonymity I would love more emphasis on gold. Ads may be the normal way, but I was so disgusted when I saw an Amazon ad showing items I've recently placed in my wishlist. For many reasons, but primarily it means some how, some way an API exists for them. This API is made available to other partners, with he ever growing list of data dumps it's just a matter of time before a large portion of email addresses are dumped out from ""anonymous"" Reddit users and it could have devastating consequences.

The user could also select a default country for popular content o something like that!
The web redesing sounds good tho :D, i mean, the page is ok right now but it would be great a more moder style maintaining the original format. I always strugle to adapt to new formats in web pages, programs, etc. xD

So, basically, our program has agreements with all these social media sites in most cases - even Reddit - to integrate their site into our program for ease of communication. 

So you get on Instagram and send a photo of some PR disaster to my company and demand answers. Or maybe you just have questions about a new product you bought from us, or a service we provide. Well, we get your information that would be on file with our company - account numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, etc - and add it to a profile *about you* in our little social media platform aggregator deal. We even add your Instagram handle to it so when you message us next time, we can see what we did.

Well one day you contact us from Twitter, then Facebook, then your Reddit account...it's all good in the hood. We got all your little usernames and handles from each platform right there with your account information in our little program. 

I've seen a married man with nice public Twitter profile and him with his family as the cover photo forget he messaged us 5 years ago from his gay hookup Twitter profile that his family probably knows nothing of. It's all linked and I can look up your account and get your personal emails, phone number, address, etc. I would never do that, of course, but a hacker might. Wouldn't it be nice to hack a company's social media program and find all data on a social media username that pissed you off in that program? 

Has any company you've ever reached out to and provided personal information to through social media asked your permission to record and store this information? I bet not.

[Your team poorly responded to this by outright lying when they said posts were removed due to rule-breaking, brigading, and hate speech.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nsiw1/state_of_the_subreddit_and_the_orlando_shooting/) We were assured that steps would be taken to make sure it never happened again.......but it is still happening: 

Here is a user who was upvoted in a /r/worldnews thread titled [""Swedish Embassy offers to 'inform' Donald Trump on country's immigration and integration policy""](https://i.redd.it/c7a4l090c1hy.png), but had his comment removed by a /r/worldnews mod for ""Hate speech"", even though his post was well sourced claiming actual statistics. You can see that he was also banned from the subreddit for it.

Need more examples? How about when a [Swedish refugee centre worker was killed in a stabbing](https://archive.is/GjUxt), and the entire thread was deleted, but not before being marked as ""Not Appropriate Subreddit"". Please, explain to me how a story about a Swedish woman being stabbed by a resident of a refugee centre isn't world news? [It was also removed from](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42mh69/swedish_refugee_centre_worker_dead_in_stabbing/) /r/Europe for being ""off-topic"".

This is why /r/uncensorednews saw a massive boost of 65,000 subscribers, and /r/news saw a massive reduction of 78,836 subscribers after the terrorist attack in Orlando. The_Donald alone saw a boost of 11,712 subscribers in one day alone, because due to massive censorship taking place, the only place anyone could get actual information on the Orlando shooting on Reddit was T_D and uncensorednews. People obviously don't like it when their news is censored. (Who would of thought?)

This is blatant censorship taking place underneath your command. Either you don't pay attention, you don't give a fuck, or you know about this and refuse to do anything about it, allowing censorship. It's one of the three, spez. I already know what the answer is, so I will just say this, as an advocate of free speech, Aaron Swartz would be disgusted by your behavior.

And yet, you removed one of the primary methods of reporting spam, using ModTools to report directly to /r/spam with a single click. Now we have to manually write and send a PM to an admin address, which may or may not ever read the report, and almost never responds. 

This is a huge step backwards. You guys promised Moderators would have a new set of tools to deploy against spammers and abusers. How long ago was that? A year? More? We still don't have the promised tools, and we lost a primary tool. Yes, a big step backwards.

We are also completely defenseless against repeat abusers who create new accounts over and over, and even buy aged accounts from spammers who created thousands of accounts and sat on them, so they could not be filtered like zero-day accounts.

You are too focused on the superficial design of the site, and insufficiently focused on supporting the moderators who work so hard to stop abuse. And what has Reddit ever done for me?

I don't see that happening without revamping how reddit retains and oversees moderation on its many subreddits. There's no appeals process or any kind of feedback mechanism, nor any transparency in who/what/where/when/why moderator actions are being taken, nor any process to remove them.


It has a serious chilling effect on minority views and has greatly discouraged participation and use of reddit as a public forum by many, many groups. If you want to hit a billion users, you need a community framework, more transparency, and establishing a punitive system for removing moderators who abuse the community's trust. As I understand it, you ran into a problem with community trust as an administrator -- so I believe you of all people should understand the importance of making these changes. 


This idea of subreddits being wholly owned by the moderators who are utterly immune to any community action has seriously limited your website's ability to compete. It's led to a situation not unlike what happened when ICANN took over the domain name system: The most popular and valuable names were given to those whose only virtue was either being the first, or having enough money and influence to take it by force. 


As it has been said many times in business, ""Evolve or die."" What got you this far won't take you across that finish line -- it's a deceptive and alluring idea to believe it can. Every business goes through varying stages of growth and each requires different leadership styles and goals as it does. A CEO that's great at keeping a startup going won't have the right skillset or mindset to manage a mature multinational. A CEO called in as a specialist to right a sinking ship with cost overruns and structural problems isn't the kind of person you'll need to grow the business after salvaging it to start operating at a profit again.

Advertising is very seldom even about the product, and more often subsists of attempts at emotional manipulation. When I see this crap: I boycott for life, no exceptions. It is abhorrent and abusive behavior for a company to engage in. Besides, don't try to pretend this costs the company themselves anything. They are reimbursed for this expense. Do you not think marketing budget factors into product cost? What it ultimately does is drive up the cost of space they occupy, reducing incentive for meaningful content to be placed in such space.

I stopped drinking alcohol when I realized the majority of it's advertising was geared towards attempting to make the viewer feel like they are less without it. The companies distort the reality of their products and turn that into subtle emotional manipulation which is intended to facilitate a ""need"" for said product. I went from not caring about advertising to thinking they are monsters over the span of a few marketing courses. I realized the product was irrelevant, and it was a game of culture.

Not every company does this, but a great many do. There's too many important things going on in the world. Any company still having at playing this petty and wasteful game deserves nothing but atrophy. Because there are plenty of companies who never advertise, and seem to be doing just fine without feeling the need to invade the head-space of entire demographics. 

Couple this with the way invasion of privacy is being justified for the purposes of targeted advertising. . . It should be no surprise why this has become my stance. If I am targeted by an ad: I will never buy it specifically because I was targeted by it. Down the path we're on lay a disgusting and childish future where stupidity becomes a systemic virtue.

Until we have verifiable proof of collusion, I personally think it's irresponsible for people to push the idea it is true. 

This isn't how our justice system is supposed to work. Innocent until proven guilty. Yet you want to assume guilt until proven innocent (Wanting proof of a negative claim) 

Pizza gate is false, Seth Rich wasnt assassinated by the DNC,  so too is this Russian collusion theory false. Unless evidence comes forth.

I won't defend the anti semeticism and anti Muslim rhetoric that gets spouted in the sub. An outright ban I think would be a bit excessive. Instead I think an change of policy threatening to mods of the sub to keep things clean under threat of banning. 

At least that is my personal opinion.

Edit: Honestly whether or not the Russian collusion is true or not I honestly think pushing it is dangerous.
Rather than the Democratic party thinking to themselves that they lost due to corruption within the party allowing them to collude with the MSN to push an unlikable candidate. In addition to a platform that doesn't speak to many Americans, including those in the rust belt. It allows them to brush it all off as Russia's fault. 

It's Russia's fault for supposedly hacking the DNC servers (An unverified claim) and revealing their corruption? 
It's Russia's fault for using Twitter bots to push articles and conspiracy theories critical of Hillary?
And supposedly in coordination with the Trump campaign.

The Democrats need to self reflect. Which cannot happen while this narrative is being pushed.

If you don't think the site was originally founded as a forum for free speech(since the addition of comments) go read Ohanians interview from 2012. When asked what the founding fathers would think of Reddit, he replied 

""A bastion of free speech on the world wide web? I bet they would like it.""

In 2014 Yishan Wong again says that they will not force people on reddit to ""do the right thing"" after receiving criticism for shutting down The Fappening(a decision I agree with, free speech doesn't include spreading naked pictures of random people that were only made public by hackers). He said:

""We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you — the user — has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. When you know something is right, you should choose to do it. But as much as possible, we will not force you to do it.""

In July 2011 Reddit GM Erik Martin was asked ""What do you think of subreddits such as r/jailbait and r/picsofdeadkids?"" to which he replied:

""What if the name of the subreddit was /r/autopsyphotos or /r/doyoureallywanttogointocriminalforensics and they were sincere in their discussion of these images? Would some of that 98 percent now be ok with it? I would bet at least some would. What if it wasn't kids but adults? Or historical autopsy photos only? The point is I don't want to be the one making those decisions for anyone but myself, and it's not the business Reddit is in. We're a free speech site with very few exceptions (mostly personal info) and having to stomach occasional troll reddit like picsofdeadkids or morally questionable reddits like jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this.""

*But*, as you probably know since you're going around telling people ""find another forum""(I'm sure you've done loads of research on this for yourself!) Reddit didn't even originally have a section for comments, so free speech wasn't originally the plan. Over time it grew into that, and in 2008 user created subs were allowed when Reddit claimed they were ""Just taking themselves out of the equation.""

Since the inclusion of a comment section Reddit grew into a free speech platform. Former GM's and CEO's have defended this time and time again, with few exceptions. They *did* have a line drawn in the sand, but it was to protect users personal information from being posted, and that didn't even really start until 2011 when  Kristine Fasnacht says the site is cracking down hard on posting information that could lead to harassment.

Your idea that this ""is a private website"" and that nobody is ""entitled to post lies and hate here"" wasn't *really* started until Ellen Pao took over. In June 2015 on NPR Pao said:

""Somebody expressing ideas that aren't consistent with everybody's views is something that we encourage. There are certain posts that do make people feel unsafe, that people feel threatened or they feel that their family or friends or people near them are going to be unsafe, and those are the specific things that we are focused on today.

It's not our site's goal to be a completely free speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.""

After Pao was fired Yishan Wong changed his tune and said:

""The free speech policy was something I formalized because it seemed like the wiser course at the time. It's worth stating that in that era, we were talking about whether it was ok for people to post creepy pictures of women taken legally in public. That's shitty, but it's a far cry from the extremes of hate that some parts of the site host today.""

So free speech on Reddit has always been somewhat hazy. There is no doubt that people used to be able to post much more bizarre and hateful things here, and I can't speak to whether it's right or wrong. What I can say is that on this site, we are less free to say what we want than we were even 3 years ago. I personally post as many racist and hateful comments as I want to, which is none. The part of the community that wants to post those things have moved to places like Voat.

In the absence of regulation, or at least bad regulation, the telcom market should become more saturated and more competitive over time.  ISPs have no real incentive to limit the range of content available to their subscribers, only data rates, even in the absence of competition.  Media companies like HBO would salivate at the prospect of providing a service where they didn't have to put up money to develop content they provided to their subscribers.  ISPs are more likely to fear the prospect of sites like Reddit charging *them* for access before passing the costs on to their clients.

Ultimately though, it isn't important what private groups do on the internet.  It will adapt, new protocols will develop and it will route around damage or censorship, which are the same thing.  What is a problem is the creation of a new mechanisms for government and political interests to pick winners and losers in that space.  Regulatory capture from vested interests will likely make development of the internet a more moribund process.  Moreover, they may even seek to utilize powers granted to them to limit whatever they perceive as damaging to interested actors.  The Supreme Court is likely to recognize any assumed powers as constitutional, so the only way to limit them is at the ballot.

As to fixing them, that'll require an overhaul of how content is sorted and presented. Longer comments tend to be higher quality and rating everything with a default point score of 1 means they're very likely to get buried. ""The early bird gets the karma"", and the algorithm strongly reinforces that. Longer posts should be initially scored higher, even transiently, to allow them to be seen and voted on. As well, voting shouldn't change the sorting until a large enough number of votes have been cast to be representative: I've seen a lot of good comments downvoted to 0 or -1 and they're just gone for good then because someone disagreed. Let enough votes be tallied before applying a resort to ensure it's a fair representation of what many people think, not just a couple who love to use it as a disagree button. 


As well, Reddit needs to lean on heuristics for initial display of new comments; We already know certain words and phrases (""fuck you!"") are strong indicators of low quality. We can use votes on other content within that subreddit/community to correlate words and phrases which tend to rank highly, and adjust initial scores accordingly. Is it game-able? Sure. But the system already is anyway, so we might as well bias it in a direction that's actually useful.


There is zero reward to anyone who writes a good comment, especially a top level one, after the first 50 or so. It's altogether too easy to threadjack the top level comment(s) to shitpost and get tons of upvotes, which in turn kill any opportunity for more high quality comments to lead off from that one... anyone who wants to take the time to write a good comment and get it noticed needs to post it at about the right time, and high enough in the sort someone will see it and start the upvote train. If you want people to even bother... they need a reward of some kind and the system as it works now is total garbage at fostering that.

Not always. It takes time to get these things right, which is why we're moving slowly. We received a lot of feedback, some of which was actionable (e.g. more privacy controls), some of which isn't useful (e.g. you're turning in Facebook!).

The reality is the feature isn't yet cohesive, so much of the user feedback lacks context.

One of the important things we have to do is balance many kinds of feedback, to name a few, 1) Feedback from passionate users like yourself in the form of comments on announcements, beta user feedback, etc. 2) Feedback from moderators, who help us keep the site running and are our community leaders, 3) Feedback from a growing and silent majority of users who lurk and browse the site, and communicate less explicitly, for example via their behavior on our products or via surveys where we reach out to them and hear from them directly, 4) Feedback from people who we don't count among our users yet, but whom we could serve well, like members of smaller communities on other parts of the web. 

So when you mention features that ""no one wants... as far as [you've] seen,""  it is important to keep in mind there are many kinds of feedback that not every one on the site can see, and we must take all of it into account.

Because it would force original content creators to submit only their ""good"" stuff if they're limited to how much they could post. Sure, it's a bit of work on their part, but why *shouldn't* they be forced to only submit their good stuff instead of shotgunning everything they've ever created? It makes them be more choosy in when & how to submit stuff. I want there to be a barrier to entry opposed to trying to hold back a flood of spam with a couple bags of sand.

And it's also an objective number rather than a subjective ""feeling"". *Consistency* is the name of the game and (if you'll allow me to be blunt) it's a fucking travesty that you (and the rest of your admin team) haven't come to understand this yet. When you're dealing with tens, nay, hundreds of millions of users, being consistent is of the utmost importance. I learned this the hard way through years of moderating some of reddit's biggest subreddits. It horrifying that reddit's CEO doesn't yet understand the importance of consistency. Which leads me to my following revelation:

I'm not really sure you understood the rule in the first place if this is your opinion. I get the feeling every day, every announcement you make that you're getting more and more out of touch. I don't say that lightly, either. What is important for you and your admin team is not on the same page as what is important for us mods and its users. We're working off two different playbooks while you pretend they're one in the same. The scary thing is I don't think you're pretending, I think you actually believe you're not out of touch, and that everything you do is in our best interests. 

If you ever want to know if you're truly and honestly out of touch; put your admin duties on hold, create a new account without access to your admin tools and ask me to make you a moderator in TIL and Videos for several weeks. Put in a good 2-4 weeks worth of moderating without accessing your admin account. Be a moderator for a few weeks at minimum. Get in the trenches as it were, and test yourself. :) 

I have a feeling you'll be ramming your head into a wall in short order like the rest of us. Though it's possible you'll cheat, and you'll use your admin tools to discover and identify spammers, or you'll call up one of the admins and have them 'expedite' a request for you. Don't cheat if you're going to do it, fully put yourself in our shoes and commit to it.

There is exactly one line in the TOS that could be interpreted this way. There are also a dozen more plausible ways you could interpret that line. Given that Reddit has taken no action, they must not agree with your interpretation.

What if this answer is itself is the way it is due to it simply being handed down from the previous generation? Does that make sense? What if ""that's the way it is"" wasn't the way it was?

I believe we've been taught not to try to change anything by previous generations. I think this is because they feel like they failed, but I believe few of them really ever tried in earnest either. Because the few who had were generally successful, and the message they offered generally had themes in direction opposition to ""that's the way it is"". 

Like MLK's ""I have a dream"". I think the idea is to see what could be, and allow that to carry you the rest of the way. ""that's the way it is"" is always looking behind us, committing us to repeat the same in the future. To accept such is vice. It relieves one of their imperative to change the situation for the better.

Gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder (GID) is the dysphoria (distress) a person experiences as a result of the sex and gender they were assigned at birth. In these cases, the assigned sex and gender do not match the person's gender identity, and the person is transgender. There is evidence suggesting that twins who identify with a gender different from their assigned sex may do so not only due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics or exposure to hormones before birth.

Estimated rates of those with a transgender identity range from a lower bound of 1:2000 (or about 0.05%) in the Netherlands and Belgium to 0.5% of Massachusetts adults to 1.2% of New Zealand high-school students.

2. The ""pretty"" girl is barely in the photo and isn't facing the camera, so you don't even know what she looks like.

I have multiple family photos from when I was a child in which Coke bottles are clearly visible, because my father loved Coke.

If there's a group picture and we're drinking at a bonfire, nobody stops to go ""oh wait let's flip the bottles so that no brands are visible"", because that's dumb.

The only place I've ever seen people concerned with this hysteria over visible logos or brand names is reddit.  Nobody else gives a shit, and there will always be pictures and videos or descriptions that have brands or logos or names or companies involved simply because that's what people do!

No, not really.  If you take a look at the front page from [exactly three years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20140731075813/reddit.com/r/all), you'll notice that:

The top post is a sloth picture, which reddit still obsesses over (I see that damn sloth astronaut picture once a week)

The second post is the same repeated TIL about Danny Trejo 

The third post is from r/circlejerk over fucking jackdaws

The fourth post mentions celebrities and has THE AVENGERS in all caps, a movie series reddit still obsesses over

The fifth post is a picture of Japan, v v v pretty

And the sixth post specifically mentions a product by name, Animal Crossing

Literally all of the top six posts (I'm far too lazy to keep going) would fit in reddit today with virtually no change.  Hell, look at r/all right now and you'll see the top post being a Hearthstone gaming post (oh no, IT'S ADVERTISING!!1), a gif about bath bombs, a Star Wars behind the scenes post joking about the prequels, a post about Russian meddling in the elections, a joke post about shitty school writing, and a family picture with no brands in it.  Just below it are Earth Porn and another gaming post and a TIL post.

Three years ago or today, reddit still circlejerks over pretty pictures, video games, movies, redundant TIL posts.

>The Rick and Morty thing was serendipitious, maybe, but to have that damn szechuan sauce post hit r/all every day for a week...

The Rick and Morty fanbase is obsessive and obnoxious.  As funny as the show is, the fanbase is massive and unrelenting in how it shoves the subject matter in reddit's face 24/7.  r/programminghumor has the same subject matter jerks for weeks, r/highqualitygifs have had the same meta bullshit going on for months, r/TIL still posts the same shit over and over, etc - hell, do you remember when everyone was worked up into an unholy hellish fury over Ellen Pao?  That was weeks of degeneracy over some bullshit that nobody even cared about a day after it ended.  It was unrelenting and made major news.

**Issue 1**

Do Not Track is not a useful thing.  See [this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/126705/why-enabling-do-not-track-doesnt-stop-you-from-being-tracked/) from *2012* that talks about how websites just ignore it.  If you set up Do Not Track in your browser, Reddit might listen nicely, but many other websites don't.  However, there's a nonzero amount of developmental work that goes into following Do Not Track.  Every update you make that involves that kind of thing has to figure out how to take it into account and have ways to implement it.  As reddit continues to make changes and update things, they have to keep this legacy code alive.  This takes developmental resources for only limited gain.  Those resources could be spent on a better system that gives you granular control and better feedback about the data they're collecting instead of an abandoned platform that you as a user have no way of knowing whether it's working or not.

**Issue 2**

The current announcement refers to the ability to opt-out instead of the ability to opt-in.  This is a pain in the ass, but remember that many web browsers have Do Not Track as an opt-in behavior too.  

-----------

For those two issues to be related, you have to believe that reddit said to themselves ""We'd really like to track more people, but too many people have Do Not Track enabled on their browsers.  If we eliminate Do Not Track and replace it with our own system, maybe a bunch of them will forget to opt in to our own system and we'll get to track more people.""

The ONLY theory I can come up with that is even a little bit reasonable is that he works for McDonalds as a web developer, and he got caught redditing on the job so they made him post something for them.  They might also be a little upset that he apparently did a little moonlighting for [modding Cookie Clicker](https://www.reddit.com/r/CookieClicker/comments/1y2vkz/cookiemaster_v1141_critical_bug_fix_released/) 3 years ago.

But then again, maybe he offers native advertising services independently - he did make another McDonalds [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/6htgny/man_brings_his_own_bottle_of_mayonnaise_to/) a month ago in /r/unitedkingdom about someone bringing their own bottle of mayo into the store.  But as far as I can tell, those are the only /r/hailcorporate posts he has made - the vast majority of everything he has posted has been technology related.  I personally find it more likely that him making a couple of McDonalds related comments and posts in the past month amongst a sea of techonology and development related posts is purely coincidence and not nefarious.",False,False,False,96118,741,1369177677.0,False,False

That's the problem with native advertising. That said, that image is *very* staged.

>The number of spiteful comments attacking the OP for posting a picture on a website is disgusting, and I guarantee the OP got at least one PM with a death threat, if not more.

This is why pseudonymity is important, and so is OPSEC when it comes to revealing details about yourself. Accounts are disposable, they don't know who you are, and you shouldn't take stuff on the internet personally. If that were happening to OP (and assuming he *isn't* connected to McDonald's in some form), best thing to do is just delete the account. All you lose is karma, and karma is worthless. It's not like he's being torn into about a post where he shared private, intimate things with personal attacks, and even if he was, you can delete and start fresh at any time. It's a picture of a guy wearing a VR headset with a bunch of McDonald's product suspiciously placed in the picture, and everyone is accusing him of working for McDonald's corporate.

There's really no way to know without going server side (if even that, can't quite remember) that it wasn't just done by the original dude. I think it was something on T_D like ""fuck spez"" editted to ""I love spez"". Turns out when they rehired him they basically left all his permissions in place like before (when he did require them for his work).

There's several things from with this. First, dev controls like that are only ever on *needed* basis. Spez' function at the time, and still, did and does not need dev controls. This is very basic website management, a goddamn startup can tell you this. Unless your job description specifically entails needing this level of access, you shouldn't ever have it.

Second, legal implications. Reddit comments and posts have been used in legal cases. Now Reddit staff have shown not just capability, but also willingness to just maliciously edit comments. I killed 700 people on a dare. Did I type that or did /u/spez?

Culminating during the Stalin era, it still existed during the ""Khrushchev Thaw"", followed by increased persecution of Soviet dissidents during the Brezhnev stagnation, and didn't cease to exist during Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika. Its heritage still influences the life of modern Russia and other former Soviet states.

> that's actually the point of viral advertising. To make it cool enough that their brand becomes something people want to share on their own

the point of viral advertising is to make stuff that looks like it's being generated by normal users but is actually marketing material specifically crafted to push brand awareness. 

Just look at reddit, there are websites where you can buy 'aged' accounts so you look like a genuine user when you post your viral content, if it's happening here it's happening on every other social platform.

Look at twitter. Then look at the news and see who's tweets get discussed the most.

Having a reddit user, with a massive followers count, will have their posts upvoted unproportionally to the quality of their content.

It'll be the garbagification of the site.

Just because you give people some amount of power doesn't mean they can do whatever they want with it.  This is true of _all_ forms of power.  They can all be abused, and they shouldn't be.  

Look, even reddit's content policy (#1, no less) states:

> ""Reddit is a platform for communities to discuss, connect, and share *in an open environment*""

So it could even be argued that by not allowing an open environment they are breaking reddit policy.  But, at the very least, this proves that the moderation style you're supporting is against the intent of reddit. And, again, since they make no efforts to segment reddit it shows this behavior is against the structure of the site as well.  

Regardless, my whole problem is that I see this as a bad direction for the site.  

1. it has undermined the credibility of the site.   It used to be that comments were somewhat trustworthy to determine if something was bullshit or not. But not anymore. Not in politics/news at least. If anything reddit has become a prime source for ""fake news"" because of this moderation style. People can, and do, post complete bullshit, and not a comment in sight showing that/why it is bullshit. That's not good..

2. it drives division and extremism.  Most people are fairly level headed and neutral.  But you're not allowed to be in this current environment. Not only must you choose sides, and adhere to the circlejerk, but the mods are effectively choosing sides for you.  Forcing you into it.  And you can see it first hand - over the last year there's been a _huge_ spike in extremism on reddit.  Communism, anarchism, etc has suddenly become popular on the site. And being anywhere in the middle subjects you to attack from both sides. (which I've felt first hand). 

3. It creates a perfect environment for literal paid shilling.  I don't know for certain whether any of these subs are wholly organic or being manipulated, but it doesn't really matter since they could be taken over by a PR firm and we wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  And I think (hope) both of us agree that's definitely _not_ the purpose of reddit.  But, as it stands, if we continue to allow this direction you can be guaranteed that it will become the purpose.

I don't think downvotes are being counted at all in the total, that, or their value is significantly diminished. According to /u/pinkiedash417, you'd need about 500,000 votes on each side to get to a point where one side is up 21k and there's a 50% like ratio. Yet the comment pointing out that it's an ad is at about 16k upvotes. Assuming that everyone that upvoted that comment downvoted the OP (reasonably fair given that if you think it's an ad, you should downvote it for spam), that already gets you most of the way towards 21k total upvotes and a 50% like ratio. And a lot of people don't read all the comments or even necessarily upvote there. The fact that the post is an ad became somewhat viral, as I saw it on multiple subs, including /r/bestof. And with the way reddit is, I could legitimately see 500,000 people downvoting that post (even though that seems rather extreme), but I honestly can't see another 500,000 + margin upvoting it. It just doesn't add up. That vote count doesn't seem accurate at all, though I think the ratio might be, since it's generally hard to get a viral post down to 0, and I do think there is some level of botting used by McDonald's. In that bestof thread, I saw somebody go to -15 for suggesting that marketers buy existing Reddit accounts, even though this is a known phenomenon (and if you Google reddit accounts for sale, you will find them).

I think this is why they have been vague on vote numbers for so long, and why (?|?) happened, they want the ability to manipulate them or apply algorithms to them to make the site look better for advertisers and more mainstream audiences. Though people assume that the vote counts are based on the number of upvotes - downvotes, and when they announced that they were removing the cap on total upvotes instead of averaging, they reinforced this perception.

Trump has completed a laundry list of things that you would never bother to read, but are all sourced on whitehouse.gov. Like: unemployment at all time lows. Stock market at all time highs.

Received funding for the southern Border Wall. Many, many more.

Not every business owner is a big bad corporation. But when the left isnt short sighted, theyre lying to themselves with delusions of grandeur.

There are few on the left whom would work if they could choose to. Many more who wouldnt work with the same choice. The left fought for 15$ minimum wage, some states did it, those restaurants are closing, people lose jobs and businesses close. SMALL BUSINESSES.Though the left doesnt give a fuck until they cant get their gimmiedats.

The Right defunds those bloated government programs because they put States into debt so far that they couldnt start another retarded socialist project if they wanted to IE: California. If a person works hard, makes something of themselves, starts a business and is successful in that business, why should he give the money he worked hard to develop a business for away to people who didnt earn a thing involved with it? 

No thanks. On top of that, you say we and the right are death mongers, while the UK healthcare system just doomed a child to death, on the same type of social healthcare platform you want. Idiocy.

The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

Hold on! Alarm bells are going off. This is an immense presumption, that seemingly ignores the fact that Blacks and Latinos came out in unexpected droves to support Trump. We're just going to brush aside, religion, the economy, and foreign relations that were equally or more significant than what you're describing as overt, thinly-veiled racism? I'm of the opinion that humans are, by nature, tribal and social beings who are most comfortable around those that are similar to them. People are more than happy to self-segregate themselves and we ought to be wary to judge that as anything more than natural (eg. A large number of churches that teach essentially the same message are sharply drawn down racial lines, Prison segregation, cafeterias, on the looser end)


> White racists, Neo-Nazis, Religious Fundamentalists, Ethno-Nationalists of all stripes, those bigoted towards Muslims and/or Muslims, and/or all minorities. 'Idenitarians', etc, etc, etc.


White racists (not the Grandmas who aren't PC, but the people who chase minorities down in pickups and burn crosses) - a tiny insignificant demographic with a large portion that couldn't be bothered to vote in the first place. Same with neo-Nazis.


Religious fundamentalists - I thought this was the grouping for people we would consider 'horrible' on the level of the scum and dredges of society? Evangelicals/social conservatives belong in this group??


Ethno-nationalists - see above/we're talking a few thousand at most out of what, 300 million people? Their numbers drop to statistically insignificant when looking at eligible voters and their propensity to vote. 


Bigots - again, bigoted people are included in the worst people in society? Especially by today's standards, where a bigot is anyone who has the nerve to point out factual differences between people?


Identitarians - A little of pool A a little of pool B - more intellectually curious than dangerous and too few to matter.


In my humble opinion there are only three groups we need to look at to explain how Trump beat Hillary: 


1) White women - the 'pussy grabbing' stuff and a nonstop barrage of accusations of sexism had nearly all of the pollsters dead wrong about who this group would side with. 


2) Rust belt blue collar - I knew there was a good chance in Wisconsin, but Michigan and almost winning Minnesota completely blew me away. Even in Reagan's sweep, the one state he couldn't pull off was Minnesota. I appreciate your popular vote analysis but the popular vote is a negligible factor in American elections and this explosion in the rust belt is far more significant to the only deciding factor for who wins; the electoral college. Not sure if my stats are wrong or if yours are but I am seeing 65.9 million Obama votes in 2012 and 65.8 for Hillary in 2016, and with your 6% population increase since 2008, the difference becomes more significant. Of course, these numbers demonstrate nothing because the only path to the presidency is 270 electoral votes.


3) Perhaps the most important demographic that included many in the rust belt and is one of the most ignored statistics: Those people who voted for Obama twice and then pulled the lever for Trump. Your analysis speaks a lot about Republicans, a little about Democrats, but almost nothing about Independents/undecided. It is this demographic that I believe to be the best explanation for your alienated base argument. Is it more likely that the Republican apathy gap (which is more accurately described as voter apathy since Democrats weren't exactly thrilled either about holding their noses for Hillary, especially considering what happened to Sanders and the Bernie or Bust folks who felt that Trump was probably closer to Sanders than Hillary - at least Trump and Bernie agreed on trade, the TPP, foreign relations) was filled by, for all intents and purposes, the silent majority who didn't want to talk to anyone about politics, especially pollsters? Or is it more likely that it was the 10,000 or so actual deplorables we noted earlier?


> Republicans talk about the policy Border Security. Trump rants about the scourge of Mexican rapists.
Republicans talk about immigration policy and risks of terrorist attack. Trump rants about Muslims and declares this a Christian nation.
Republicans think being tough on crime is important. Trump reminiscences on stop and frisk.


Why are any of these concepts mutually exclusive? If you don't think Trump touched on policy, you probably didn't go on his website and read his extensive policy positions which certainly did not have the bombastic rhetoric of his firebrand campaign rallies.  He was actually rather succinct in many of his policy proposals and many of them were quite bi-partisan. Who thinks it's a bad idea to take big-money lobbying out of politics? Who would argue against term limits? The vast majority of anti-Trump people were in total agreement with his tax proposals when I actually showed them to them (taking out the complicated rules and simplifying things to the point where an individual can do their own taxes, 0% income tax on those who make less than $25,000 a year, eliminating burdensome regulations that choke small business but do virtually nothing to multi-nationals, etc.)


> Trump did not talk politics. Trump talked people


In my opinion he did both and like any good populist, yes, he talked in words everybody could understand. Let's not assume that you can just be a successful populist without the appropriate underlying strategy in place.  In that regard, he utilized a brilliant group of campaign managers that did just the right things at just the right times. (Lewandowski for shock and awe, making bold claims and bombastic rhetoric that got Trump's name plastered all over the media cycles - all press is good press. Manafort who wrangled the delegates and gave Trump the edge over fellow R candidates. And then going into the general, Bannon and Conway - the former to keep Trump on message (""Let Trump be Trump"") and the latter to soften him up for independents/undecided and make him a little more human.  


> Trump actually received fewer votes than Romney and McCain all the way back in 2012 and 2008 both who lost, which accounting for inflation is a big stonking deal for a winner of an election.


I'm seeing 59.9m for McCain, 56.1m for Romney, and 62.9m for Trump. Again, could be my fault, but why are our numbers so far off? Even with your 6% pop increase (which boils down to a significantly lower eligible voter increase) Trump still smoked Romney and, at worst, tied McCain.)


So now it's my turn to apologize for the lengthy response but until we can reconcile why we are getting such different numbers, I'm unfortunately not convinced at this point that the true 'deplorables' were statistically significant in determining the election results.

My proof was in the goddamn citation, but since you can't or don't want to look for it, here you go:

####**Trump claiming that black people are lazy, and that's their trait, full quote and source:**
>“Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”**[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html?_r=0)**

>""Trump eventually denied making those comments. But in 1997 in a Playboy interview, he conceded “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”**[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html?_r=1)**

I've been redditor since before subreddits existed, I also mod some fairly large subreddits. I can assure you that if anything, the marketing and astroturfing is being understated. I doubt the reddit admins themselves realize just how much of that goes on here, and the amount of content that reaches their front page which is not organic in nature. 

On facebook, twitter and even youtube, your reach as a marketer or propagandist is limited to your subscribers, followers, etc. You hope & pray it can ""sprawl"" across social media platforms, and that's ultimately your goal. But on reddit, you can achieve that sprawl much more quickly. 

You can reach reddit's front page in under an hour and in turn, reach millions, tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of eyes in under 24 hours. Given that reach, it's insane and naive to think that every online marketing agency in the world doesn't have a presence on reddit. Reddit is now the 4th largest website in the U.S (just checked, it dropped to 5th this month). That puts it ahead of websites like Netflix, Amazon, Wikipedia, Imgur, Linkedin, Tumblr, Ebay and Twitter (Amazon just swapped places with reddit and moved back into 4th).

For some reason, people seem to think it either can't happen on reddit, or they'd be smart enough or wise enough to spot it. I think that's why it isn't a popular sentiment; people just assume they'd spot and/or notice it. Unfortunately, most people aren't as smart as they think they are. Also, you have those very same marketers being regular redditors themselves, downvoting said complaints and acting as if such behavior could/would never occur here (job security). 

And it's not just marketing companies in the U.S, but all over the world. And not just companies, but also government entities looking to sway public opinion (the PRC loves to target /r/Worldnews for example), as well as political groups, ideological causes/issues, and essentially anyone with agenda, paid or otherwise. 

I've broken up some massive spam rings myself, I've seen every dirty tactic and trick in the book -- some so clever they're not even in the book yet.  You wouldn't believe the kinds of things people try, how convoluted and how much effort they put into their attempts. More often than not, I'm genuinely amazed at their ingenuity.

Neoliberalism (neo-liberalism) refers primarily to the 20th-century resurgence of 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire economic liberalism. These include extensive economic liberalization policies such as privatization, fiscal austerity, deregulation, unrestricted free trade, and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society. These market-based ideas and the policies they inspired constitute a paradigm shift away from the post-war Keynesian consensus which lasted from 1945 to 1980.

The term has been used in English since the start of the 20th century with different meanings, but became more prevalent in its current meaning in the 1970s and 1980s by scholars in a wide variety of social sciences, as well as being used by critics.

If Reddit is just in it for the money, then that's a complaint in itself. They have every right to do that, but it will cost them in overall quality, which is the point I'm making. Forced change does not equall improvement in quality, nor is it a necessity. Let's use Reddit itself as an example. The interface hasn't had a major change in six years, and they have grown exponentially! People like it! They stuck to the same winning formula, and the users responded to it.

User generated change absolutely can improve a website. Corprate assumptions on the other hand often do not. Remember myspace? And Digg? And YikYak? And AOL? They adapted into what thought users wanted, but put an underlying emphasis on user turnover. Look where that got them. There are of course examples of when it works, commercially at least, (Facebook, instagram, etc.) but even they have evolved into something completely ignorant of the fundamentals they were founded upon, and lost any sense of uniqueness. That's what many of the complaints here are about, users don't want Reddit to fall in that direction too.

On the other hand, look at 4chan. I'm not much of a 4chan fan myself, but look at their model. 4chan hasn't rolled out an update in...ever? And for that reason, they stayed relatively small and kept their same loyal users happy. These users here want Reddit to do the same. Update the smaller issues as they arise, sure, but don't go doing anything drastic just to attract new users.

Again, its Reddit's right as a company to be money hungry if they so choose. They might as well abandon this ""We're different from conventional social media!"" facade while they're at it though. If they want to make the best most high quility product they can make, they should listen to user feedback and not make decisions for them.

In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state.

Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism, anarchism (anarchist communism), and the political ideologies grouped around both. All these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism, that in this system, there are two major social classes: the working class—who must work to survive, and who make up the majority within society—and the capitalist class—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class, through private ownership of the means of production—and that conflict between these two classes will trigger a revolution. The revolution, in turn, will establish social ownership of the means of production, which is, according to this analysis, the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state.

Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism, anarchism (anarchist communism), and the political ideologies grouped around both. All these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism, that in this system, there are two major social classes: the working class—who must work to survive, and who make up the majority within society—and the capitalist class—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class, through private ownership of the means of production—and that conflict between these two classes will trigger a revolution. The revolution, in turn, will establish social ownership of the means of production, which is, according to this analysis, the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

One view is that a free market is a system in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority. Another view considers systems with significant market power, inequality of bargaining power, or information asymmetry to be less than free.

It is a result of recognizing a need, followed by the need being met. Some believe a free market contrasts with a regulated market, in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as tariffs used to restrict trade and protect the economy.

It is. Just look at my posts here. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/dkzfb5j/) is particularly indicative.

I edited it out because reddit has a braindead ""don't talk about downvotes"" rule that only helps reinforce groupthink, a rule whose punishment is being downvoted and that magically only applies to posts they were going to downvote anyway (which means it's really just an excuse for most people, but it does attract a few additional people who are sadistic about it).

Is that a surprise or shock? People don't like to be ""duped"" or lied too. And given the organic nature of social media, finding out you were duped or lied to invokes extreme anger. Especially given reddit's demographic which skews very young according to their last report (15-24 year old). It's no wonder they lash out at that kind of thing.

> What happens invariably is that you end up like /r/HailCorporate where you freak out when they realize that companies exist.

For a long time I believed that was the place of tinfoil hat nuttery that occasionally finds a nut. I still believe that but I also believe they're finding a whole hell of a lot more nuts these days thanks to reddit's exponential growth. I see it *all the time* as a moderator of reddit's two largest subs. I've since given up trying to fight it now that I see the admins don't care (if they don't care, why should I?), I'm only speaking out now because while we can do next to nothing to fight it, people should realize it exists, and it's abundant. Denying it or sticking your head in the sand doesn't make it go away.

> Spend some time in /r/HailCorporate. They like to pretend that corporations don't exist.

I'm afraid you misunderstand. At this point, if it was only companies shilling their products, I'd be ecstatic. Hell, I'd probably embrace it. Unfortunately, that's only the tip of the iceberg. It's the other entities with agendas I'm more concerned with because their ultimate goal isn't financial in nature. It's hearts and minds -- a much more nefarious and sinister goal. We're talking governments, political causes, movements and other miscellaneous ideologies. If you think those entities are ignoring a website which sees over a billion pageviews a month, you'd be crazy and frankly, naive. Those other entities are harder to spot, harder to track and are more likely to utilize the comment sections versus making a submission. They can also keep track of their success (or failures) thanks to reddit's built in scoring system. :P

And if you think I'm some tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, it's true that I may slightly sound like one, but I've personally fought off those entities myself during my mod duties over the last decade. They *do* exist and they *are* here on reddit.

lol, they're not extraordinary claims... 

It's simply my personal experience in that sub. I am by no means pro-trump, and after posting pretty anti-trump comments in that subreddit a while ago my account was never banned. That's all there is to that story. 

You do realize that you're not worth lying to right? There is absolutely no reason for me to just make shit up. Especially seeing how I have given you no reason to suspect me of lying after previously giving you sources because you didn't believe something.
