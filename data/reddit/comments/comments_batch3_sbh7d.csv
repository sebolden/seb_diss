in doing this i came up with a few reasons why there is a horde of programmers but no designers. programmers/web devs love to dig into a project like this, wrap their head around it, then make improvements on it cause open source is kick ass. this is stereotypical but i doubt to many designers do any kinda of open source work that is this extensive. most probably wouldn't even want to dig into a project this large.

oh and some of [this](http://images.sixrevisions.com/2010/11/11-02_webdesigners_vs_webdevelopers_infographic_small.jpg)

just thought of more to add. extensive html/css/javascript takes for fucking ever to load especially when you are talking about scalability. I mean reddit is usually walking with a limp any way if you added any more glitter it would sneeze and fall over. programmers make it functional but light enough to run and be scalable for a billion page views a month.

Gracias por el baño de humildad.

Estoy de acuerdo contigo en casi todo.EL maniqueísmos es malo. Lo diré de otra manera: muchos latinoamericamos escriben penosamente mal (peor que yo). Muchos que no todos, claro. ¿Qué sería de la literatura en español sin Cortázar, Borges, Márquez y mútiples escritores que me dejo en el tintero?.

Espero que no confundas mis comentarios con cierto sentido de superioridad con respecto a latinoamérica. No es la primera vez que tengo que convencer (más bien intentarlo) a alguien en España de que todos los acentos del castellano en todos los países donde se habla son igual de válidos. 

Al revés pasa igual, he conversado con latinoamericanos que dicen que los españoles lo pronunciamos ""mal"" porque somos menos...argumento bastante estúpido, como puedes imaginar (a eso suelo responder que cuál de los acentos latinos es el correcto: ¿Paraguayo?. ¿Argentino?. ¿Colombiano?. ¿Venezolano?).

Remember that part where I explained that we knew this?

Also, Reddit doesn't put up the front that it is small time, this idea of Reddit is completely made up by Redditors themselves. While yes, Reddit might use that to their advantage, it is only a logical business decision, and it also keeps Reddit running *free to browse*. We don't pay for Reddit, or anything that makes up Reddit, yes, we pay for our internet service, but if I didn't pay for internet service, Reddit would still exist. I understand Reddit needs visitors, but, lets not kid eachother, you need Reddit as much as it needs you, now.

To be honest on all fronts here, the facts are: 

Even if Reddit were a pay-to-browse website, people would still spend their time helping them improve for free. Reddit doesn't express ""Hey, we're small and need help"" but they do take advantage of that idea that they are.

757,694vz,c3075yk,t3_me5e9,t3_me5e9,1321437428.0,1219,"I work in the office of a congressman. There are two ways to get our attention: (1) mass phone calls and (2) form issue mailings. 


1. Phone Calls: Your best bet is to call the D.C. office as they handle more of the policy related matters. When I worked phones, I kept a legal pad in front of me and kept track of the issues that we got a lot of calls on. If an issue got hot [over 25 or so calls], I would let a policy adviser know. I don't know how other offices worked but my Congressman kept tract of the issues that got hot. Here's a little tip for the phone calls though: the person on the other line isn't a miracle worker. No, they can't tell you why the Congressman supports or doesn't support that bill unless the policy advisers have told them to do so. No, they don't care why you think the Congressman is a dumbass for doing this or that. And no, you cannot talk to the Congressman. Keep the call short, tell me which bill you support or don't support, and be polite. If I get three callers yelling and cursing at me and the fourth is polite and thanks me for my time, you can guess which caller I'm going to go the extra mile for. Also, they will usually ask for your name, number, and address before you get off the call. This isn't part of some grand government conspiracy to steal your lunch money. It's so we can keep up to date on the issue. Your info goes into a program which lets us keep tract of constituents by issue so we don't waste our time going through legal pads of caller info when we send out a letter about how the issue got resolved. This program is NOT accessible to the campaign and it would be a violation of federal election law to do so.

Protip: This may get you on a fundraising listserv but calling the campaign office with your policy concerns will ensure the topic is addressed.

1. Mass mailings. There's a commonly held belief that elected officials give letters more weight than other communication. This is only partially true. Some people send us a letter about every topic that ever crosses their mind. And I mean EVERY topic. If you always write us, we barely pay attention to you after a while. I would say that 80% of the letters we receive come from 5% of the people who ever send a letter to our office. If it's the first time you've contacted the office, you'll get more attention. That being said, when I handled mail, what really got my attention was receiving several form issue letters everyday over a sustained period of time. When I say form issue letters, I mean the things that say ""DEAR CONGRESSPERSON, I [INSERT YOUR NAME] SUPPORT H.R. OVER 9000 AND URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT TOO."" For example, I remember receiving a couple of these form letters concerning the funding of a local military base on a Monday or a Tuesday and basically ignoring it. However, as the week progressed, the number we received went from a couple to several dozen per day. You bet your sweet ass we addressed that issue as soon as we could find a camera.",False,False,False,1174,1,1321434855.0,False,False

Dear Congressman %$#*:

I am writing you today about a provision in the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) introduced on Oct. 26, 2011. It seems to me that this legislation had the effect of creating an American internet firewall, one that could severely restrict the ability of Americans Citizens to access the internet similar to the regressive policies of countries like China. In June of this year, the United Nations declared that access to the internet is a basic human right, and unfettered access to information was crucial in the recent Democratic uprisings in the Middle East. It is very disheartening to learn that the US Congress is considering the restriction of a resource so vast and important that it has completely changed communications, access to informational resources and the expression of all of our freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution.

Specifically, the SOPA does two things that promote the censorship of the internet in the USA. First, it would allow for suspension of service prior to being found guilty by holding any site with user generated content. Currently, websites such as Google, Twitter and YouTube operate under a ""safe-harbor"" provision in the Digital Millenium Copyright Act that, if invalidated, would force these sites to suspend user access before determining whether the users were actually guilty of copyright infringement. This is frankly a usurpation of due process established by the 5th & 14th Amendments to the US Constitution. Second, Section 102 of the SOPA allows for the Blacklisting, by the Attorney General's Office, of any website accused of harboring a copyright infringement, again without the prior establishment of guilt under due process. The ability of a government agency to ban user access to an online site or service without due process is simply a reprehensible act of censorship and nothing less.

Online piracy can indeed be a problem, although in some cases piracy can lead to an increase in visibility for software or an online service that ends up creating more revenue for the developer, artist or creator of the product. The issue of copyright infringement pales in comparison, however, to the idea that American access to the internet could be disrupted, censored or denied without first establishing guilt. Free and unrestricted access to information is the arbiter of a Democracy; restricting the access of American Citizens to the vast resources of the internet in any form goes against the very values enshrined in the Democratic spirit of our Country.

Thank you for your time and service,

>Dear Congressman/Congresswoman _____________ :

>I understand you have significant experience in law. As such, you probably thought that the Stop Online Piracy Act you sponsored in Congress was a good idea. It's intended to finally crack down on intellectual property theft, and help to encourage intellectual property holders to continue to create.

>However, as someone who is more than proficient in Internet technologies, culture, law, and practices, I fear the bill you're supporting would be a significant threat to everyone's freedoms.

>After reading the text of the bill, my understanding of it is that it would not only hold site owners responsible for the content users post, it would also require various internet services (DNS, advertisement companies, and ISPs) to cease all business with and revoke access to sites that are only accused of hosting infringing material. This, I feel, would violate due process, restrict free speech, and cause a significant chilling effect in new ideas/designs.

>Please, consider the following: suppose that you and I both own web services. If we are in competition, anything that I can do to get more traffic than you would be a bonus to my profits. Under this bill, the easiest way for me to get an advantage would be to upload my intellectual property to your site (using proper obfuscation technologies, like a VPN or TOR), and then accuse you of hosting illegally obtained material. You, without the benefit of a court to defend yourself, would find your site's name removed from American DNS servers, would lose significant ad revenue, and would be locked out of your site until you could find and delete my material. It would be so easy to repeat that, once you were operating again, I could use the same trick. There would be no defense against this attack, and it would be completely legal. In fact, the terms of this bill are so broad that I wouldn't even need to actually upload my material to your site! I could just accuse you of hosting my material. You would have no opportunity to dispute my claim, and you would have the onus of proof of your own innocence, instead of me having the onus to prove your guilt.

>If these two scenarios seem farfetched, I ask you to refer to the recent actions of Warner Bros. They sent false take-down requests to Hotfile, and even used Hotfile's anti-piracy programs to remove protected materials they didn't own. 

>I assure you, this is common practice on the internet. If all I need to do is accuse you of doing something, and you are assumed guilty until you can prove your innocence, our entire system of justice and due process is undermined.

>This bill would also causes a chilling effect on the production of new ideas. If all it takes is one jealous competitor, or one sloppy rights-holder, to permanently remove my ability to produce, I would refrain from doing so.

>If you now consider the current system, you'll see that the DMCA has sufficient power to protect ideas. It may have flaws, and its jurisdiction may not apply to foreign sites, but that is the nature of international law. America, though we are a great nation, can neither enforce our standards upon other countries, nor can it undermine its citizens' ability to freely access all material online. However, the DMCA is sufficient to discourage piracy as well as compassionate enough to allow new ideas to come to light.

>In conclusion, this bill you have sponsored would not solve any problems, and would only further tarnish America's reputation abroad. We would engage in the same louche practices we condemn China for practicing.

>For this reason, I do not support your decision to sponsor this bill. Further, I think that your sponsorship of this bill shames the Democratic party, as well as the great state of Florida. You should be ashamed.

>Sincerely,

>Light-of-Aiur

It has come to my attention that you will soon be voting on the ""Stop Online Piracy Act"" or SOPA act. I am writing to urge you not to vote for the SOPA.

There are plenty of laws already in place that govern the dissemination of copy written material, and we don't need any more. Forcing site owners to police the content of their communities' at the behest of copyright holder will only stem creativity and restrict freedom of expression. 

Big copyright holders have pockets deep enough to police the use of their own content. They should adjust their business practices to encourage purchase, and not work to further punish their customers. Instead, SOPA will allow the government to become the copyright enforcement arm of big corporations.

Furthermore, creation of additional governmental entities to support SOPA, should it be voted into law, will only increase the already large burden on the taxpayer. As I mentioned above, existing laws provide plenty of ability for copyright holders to enforce their rights. 

SOPA would be an expensive, redundant law endangering freedom of expression, hindering creativity, and putting a non-trivial amount of power over the openness and freedom of the internet in the hands of corporations that do not always have the best interest of the American people as a top priority. I encourage you to vote NO to the SOPA.

In effect, those who are trying to pass a bill that effects ALL OF US, are IGNORING THE OPINION OF ALL OF US.

Hi, my name is REPLACE YOUR NAME HERE. I'm from WHERE YOU ARE FROM. I don't normally write to my congressman, but this is vitally important to the integrity of all that America stands for.

The Stop Online Piracy Act goes way too far, giving too much censorship power to those who would abuse it without any regard to the consequences such as collateral damage that will effect hundreds of thousands of websites. Not just the very few websites that host illegal content, but every single website, even the WhiteHouse.org

Any user could post in a forum, message board, or comment field, a link to a questionable website. If SOPA passes, by law WhiteHouse.org would have to be blocked after an infringement claim.

The very foundation of America is based on free information exchange and freedom of speech. This bill goes against everything that defines America, and it serves nothing but to perpetuate and assist old broken business models that refuse to embrace the internet and adapt. The RIAA and MPAA keep influencing Congress to adapt these draconian measures to help them survive with zero regard for how it effects all Americans.

The Safe Harbor provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act has enabled many vital and internet defining websites to function such as YouTube. Without the Safe Harbor provisions, a single bad upload by any user to YouTube could shut down the entire site based off an infringement claim. The DMCA already provides adequate legal means to take down infringing works from a website. This system has worked for over 10 years, but SOPA has measures that will effectively kill the Safe Harbor provisions of the DMCA, which would stifle innovation meaning no more sites being created such as YouTube and Wikipedia, and leading to less job creation in the IT and Web Development fields.

This is the absolute worst bill I've ever seen, and I am appalled that it would even be considered.

I would ask that you revisit your approval of the bill, keeping in mind its material and potential causatum. Again, while I can stand behind the desire to limit theft and protect personal and intellectual property, there are the rights of the many to consider as well. I think that this bill tips the balance from personal freedom and constitutional guarantees over to the side of corporate interest.  
I welcome your defense of your sponsorship and any pertinent resources affirming your position on the matter. Thank you for hearing me out.""*  
i would recommend others to voice their opinions as well; they do not need to be damning.  thank you to the op for bringing this topic to our attention, along with the sponsors of the bill.",False,False,False,17220,6961,1317675880.0,False,False

I'm writing to register my STRONG opposition to SOPA, the so-called Stop Internet Piracy Act that congress is currently considering. While strongly liberal, I firmly believe that the internet should *not* be legislated or regulated, unless that legislation or regulation acts to strengthen the freedoms available to citizens who make use of the internet. Privacy, the free flow of information, ease of access, and unhindered (read: uncensored) communications are what make the internet what it has been for the last 15 years: an ever-expanding segment of the economy and an engine of growth and human development.

We only have to look at the last year to see the impact the internet has had. Free flow of information allowed protests in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere to reform if not overthrow despots in their countries, bringing democratic reforms. The internet as it exists today allows genuine democratic action and organization by otherwise powerless people. It literally empowers people with democratic capabilities; self-publishing, organization, privacy, etc. America should not set an example for other nations to follow by restricting internet use for purposes that it deems unacceptable, especially if those reasons are economic--and do some research here, there are very strong arguments to be made that piracy does NOT harm the economy.

Sure I'm paving a slippery slope argument here, but how big of a leap is it for us to say that today we're going to ban websites that hurt the economy by allowing piracy, and tomorrow we're going to ban websites that hurt the economy by promoting unpopular taxation measures. Will the Occupy websites, on the internet of tomorrow that SOPA would help shape, be censored? The Tea Party's website? Rick Perry's? The internet doesn't kill people, you actually can’t kill people online unlike the real world, it is a unique territory that should be treated as such. The government must keep its HANDS OFF so that humanity can learn how best to use the net going forward, to bring new economic, political, or other opportunities we can't yet imagine to future generations.

I hope that, if or when Congresswoman McCollum has a say on SOPA, that she votes no. Further, I hope she takes a stand before the bill comes to a vote, and that she goes on the record in support of a free and open internet.

[Google Public Policy Blog Post: Google copyright policy counsel Katherine Oyama will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on the Stop Online Piracy Act.](http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2011/11/testifying-before-us-house-of.html)

Google's position: 


""We strongly support the goal of the bill -- cracking down on offshore websites that profit from pirated and counterfeited goods -- but we’re concerned the way it’s currently written would threaten innovation, jobs, and free expression. We are not alone in our concerns. Earlier this week, we joined eight other Internet companies -- AOL, eBay, Facebook, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twitter, Yahoo!, and Zynga -- in a letter to Congress, echoing concerns voiced by industry associations, entrepreneurs, small business owners, librarians, law professors, venture capitalists, human rights advocates, cybersecurity experts, public interest groups, and tens of thousands of private citizens.

Google takes the problem of online piracy and counterfeiting very seriously, devoting our best engineering talent and tens of millions of dollars every year to combat it through our Content ID system on YouTube, our efforts to make copyright work better online, and our work to keep counterfeiters out of our ads system.

Katherine’s testimony will offer recommendations for more targeted ways to combat foreign “rogue” websites that are dedicated to copyright infringement and trademark counterfeiting, while preserving the innovation and dynamism that has made the Internet such an important driver of economic growth and job creation.""",False,False,False,32389,4392,1267698951.0,False,True

Copyright law today is not written to protect creators, it is not written to promote sharing ideas, and it is not written to secure the future creations of material.  Copyright law is written specifically to financially benefit a small handful of very large corporations.

How disgusting copyright law is, becomes very obvious when you compare it to patent law.

Patents are for inventions, and usually take years and lots of money to secure the patent.  Patent protection runs between 8 and 20 years, with some ability to extend it.  Copyright law on the other hand, is automatic when the property is created, then the protection runs the life of the creator(s) plus 70 years or 120 years if it is a corporate creation.

The whole point of having copyrights and patents expire, was so the creators could make money at the start, and then share it with the world.  With the length of copyright, material will have little to no use once the copyright expires.

""Happy Birthday to You"" was sort of written in 1893, but under the name ""Good Morning to You"" with slightly different lyrics, and based on songs that were in the public domain at the time.  Later on a group of children changed some of the words and it became ""Happy Birthday to You"".  It wasn't officially copyrighted until 1935 and doesn't end in the US until 2030.  The original creators and their heirs are not benefiting from the copyright, restaurants can't even sing the song to patrons, and any movie or TV show needs to pay royalties to Time Warner if they want to use it.

It should also be noted that every time copyright is extended, it coincides with when Mickey Mouse is about to become public domain.

I am a web design, software engineer, and graphic designer who spends an inordinate amount of time on the internet. I used to download illegal software, games, movies and music, but with the increase in easy delivery methods of this content, I no longer pirate media. 

I use Hulu and Netflix to legally watch movies and shows. I use Pandora to legally listen to music. I use Steam to legally download games. These services were not available before, but they exist now because the internet fosters this sort of business.

SOPA will give big guns to organizations KNOWN for acting like children.

These 'children' refused to give the people what they wanted (easy digital access to content), so the people took it anyway. Napster grew out of this, and was eventually crushed, but not before paving the way for the online media consumption services I use now; Not before forcing the industry to get with the times and deliver what the people want using the technology the people use.

Stuff like SOPA is written by officials who do not understand how the internet works, and who will kill the goose who lays the golden eggs.

This message regards the upcoming Stop Online Piracy Act.

A free Internet is a human right. We are in a recession and you want to pull the plug on the web? There are far too many failings in this current administration -- what are people going to do? 

The only reason I have a job is because I could learn on the Internet for free. This is something that does not belong to you, or anyone. 

It is time you grow up and become a helpful person in this society. If you believe a censored Internet is a good thing, and is worth this legislation, please resign from your position immediately.

The Internet is something that all people should have, for free, without censorship.

Are we now living in China? Can I ask you about this comparison in public, on TV? Please take a moment to think of where you are directing the future of this country.

If you enact this legislation I will become a part of the recall effort to get you out of office, or make sure you are not elected again.

Congressman XXXX,
I urge you to reconsider your sponsorship of SOPA on this day of American Internet Censorship. SOPA's careless and vaguely written legislation is sure to ruin the fabric of the internet and have harmful effects on American society as a whole. I urge you not to support this bill as it is not in the best interests of the people you were elected to represent. As a government official you were elected to do your best to adhere to the concerns of the American public and your constituents. Your job is to protect the freedoms upon which our nation was founded. Therefore, I implore you not to vote in the best interests of specific corporate entities (The MPAA, RIAA, Viacom, Netflix, Macmillan Publishers, etc) but instead choose to recognize the adverse effects this law will have on the vast amount of other industries to which the internet is vital as well as American society as a whole.

The aforementioned associations themselves are attempting to push this bill because they are having difficulties adapting to the quickly changing technologies that human innovation and progress are blessing us with. I ask you not to stifle this progress but rather demand that these associations progress themselves and find ways to make themselves and their industries profitable as we move continually into the future. Technology and society will forever change and evolve. It is our job as human beings not to continually attempt to fight these forces, which has throughout history proved to be futile. Instead we should attempt to evolve ourselves as well and adapt to these changes. Progress is the only hope we have of creating the more perfect society that we and our future generations all hope to live by.

Sincerely,
xxx

The MIAA and RIAA sue by Dynamic IP address and often get grandmothers who don't pirate files but got the IP address after someone else used it and thus she gets sued.

The DMCA is Unconstitutional as it takes away consumer rights and gives them to the corporations. The consumer no longer owns the product, but buys the right to use it, which can be taken away for no reason at all. You don't own the songs or movies you buy, you buy a license to view them. Before the DMCA you bought an audio CD or DVD or VHS tape it belonged to you, you could lend it to a friend or make a backup of it. The MPAA vs. Sony over the BetaMax is an example of what I am talking about. The MPAA lost that as consumers had a right to tape movies and TV shows to the BetaMax VCR because of the US Constitution and the Copyright law and 'fair use'. That is why the DMCA was passed to take away those rights. Now we pay for it with a bad economy and also now censorship. It is not Capitalism, it is not Communism, it is Corporalism where corporations run our government and take away our rights and freedoms for their profits. They use lobbyists to get the votes in Congress and the White House to approve it.

Definition of CENSOR

*transitive verb*
: to examine in order to suppress or delete anything considered objectionable

Censorship is as old as man itself. It doesn’t only apply to information or ideas, the act of censoring is to use force to prevent actions from being taken by others.

People have tried censoring books, plays, movies, VHS tapes, audio cassette tapes, alcohol, weed and other drugs, the licking of exotic frogs, other people, words, languages, rituals, cartoons, toys, smoking, gay marriage, weapons, monies, gold, silver, video games, flags, congregations, ideas, religions, travel, burkas, hats, child pornography, online poker, certain forms of poker in California, tv ads, etc etc. The list goes on and on.

Whenever people disagree with the actions of others, government is called in to take action on their behalf. In this current case, the US movie industry has been bribing people in government to get them to threaten people in order to keep them from sharing files.

There is a demand for both privacy and the sharing of information. That demand can’t be censored or regulated away, trying it will only yield new and creative ways to meet those demands. You can’t fight smoke with fire.",False,False,False,2292,187,1319198886.0,False,False

This isn't about censorship, or free speech, this is about the privileged majority being able to oppress a minority and government taking steps to stop that, and the privileged campaigning against having some of their unfair privileges taken away from them.

What do I mean? I mean the fact that getting pirated shit has become so easy recently, and we like getting shit for free, and then we come up with nonsense to back up why just taking shit for free is somehow a good thing, and that people trying to stop us are the bad guy and are oppressing us, even though it's just about GETTING SHIT WE DON'T NEED THAT COSTS MONEY TO MAKE, FOR FREE. 

Well boo fucking hoo. Your casual attitude towards piracy made this happen. Guess what? You aren't going to be able to get whatever the fuck you want for nothing any more, because the people who make it are daring to be so 'greedy' as to ask for money in exchange for it. If you don't like something - fine, you don't have to pay for it, you don't have to have it. But if you want something, and the person who made it wants something in return then GIVE them that thing in return or DON'T HAVE IT.

Not being to get access to entertainment for free instead of paying for it IS NOT CENSORSHIP.

I do, however, require some clarification. What exactly is the goal of revealing the hypocrisy (not to mention ignorance) of our legislatures? It seems to me that the most powerful force behind the work you all have done here is to create the largest possible mess for the sponsors of this bill to have to clean up. In other words, creating extremely annoying, toilsome and tedious work for them. This, in my opinion is a good idea, but turning the gun back on them will prompt one of a few results (granted that they are in discordance with SOPA): either a) they seek the explicit permissions [rather, have an intern do so]; b) simply remove the content; or c) They realize that they do not fully understand the implications of a bill that they are championing. 

Obviously ""c"" is the most desirable option. If there are other incentives behind this particular effort, please do tell me.

Bad advice.  You should call the district office, because you will be able to ensure that you are calling the same time zone, ergo, able to talk with someone.  Calling DC at your 1500 PST break won't mean diddly because it is 1800 there, and people are gone.  Second, the DC lines will get jammed, making it unnecessarily long to talk with someone.

Mr. ******,

I am one of your constituents from ********, **. I am writing to express my concerns about H.R.3261, the ""Stop Online Piracy Act"" or SOPA.

As you know, this act would give intellectual property owners the power to shut down any website's revenue flow with nothing more than a letter, requiring the website owner to file a petition if they wish to overturn this - of course, who knows how much income the website owner will have lost along the way?

The bill also give government lawyers, Internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, and payment processors the ability to block any site at their own volition. As an American who rejects the notion of a ""nanny state,"" this is equal parts chilling and infuriating. 

This hamfisted approach to a sweeping, mostly unregulated crackdown on any site that someone doesn't like puts the innovative industry of the Internet at risk. In an article posted October 20th, you said, ""We just do not want the federal government to grow so big that it stifles growth and prosperity..."" I challenge you, sir, to stand by your words.

Legislation is needed to protect copyright holders from intellectual property theft. But not like this. Not a big bulky piece of law that gives the government such power to censor sites. Not something that we'll have to spend the next decade trying to take apart. Copyright owners deserve protection, but not at the cost of the American people's freedom.

Dear Representative Frelinghuysen,

I'm a software consultant who relies on the availability of online information & communities to effectively do my job.  

H.R.3261, the 'Stop Online Piracy Act', could potentially destroy these invaluable resources which help drive American productivity and innovation.  Additionally, with the internet being a global community, this bill will merely drive online piracy further into other countries (i.e. Russia, Netherlands), at the cost of punishing law abiding Americans.

Good afternoon,

  I am writing today to express my concern over rights of television news channels and the unapproved use of their televised video content.
  
  Upon viewing Congresswoman Schultz's YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz) I noticed several useages of network news video clips.
  
  Examples include:
  
    Questioning cuts to the Social Security Administration (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/20/uFB59eSJeMc)
	Copied from on-air footage of CBS 4
	
	Custs to Early Education in HR1 (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/19/iuOoDGP9x18)
	Copied from on-air footage of 7 News
	
	Possible cuts to Early Education programs (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/18/8QfgUDvEvfE)
	Copied from on-air footage of an unkown Florida CBS affiliate
	
	Rep. Wasserman Schultz interviewed on MSNBC's Morning Joe (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/29/cWYUV2XEzlU)
	Copied from on-air footage of Morning Joe on msnbc
	
	Rep, Wasserman Schultz on Andrea Mitchell Reports (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/30/X4K7vNAJFw0)
	Copied from on-air footage of Andrea Mitchell reports on msnbc
	
	Rep. Wasserman Schultz appears on FOX News America's Newsroom (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/31/4wOtiMPohfw)
	Copied from on-air footage of America's Newsroom on Fox Business
	
	Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz appears on MSNBC's The Daily Rundown (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/33/_AqmmsMJPHw)
	Copied from on-air footage on The Daily Rundown on msnbc
	
	Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz appears on MSNBC News Live (http://www.youtube.com/user/RepWassermanSchultz#p/u/37/lFHiE63I1Ug)
	Copied from on-air footage of News Nation on msnbc
	
  There are more examples, but the above should be sufficient for my point. Given Congresswoman Schultz's co-sponsoring of H.R.3261 (the Stop Online Piracy Act), she of all people would be keenly aware of the need to receive proper copyright holder approval for All media usage. I am here-by requesting copies of the required copyright holder approvals for all of the above listed copywritten videos posted by her administration to YouTube.
  
  If such written approval cannot be shown, then it is Congresswoman Schultz's legal obligation to remove all noted videos and any others which may be in violation of copyright law, or else face all appropriate punishments as laid out in current law.
  
  Thank you for your time,

Mr. ********, I am deeply concerned about the so-called ""Stop Online Piracy Act"", up for a vote today. This bill is structured in a manner that would be more restrictive than the Great Firewall of China, allowing private corporate interests to dictate internet policy and enforcement. Not only is this a dangerous precedent, it will fundamentally change the internet as we know it. Gone will be the days of an entrepreneur being able to bootstrap an online business, pushed out and crushed by established corporate competition. This will suffocate innovation and kill jobs. This is not alarmist and not a small matter. I urge you to vote against this if at all possible, and influence other members of congress who may not fully understand the implications of this bill due to a concerted lobbying effort by large corporate interests. This is not a ""D"" or ""R"" issue, it's a matter of protecting the rights of Americans and fostering the culture that has made the Internet the job-creating, wealth-producing powerhouse it is today. Please, please vote ""NO"" on SOPA.

Just download illegally instead. This bill will almost certainly fail to make that any more difficult, as all attempts before it have. As with all attempts at censorship and DRM, this will only make life harder for people not doing anything wrong. 

Example: I own a blueray disc of a movie but, the easiest way for me to watch the movie in blueray resolution on my computer is to download a rip of it from bittorrent. There really doesn't seem to be much point in me having bought the disc at all since it doesn't make it easier to play it (it only plays with a shitty application I have to pay for that only runs in windows and at much lower resolution because I don't have an HDMI compatible monitor), it doesn't make it legal for me to download or play the rip, doesn't protect me from having my net access suspended for downloading it. None of this would be an issue if they weren't so scared of people pirating them but, it's taken all of the incentives to actually pay for it away to the point where I am still pirating it even if I've paid for the disc already.

Good morning,

I am from Virginia, but believe this issue will have far reaching negative effects nationwide.  I do not approve of the SOPA bill, nor do I approve of your sponsorship of said bill.  
I understand and welcome your commitment to stopping what some argue as theft, yet I cannot condone what I perceive to be an affront on personal liberties and others, including, but not limited to violation of the first amendment; the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and the due process to which persons and corporate entities (e.g. a company operating a website) are entitled.

I would ask that you revisit your approval of the bill, keeping in mind its material and potential causatum. Again, while I can stand behind the desire to protect personal and intellectual property, there are the rights of the people to consider as well. This bill tips the balance from personal freedom and constitutional guarantees over to the side of corporate interest.  I welcome any pertinent resources affirming your position. Thank you for your time and patience in this matter.",False,False,False,72525,596,1317145565.0,False,False

On the vehicular highways, speed limits are largely disregarded and there are millions upon millions of violations that could be handed out every day.  Is it really the case that too many people are being reprimanded for the system to handle?

You are right about everyone being a potential violator.  Here is what happens.  This situation gives the individual policeman a great amount of power to simply pick, or pick on, any person he chooses, for any reason he chooses.

The power of discretion is LOVED by enforcement officials.  He has the power to harass you that much more, and you can't stop him because you were speeding, just like everyone else.

In the case of internet censorship, they will pick and choose whomever is most annoying, or useful for their cause, whatever that may be, and it may change with the winds.

The amount of submissions that these sites get is astronomical- it is simply not possible to vet every last submission. Not without employing so many people you’d be bankrupt pretty much right away.

The system isn’t perfect. For one thing it means someone has to actually notice and report the content, and then the site has to take it down. By which time the content has spread to a dozen other places and been accessed by thousands of people. But can you think of anything better? The supporters of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) think so.

They want to do away with the ‘safe harbour’ part of the DMCA, forcing sites to vet every last submission or risk being sued into the ground. Oh, and on top of that they will censor any site that hosts, shows or links to pirated material or- and here is the kicker ‘counterfit gooods’. Censor as in- you will not be able to access this is you live in the US. At all.

So, basically this act, should it pass would trigger the following: YouTube as we know it would be killed. As would almost every social networking site (including Facebook and Twitter) unless every single post you make is checked, lest it contain a link to the latest shitty Hollywood blockbuster. And you thought privacy terms at the moment were bad?

It is in human nature to share and want to be entertained. They are trying to impose their values on everyone else. If copyright was for a sane duration (e.g. 14 years), it wouldn't be quite so bad.

I used to pirate music, now I buy it because it's easier and better and the price point is reasonable. I still pirate TV shows, but I pay for cable anyways, so they're not losing anything, and the price point for TV shows is too high.

Feelings on piracy aside, eliminating the safe harbor provision is very dangerous. I understand that there are sites which only exist to share such materials, but I can easily see cases where someone doesn't like what a site is saying and posts a link to copyrighted material to have them shut down. I don't trust the federal government with a potato gun, let alone power to seize domain names, shut down ISPs and payment processors.

Perhaps its time to stop fighting technology and many people's desires and figure out a sane copyright system. Prior to the [Statute of Anne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne) there wasn't really a copyright system.

H.R.3261, the 'Stop Online Piracy Act', will dramatically harm and stifle free speech on the Internet. It would put the United States further behind in our ability to utilize technology, which is something we can not afford at this point in our history. As a strong supporter of civil liberties and a hippocratic government (one which first and foremost Does No Harm), this proposed law stands out to me as written for and by certain corporate interests, at the harm of other corporate interests and the public at large. It will serve to stifle what should be protected forms of expression including some of the most popular and lucrative websites on the Internet; sites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook.  Even more importantly, it will create serious hindrances to new innovation from internet startups, stifling the ability of entrepreneurs to succeed in what is the new electronic iteration of the American Dream.

A lot of people felt that it was disturbing and disgusting, unethical, illegal, and would sicken most of the general public, and when you said that,  you were right.  But many would say that children going to a bible camp/military camp/young republicans & democrats is, essentially, doing the same thing by exploiting of young people before they have the common sense to know what they're doing.  So let's shut those down.

China blocks pornography because it feels that it's immoral and a detriment to productive society, just as they block IMDB (for some stupid ass reason, pisses me off...) and parts of the Wikipedia.  They are so afraid of the public opinion turning sour and rebelling against them that they do something like this.  

How about this?  I will bet you that all of the pictures on /r/jailbait were probably pulled off of facebook or myspace.  Ok, maybe only 90%.  So let's shut those down, because they're hosting the same thing.  Are they ok because of the context of the sites?  Who determines what is a correct context?  They are the same pictures, same pedos looking at them, if not more.  

Here's another example someone else used.  P2P file sharing was being used to shuttle child porn, so they should censor that.  Or better yet, the internet in general is being used to trade CP.  Let's censor the whole thing.  You could also use the USPS to send CP to someone else, so let's scan all packages and open anything suspicious.  I heard that you could also get CP into the country in your checked baggage, so let's put people at the airport to search all luggage for CP and anything else we deem offensive.  I think people are talking about meeting times for CP, so let's wiretap all telephones in the country in order to find those disgusting horrible pedos.  We should also monitor streets and alleys with cameras to catch them trading pictures and videos by flash drive.  Don't complain!!!

For its unusually strong expression of irrational rage and complete lack of logical or factual content, your comment has been selected out of literally hundreds of competitors. 

Firstly, pedophiles are sexually attracted specifically to children. Although minors are in a sense legally treated as children, puberty, with its obvious physical and mental changes, clearly differentiates most teenagers from prepubescent children. What was actually on /r/jailbait was pictures of teenagers, so of course it would more properly be called an ephebophile subreddit, although I would not be surprised if pedophiles look at it. Also, teenagers themselves often have sex drives. This (generally) causes them to be attracted to people around their own age, which might cause them to be interested in such a subreddit. This seems to me perfectly healthy, particularly considering that the content was not hardcore porn and not even full nudes, but instead the type of thing one might see in person by going to the beach. But I suppose this makes them pedophiles as well in your mind; I can't imagine what you must think of teenagers who actually have sexual relations with others of their own age.

I see that you make what seems to be an unsupported claim that most of those visiting /r/jailbait are actual child molesters. You should consider that, by definition, not even all pedophiles are child molesters, as it is an orientation encouraging, rather than actually requiring, such acts. And of course, as explained above, not everyone attracted to teenagers could possibly be considered a pedophile, or even abnormal. 

Perhaps your reference to ""illegal and insanely unethical stuff"" which ""should see them jailed"" refers to possession of child pornography? Possession does not actually harm anyone, and the claim that it is a crime by “creating a market for it” (it being sexual exploitation of minors) is so outrageous that it is no wonder it is never applied to any other crime. You should consider what otakucode says [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/m6wyj/florida_judge_sentenced_a_26yrold_with_no/c2ypk69) about allowing precrime to pervert our legal system. 

Also, this does not seem to be widely understood, but there hasn't been any real loss of jailbait material; consider all of [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/truejailbait).

Then someone posted a teaser of their girlfriend and said they had nudes. People in the comments requested nudes over PM.

One of the jailbait mods claimed that he knew that nude pictures had been exchanged over PM, but then said that he didn't actually know... because obviously he doesn't have access to other people's PM's.

Despite the fact that this conversation could have taken place in any subreddit at all, and additionally has no bearing or influence on people sharing child porn over PM's, the reddit admins used it as a reason to ban the subreddit. They didn't ban any of the other jailbait subreddits where identical content is posted. They only banned the subreddit getting negative attention.

Something tells me that if a bunch of users started asking for nude photos in r/IAMA, it wouldn't get banned in order to stop people doing that. The posts would be removed, as they were in r/jailbait, and life would have gone on as normal.

tl;dr The admins had huge pressure due to anderson cooper and used a single incident to justify banning the entire subreddit when they had the chance and could do it under the cover of a scandal, even though it obviously had no practical impact on the problem they claimed to be dealing with.

But, this is what I sent, omitting a few minor swaps of content. And yes, my representative is a Congresswoman. So much for having Congress and the HR separate.


Dear Congresswoman $$$$$$$,

> My name is $$$$$$, and I am a student of Software Engineering at $$$$$$, and a resident of the $$$$$$ district of the city of $$$$$$$$$. Yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee held a scheduled hearing on SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, also known as H.R.3261. (For reference, the text of this article is available here: http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf). The intent of this act was to allow the Attorney General to seek injunctions against foreign websites (Sec. 102(a)), allowing the legal right of the court to order Internet service providers to block access by subscribers to such websites, in addition to previous acts which allowed the court to issue cease-and-desist orders to domestic websites (hosted in the United States or maintained primarily by domestic United States residents). The bill also allows the court to order payment networks (eg. PayPal) to cancel or prevent electronic transactions concerning foreign sites, and to order advertising websites to cancel or prevent advertisements relating to such foreign sites from appearing in search results or in-site advertisements (eg. Google Web Search/Google Ads). The overall goal of this bill is fairly clear and understandably noble: To prevent piracy or illegal distribution of intellectual property, including confidential information, salable media content such as music, image, or video content, software, electronic documents, and other information which may be damaging to individuals or groups, financially or otherwise, as in the two separate notable scandals concerning the websites Napster and Wikileaks.

> There are several issues with this act that I would like to identify, at least from my individual perspective, which may or may not represent the views held by my peers. I would also like to echo some common concerns which I have observed from people similarly affected by this act. First, there is a personal concern that this means of forceful blockage of access to foreign sites may be misused in cases where the severity of the punishment greatly exceeds the severity or intent of the crime; this stems from a striking similarity to acts imposed by the Egyptian government which led up to the internationally-recognized, government-enforced telecommunications blackout of the past year. In the case of Egypt's citizens, they were simply attempting to describe their lack of personal freedom to the world, and were being prevented from doing even that. In a volatile world situation, where Internet usage has become synonymous with freedom, an act by the United States which allows the government to censor Internet sites at its own discretion is, to the public eye, an act against the founding beliefs of freedom of thought and speech. Such an act in its current form could be met with sheer public aggression, on the scale of the Occupy rallies.

> The second, and probably the key concern, is the sheer amount of information currently being shared by typical users of websites such as Google, YouTube, and Facebook, for the sake of intellectual, artistic, political and social means which, by the terms of this act, qualifies as affiliating with illegal foreign websites. One striking simile was that this act essentially provided an electronic equivalent to arresting someone for writing a school report on a Mexican drug cartel, because they were affiliating themselves with the drug cartel. By the terms described in the act, even the websites of the committee members who drafted the act would be subject to court orders, as was discovered by independent researchers centralized here: http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/me5e9/american_censorship_day_stand_up_for/ . The concern is that this could easily be used as a tool to restrict rights of individuals or groups in similar fashion to the tactics employed by former U.S. Senator McCarthy during the Cold War, or the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its precedents. 

> A third significant point I would like to bring up, being a software engineer currently both in study and in employment at a software company, is the relative complexity of suddenly imposing such a specific restriction onto an existing, complex telecommunications network such as the Internet (and constituent technologies, including Domain Name Service (DNS), Dynamic Host Controller Protocol (DHCP), and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)), in which many methods for circumventing existing security systems are already being discovered and utilized regularly. The core technologies which make up the Internet are internationally standardized by organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and ISO, and are maintained and updated by working groups which vote upon, design, implement and test any additions or ratifications to the core functionality of their standards. Following a standards update, there is usually a significant time lag before technology developers can produce new, stable, standards-compliant products or software, and following that, there is another lag before those products can be adopted for use in existing telecommunications systems. By the federal court system imposing modifications to DNS services (as stated within the act,) for example, they would effectively be providing the courts a federal denial-of-service (DoS) system, and would deliberately violate the design considerations of DNS technology that seeks specifically to avoid denial-of-service as much as possible. This addition of a federal ""backdoor"" is simply not feasible or realistic to  at worst, and would be easily circumventable or maliciously exploitable at best, through the use of existing methods based on benevolent software and hardware currently available to the average US citizen.

> My request to you is that when deciding upon this act, you perform further research into this subject and take into careful consideration the concerns I've covered here. If nothing else is accomplished, at least make sure that the concerns are made known among the House of Representatives as best you can. I succinctly hope that I am not the first, nor the last to send you a letter on this subject, and I pray that you act as would befit a true representative of the state of $$$$$$$$$$ and the country of the United States of America. Thank you for your time.

> A concerned citizen,

>Saying things like ""they just throw them out"" gives you an excuse to not spend 5 minutes and write a proper letter. 

Saying things like ""Saying things like ""they just throw them out"" gives you an excuse to not spend 5 minutes and write a proper letter."", just gives you an excuse to waste 5 minutes and feel like you've done your part, when in actual fact you've done nothing, in fact you've done worse than nothing if you're persuading other people to waste their time too.

Say 5,000 people spend 5 minutes writing a letter to their congressman. That's 416 man hours. Let's assume an average hourly wage of those 5,000 people to be $10 an hour. So that's $4,160 versus an utter waste of time.

2327,4dfhp,c30c7il,t1_c307396,t3_me5e9,1321479733.0,1627,"You think that's strange? Back in college my linguistics professor had a long-running, optional assignment in which any student attending the school could participate. We were allowed to work on it for the entire four-year span in which we attended, and could turn it in for a mysterious and unexplained ""extraordinary credit bonus"" at any point in time before the last four weeks of our senior year. We were to make our best attempt at creating our own language, and learn to speak it well enough to carry on a detailed conversation with him on stage at a free assembly to be attended by any current or former student or faculty members who wished to come.

Well, I was never one to back down from a challenge, so I started working on my language that same night. I finished the assignment six weeks before graduation, turned in the requested language bible I had created, and spent the next few weeks preparing for the coming conversational exam extravaganza. The day came, and there were hundreds of people in attendance. The professor took the stage and explained the premise of the exercise to everyone, then introduced me to a round of applause. Nervous, but determined, I made my way to the stage. 

I had expected this exercise to simply consist of him asking me various questions in English and me replying in my language; I was leveled, however, when he began the conversation by speaking fluently in my created tongue. The conversation went as follows:

> Him: ""Ror grubburg, mossom non lil tomot dud. Ses nin?"" (Good morning, my favorite student of all. Are you ready to begin?)
> Me: ""Oho ror grubburg, klinenilk. Ses."" (Good morning to you as well. I am.)
> Him: ""Ses ror asasa hoh ririr ana gooloog momom sis dered ini sopa?"" (Are you aware that I found this language of yours on the 'sopa'?)
> Me: ""Istsi sunus sopa? Roor goonoog non ses isi dodod lel boddob reder gooloog."" (What is a 'sopa'? That word does not exist in my language."" 

From here on I will just type what we said translated into English.*

> Him: ""The sopa is a worldwide system of computers and servers connected by data transmission cables. The sopa enables its users to communicate and share files and information with each other over long distances.""
> Me: ""Oh... That.""
> Him: ""The sopa is also where last year I, under a pseudonym, published a manual--much like this one of yours--designed to teach readers how to speak a language invented by me which features only words that are palindromes."" 

Yeah, I thought I was slick copying from the internet back in the early days when you almost always got away with it. And not only did I get caught, it turns out I had accidentally stolen the work of the same professor who gave me the assignment. I had found the manuscript on the net and spent the last four years becoming fluent in this language, the existence of which I had believed no one else could have possibly discovered. The audience had no idea what we were saying; though, they had to have known I was feeling very nervous and embarrassed about something. Sweaty, nervous, and knowing the jig was up, I decided to continue the conversation in hopes that he at least would not let everyone in attendance know what I had done.

> Me: ""So, if 'sopa' means 'the internet', why is not a palindrome?""
> Him: ""Because it's an acronym for 'ses oo pep arapepooses', which means 'You win the prize.""

It turned out the whole assignment had been a trap he set years ago in an attempt to trick some clever-yet-lazy student into not only learning to speak his made-up palindrome language fluently, but also to serve as a school-wide example of how the coming internet boom would soon make the act of plagiarizing material for college assignments all but impossible. I marveled at his genius and or insanity. The man invented an entire language based on an arbitrary and bizarre rule for the sole purpose of an endgame that not only might never occur, but, if seen to fruition, would end up costing him tons of money. The professor, still speaking our secret language, then informed me the SOPA prize was a full-honors recommendation to any university of my choosing, with my whole first year's tuition, housing and supplies paid in full by the professor himself. 

As I stood there trying to pick up my jaw from the floor, he explained everything to the audience--the genesis of his plan, the trials of creating the language, how I fell for the trap, our conversation on stage, and my prize for being the now multilingual butt of his joke. They loved it. Everyone was cheering and a bunch of my friends started chanting my name, which spread over the whole audience. It was one of the greatest moments I had ever experienced. 

After the show ended, the professor took me out to lunch. As we sat there eating a king's feast at a restaurant much fancier than any I had ever seen before, a thought occurred to me. I asked him, ""Did you really plan this whole thing in advance? I mean, is that why you created that language in the first place; or did you create the language, then later on hatch this idea to use it for this assignment?"" He stared at me blankly for a few moments, then replied, ""You can't stop the internet, Steve."" I said, ""Huh? My name's not Steve, it's..."" Before I could finish, his eyes started rolling in the back of his head, and he went into convulsions. 

Panicked, I went over to him to try and help him, not knowing what I should be doing. He stopped convulsing and told me everything was okay--that every once in a long while he would have some kind of fit like that. Right before one happened he would become confused and briefly lose touch with reality; but everything would return to normal after a minute or so. Relieved, I sat down and asked him the question again. He never answered. He just stared out of the window and sipped his wine. 

I thought maybe he was about to have another fit. He just sat there staring off in complete silence, as if I had not been there. After about ten straight minutes of this awkwardness, I started to realize I had been had. This old son of a bitch had been playing games with me. There was no paid tuition. There was no prize at all. This was just some old weirdo with a brain condition that made him fuck with people. I had just been bamboozled by a sociopath who was now sitting across from me pretending I was a ghost. 

I had gotten myself so worked up that I was just seconds away from flipping over the table and screaming obscenities at the crazy asshole. At the last moment, I stopped myself, thinking it better to just walk away than to make things worse by falling into whatever sick endgame he might have planned that involved him using mind-games to make me so angry that I would assault him in public, go to jail, be raped by people in there he paid with cartons of cigarettes, and so on and on.

I found out later that night that all of that was just in my head. Trying to make sense of his bizarre behavior, I had let myself slip into having thoughts even more bizarre than anything I had experienced that day. He came to my dorm at about 9 PM and proved to me that he wasn't just some crazy, old man. He was, in fact, a rapist. And he raped me. Over and over, he raped me. He raped me until I completely blocked out the last four years of my life to ensure I would never remember anything about this hours-long raping. He raped me so hard my brain actually invented a full four year's worth of fake memories to hide this incident behind. And to this day I still can't recall anything that happened to me during those four years; though, I do remember being raped repeatedly on that cold, dark September night. 

Every year on that night I sit outside looking at the moon--wondering if maybe somewhere out there, someone is being raped on the moon, or raped by a moon, or just a good old-fashioned guy named Steve, who had the good sense to take his raping operation to the moon, where cops can't go yet because flying cop cars is a silly thought, and they would use too much fuel to justify their existence. Good for you, Steve. Rape 'em good, boy. Rape 'em for me.

2338,4pzoq,c30d4q0,t1_c3096lg,t3_me5e9,1321485611.0,4,"Exactly. You only have to look at how quickly the Pirate Bay was functioning after the Swedish police seized their servers (almost immediately, they already had mirrors prepared for when it happened) and how effective the (US) court ordered take down of Wikileaks was (in the Julius Bar case) to see how impossible it is to actually stop people hosting websites if they are prepared to defy the courts. 

I read about the Wikileaks thing about 6 hours after the court decision and, although their domain name was not resolving as ordered by the court, I was able to find a mirror and get a copy of the document the judge had taken exception to them releasing (details of clients of a Swiss bank hiding their money in a tax haven) in minutes. 

Despite the enormous amount of money the RIAA and MPAA has spent, The Pirate Bay is still online and still serving torrents (though I think it's rivals have overtaken it in terms of popularity), it's founders are still free and haven't paid any fines and, given that one of them (anakata) has definitely left Sweden, he isn't looking like he's going to be doing so any time soon. 

If even the most notorious proponents and enablers of piracy the world has ever seen were able to openly mock the legal system, for years and still continue to do so after their much publicised trial, I don't think this is going to be the end of it. It'll simply be a crushing legal burden for legitimate sites, run by commercial interests, that won't just defy the courts. 

I don't think this is an attempt to crush the little guy, I think the MPAA and RIAA are just stupid enough to think this will help them in their demented quest to get piracy stamped out and don't care who they piss off in the process (even if the people they are annoying are the ones they are trying to sell stuff to and they are just pushing more people to piracy). 

Personally, I'm already tired of their shit and have decided to stop buying movies before this happened (ironically, I think it was being forced to sit through one of those anti-piracy adverts at the beginning of a DVD I'd bought that made me decide to stop buying them). I'm not planning to stop watching them. I could but, frankly I don't want to and, after the crap the RIAA and MPAA have pulled, I couldn't care less about their rights anymore and am perfectly willing to infringe them if I feel like it. 

Music I still pay for. Buying it's just easier than pirating it. The RIAA seem to have realised that they can't stand in the way of online distribution, and that they are better off finding a sensible way to charge for it, soon enough. The MPAA are probably too late, it's already so easy to download movies illegally that it's hard to see them making a legitimate service that is as easy to use which, given it's always going to cost something, is probably going to be necessary if they are going to get people using it (and so paying for their movies).

Let's say some hormonal teenage girl is a big fan of Justin Bieber. She's such a big fan that she made a video montage of that guy, with one of his songs playing in the background, and uploads it to Youtube. She only gets a few hits, gets called out by two trolls, essentially doesn't earn anything from it. Unfortunately the record company sees it and decides that the use of the song as background music infringes on the copyright. 

In the past, all Youtube has to do is to take down that video; the worst that can happen is that girl's account gets banned or something.

If the law is passed, not only will the girl have to face legal action, but Youtube in entirety would be forced to shut down - including all the big chunks of it that's made of original content - all because of a video that no one really watched.

Because they don't even have to prove it's copyright infringement.  If a company doesn't like your commentary, parody, or criticism of their work, even if it's legal Fair Use of their copyrighted material, they will likely be able to remove it.  Companies have already done this with DMCA takedown requests, but this process will give them more power to do so in more different places.

The other major problem is the existence of a simple process for removing *anything* posted on the web.  In the past, people and companies have spammed frivolous DMCA requests as a filibuster of sorts: to keep content off the web for as long as it takes to sort out all the DMCA requests.  They will be able to use SOPA the same way, but against any website who has any users who so much as link to something that might be questionably Fair Use of your content (i.e. anything on any site with user-generated content).  And not just to remove their content, to remove the entire website if their content isn't pre-censored-out.

Example: Say I posted a link to a parody of a pop song in this comment.  The artist could then shut down *all of Reddit*, forcing search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with Reddit.

If the government can shut down sites with user-generated content that people use for not-so-legal purposes (such as copyright infringement), that choice becomes irrelevant.

The whole idea behind the DMCA is to protect and promote the spreading of information (and music, art, etc.). Just because a site *can* be used for something illegal doesn't mean it should be shut down or punished. That discourages site operators from allowing the free exchange of ideas, information, and media. As it stands now, the onus in the case of copyright is on the owners of the content.

As a society, we have chosen to lean on the side of free speech, because that open exchange is important to us. This is especially true in the age of instant information where cell phones now share in serving the function of traditional journalism. While trying to stop torrents of *The Walking Dead* isn't really a legit reason to call your congressman, forcing providers to ""cover their asses"" by erring on the side of censoring users is fundamentally detrimental to the kind of information exchange that has become pivotal in our world. (If you need examples, two off the top of my head are the overthrowing of governments in the Middle East and the reversal of debit card fees.) Worse yet, instead of allowing providers to handle claims of infringement on their own, the entire site (thus, the entire medium for exchange and expression) can be taken down because of a few people who don't want to pay $10 to see a movie.

I know you weren't necessarily arguing in favor of this legislation, but my point is that it doesn't really matter if reddit or any other site decides to take down something because it threatens its integrity; that's not the issue. We don't want the government restricting an entire medium because entertainment conglomerates are having to navigate a modern world where they don't make as much money as they used to. Pirating media and software is already illegal, and most respectable outfits (like reddit and YouTube) readily comply with legitimate requests with respect to copyright infringement and other illegal activities.

Personally I don't think any bill proposed would have long standing effects on censorship on the Internet, as just shutting down access to the DNS name for a website won't do anything. Virtualization of servers has vastly improved their mobility to move to other physical locations quite easily, which will only improve in the future. I believe with the massive amount of money that is made from websites like Youtube (and even aggregate sites like Reddit) that we would be able to circumvent censorship if we had to. All of this hinges on ISPs being privately owned though, once they are fully controlled by a single organization, be it government or other, that's when censorship can truly work.

It's actually an Austrian pastry that sold well in Danish bakeries (though, I believe the recipe has since been modified for taste), when Austrian bakers were brought in to replace Danish bakers during a strike in 1890.

Lauritz Klitting, a Danish baker who baked danishes, then brought the danish to the States, serving it at the wedding of president Wilson in 1915, as well as cruising around the country teaching (and selling) the recipe to bakers and chefs. He then settled in New York to run a specialized culinary institute, the Danish Pastry Baking School.

It got a further boost when Herman Gertner hired Klitting, for his Gertner's restaurants in Manhattan. Popularity for the pastry soared at this point, with it becoming the go-to treat for anyone on Broadway. Sales were so good, Gertner hired more bakers and converted his restaurant chain to selling pastries wholesale.

While the boon between 1915-1920 was the most influential for danish influence in America, by 1940 it was a household name and household pastry. Proctor and Gamble even promoted some scientific experiments to provide the best danish recipe and baking methods.

As such, when it comes to censorship, societally you can say whatever you want. The reprocussions are less severe, and if you find a group of people who agree with you then even alienation becomes less of a risk (a way that subcultures start).

Mostly I'm embarrassed because the term is so commonly used on Reddit and it's almost cliche to accuse you of it, but your transgression is so glaring there's little else I can do. 

I will address your points, regardless that you did not offer me the same courtesy. You're delusional if you think ""the government can't do anything right"". For instance, look at our military. It's extremely effective, especially in deterring action. It's enormity cannot be understated. Before you mention Iraq and Afghanistan, please consider that these are errors of strategy and policy rather than the military system itself. 

It's very popular these days, if perhaps only on Reddit, to express an anti-government sentiment. This is potentially the one thing that young liberals like myself share with the shrewder conservatives of the modern political discoure. But just 10 or 15 years ago under Clinton the trust in government was much, much higher. You are putting forth a very easy, very simplistic, and extremely exaggerated portrait of our current government. Please stop. 

Lastly, the media companies supporting Protect IP and SOPA are not concerned with the amount of money it will cost to enforce these copyright regulations. Why would they have a reason to care what it will cost? That responsibility will fall on the shoulders of the judges ordering the IPs to be blacklisted and whatever law agencies are performing followup. All the media companies have to do is register a complaint. Moreover, the lobbyists and executives pushing for this legislation aren't looking for a silver bullet-- they are just trying to regain some of their perceived losses. If they make it enough of a pain in the ass, people might buy more songs off iTunes or subscribe to Netflix or actually buy a DVD. I doubt the average Redditor will find much more trouble pirating the latest popular album or movie, but that's not the demographic these laws are targeting. Either that, or the executives are too ill informed to understand the intricacies of the system and have been led to believe it will be as simple as flipping a switch.

Paper quality is also important - but you can get a good effect with cheap printing paper by writing on top of a stack of 10+ paper. Writing on a hard surface really really feels bad. Paper needs a certain softness, padding and 'give' behind it to get a nice flow without pen scratching.

The Dutch: dress poorly, have terrible taste in food, are stingy, culture vultures, honest to a fault, love their bicycles, herring, licorice, windows, are outwardly very tolerant, and extremely pragmatic.

Why do people hate them? Because they don't fuck around. The only taboo in Dutch society is discussing how much money you make. Everything else is fair game.

In this case, it would be nice to be able to do a ""memcached -dump > somehugefile.dmp"" and then load it back in with a ""memcached -load < somehugefile.dmp"".  Maybe you could have a way to limit what gets dumped based on key name regexes or metadata just in case it would be toxic to restore some of the data

2. Developers.  I want to dump the contents of memcached to examine it in a text editor for errors.  Or maybe I am maintaining a site that has to connect to a remote database and it takes FOREVER everytime I have to restart memcached for it to repopulate, so for the love of god why can't I just restore the previous state?

Instead of interpreting things like ""memcached"" as ""memory cache daemon"", it is more natural to interpret them as ""memory cached"", which makes no real sense.

This leads to real confusion when people use phrases like ""to restart each of our memcached instances"", which *sounds* like ""to restart each of our instances that are memcached"", but in fact means ""to restart each of our memcache-daemon instances"".

So if you're thinking of writing a ""hire daemon"" or a ""fire daemon"" or a ""bake daemon"", please be careful how you name it.

Set affinity rules in VMware so that each ESX host is running one VM in cluster A, and one VM in cluster B. Only allow two VMs per ESX host.

Now my thought is that since VMware does transparent page sharing, assuming that both VMs have similar memcached RAM caches, you can have both VMs using the same memory for the cache. This means that you can theoretically use the same bare metal hardware you have now, but have twice as many memcached servers. You can individually reload an entire single cluster, but still have 50% of your memcached servers up, and since you've oversubscribed the existing ones, 50% of the future state is actually 100% of your current state.

I've spent a lot of time and thought energy on the problem of memcache dependent sites like reddit (and a few other sites I've worked on).  On the one hand, developing memcache dependent sites is incredibly easy and requires so little server hardware to operate at crazy volume.  On the other hand, single points of failure are never good, but in a system as large as reddit is, I feel like they should be avoided at all costs.

Like I said, I spent a lot of time thinking about this problem and did eventually arrive at what I feel like is a perfectly acceptable solution.  Keeping in mind that I'm not sure what usage pattern reddit has against memcache or what you guys are doing to partition keys and whatnot, but the site that I was building for had roughly 10% write load against memcached, so the extra cost of writes wasn't significant.  What I wound up doing was writing a thin application that accepted memcache connections, then determined the request type.  Any request that performed a write (SET, CAS, etc.) was reverse-proxied to both the the memcache server *and* a memcachedb server.  Read requests were just immediately reverse-proxied to the memcache server.  

The application had one other killer function: restoring a ""backup.""  Once you had restarted your memcache server, you would issue another command that would request the values from the memcachedb server and set them in memcache.  I didn't finish working on it, but I had planned to do things like have it proxy key expiries against memcachedb (which at the time didn't support key expiration and I don't know if it still does or not), looking at key substrings for command, etc.

A blast of too many requests and it'd start to spill over. At first it was null data, but then I put in a hook to put at least something in there to hunt for.

Then I realized I could timestamp it.
 
Probably not at the same scale. One of the things I coded in, however, was the ability to be warned when it happens, and code to start wiping out entries right as it happened by using the timestamp. Yea, I timestamp the cache entries using an entry that looks strange to some, but I had the ability to do it from the start. Might take a while to run, but as its running from a remote station, targeting and hitting the wipe from when the error started, normal cache can rebuild after whatever timestamp instead of the whole thing whacking the wires on a total rebuild.
 
I built my system from scratch, tho, so I know it's different than yours, but it was because it was all I had to keep a particular client afloat who couldn't afford resources yet was getting slammed with high spike peak traffic during a particular time of the year. It supports a million impressions a day, with peak only within working hours at that during that peak. They just couldn't afford pizza boxes or round-robin or clustering and the back-end SQL was always pegged, this was a solution that I literally just gave them... 

But sometimes it would crash and damn I share your pain.
 
I think my biggest problem was some servers on a switch that was battling the old autosense war with another switch because of some f'd up routing rule or somesuch. But I remember those days of pain: wipe the cache, then omg shit just crawls for hours and hours and there's nothing you can do and you can't even hit the bar so you just sit and wait or watch BSG for an episode. But I have maintenence and ""watch"" scripts that look out for the nulls and bottlenecks and alert, then I can either automate the partial wipes (instead of restarting) by direct memory address or do it manually; I still don't trust the automatic but I let it run when I'm on ""vacation"".",False,False,1323360738.0,20422,1407,1303027954.0,False,False

So ya, just to start things off with this discussion: 

When it comes to films involving this exploration of temporal-alternate-histories, I find this particular film really delves at the heart of what it means to paradoxically forever alter what has been, and what will be. 

The question becomes, when such an event does occur, and when the dinosaur named ""Captain New Eyes"" travels back in time in this film, to alter the intelligence of all dinsosaurs forever, does the universe perhaps divert itself into 2 branching streams of possibility: 

Possibility 1) 
Captain New Eyes travels back in time, and alters the evolution of dinosaurs, intertwining them with human evolution, forever erasing history as we know it, and altering the time-line permanently. 

Possibility 2) 
Or does the universe that we know, the one in which dinosaurs died out long ago continue, perhaps continue, running in parallel side by side with the altered universe in which dinosaurs did not die out -- like a river branching into 2 different directions at once? 

Indeed, I found this film most profound, and I suspect that the name of the heroic dinosaur itself ""Captain New Eyes"" is loaded with multi-textural symbolism that I've only just begun to grasp.

For example, our replication factor(RF) is set to 3, meaning that every piece of data is replicated to 3 machines. When we write out data, we ask for QUORUM level consistency, meaning that the data is written to to at least RF/2 + 1 nodes before the write command is returned.

Additionally, Cassandra supports more complex replication placement strategies. If we were to split our Cassandra cluster into two separate, geographically distant locations, we can define a placement strategy that ensures data integrity without bumping into latency heavily. In this case, we can write out using LOCAL_QUORUM, meaning that the write ensures that it has quorum before it returns, but only in the *local* datacenter.

Pasted from our AWS management console:

Event: instance-reboot
Description: Maintenance software update.

Why Reboot?
In certain situations, instances need to be rebooted automatically by AWS. These situations include applying patches, upgrades or maintenance to the underlying hardware hosting an instance. There are two types of reboot that may be scheduled for your instance: system reboot and instance reboot. System reboots are performed on the hardware supporting your instance. Instance reboots are performed on your instance rather than on the underlying system.
What should I do if my instance is scheduled for a reboot?
No action is required on your part. You can wait for the reboot to occur automatically. However, we recommend that you check your instance after it is rebooted to ensure that your application is functioning as you expected. Your instance will be rebooted after the scheduled Start time and before the End time. Reboot operations usually take 2 to 10 minutes. While you are given a Start and End time during which the reboot will take place, your instance will only be unavailable during the period that it takes to complete the reboot cycle.
If you do not want to wait for a scheduled reboot, we recommend that you take the following action before the scheduled reboot time of an instance.
You can perform the reboot yourself at any time.
After you do this, your instance will no longer be scheduled for reboot.",False,False,False,171,8,1261773547.0,False,False

The college subreddit competition has come to an end. We tracked the growth of 463 college subreddits from August 20 to October 26 and the results were pretty impressive:

Subscribers to all college subreddits grew from 42,957 to 71,423

Traffic to those subreddits grew from 9,375 uniques/32,122 impressions per day to 30,196 uniques/118,943 impressions per day

**Subreddits from 18 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, England, Germany, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Philippines, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, United States, Wales)**

The exact delineation between colleges and universities is hazy and often varies from state to state, but generally to qualify as a university the school must have significant doctorate and/or professional programs and research.  In contrast, ""college"" traditionally refers to 4-year undergraduate liberal arts schools; these schools may also have graduate programs, but such programs are usually small or otherwise insignificant (even if the undergraduate quality is strong).

You will often hear US universities referred to as a ""university system,"" where the the 4-year undergraduate program(s) of the university are *college(s)* under the umbrella of the larger university, along with the associated doctoral and professional colleges.  While universities themselves are not technically colleges, they must by definition include at least one college; thus the term ""college"" is used to refer to all institutions of higher education (both universities and colleges).

Additionally, note that the classification may refer to the historical role of the school, rather than its current definition.  For example, The College of William and Mary is an extremely prestigious school in Virginia that was founded in 1693.  It would have every right to change its name to ""William and Mary University,"" considering its numerous graduate and professional programs and overall academic strength.  However, it chose to retain the term ""college"" due (at least in part) to its history as a primarily undergraduate liberal arts program, as well as the fact that it was one of 9 ""colonial colleges"" founded before the American Revolution.

My alma mater, Virginia Tech (which Reddit will be highlighting on the 22nd), is classified as a university.  In fact, its official name is ""Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"" but ""Virginia Tech"" is much easier to say.  Within the university are many different colleges, such as the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, and The College of Architecture and Urban Studies.  Technically I received my bachelor's degree from ""The Pamplin College of Business of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"" but the question people ask is ""where did you go to college?"" to which I respond ""Virginia Tech.""

TL;DR- All US universities are colleges, but not colleges are universities.  ""College"" is a perfectly acceptable and commonly used term for all 4-year undergraduate institutions, so correcting its use here is inaccurate. ",False,False,False,4810,11038,1316450304.0,False,False

Yes, it bothers me to look at the page style.  Can I verbally explain to you in depth why it affects me?  Probably not.  I don't like the way it looks.  The colors too deep for me.

It does when I have to deal with this shit.
