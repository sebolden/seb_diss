Edit: To build on this, I'd like to explain how this affects me in a personal way.  Months ago I decided that I was going to teach myself how to use Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Illustrator.  /r/photoshopbattles has been my outlet for that since then.  

In the past few months, I have learned a lot and improved my skill quite a bit.  I relied on seeing my upvote/downvote ratio to judge how well I was doing.  In a perfect world, users are supposed to vote based on how well a shop is and not whether or not it made you laugh.  Of course, this isn't always the case as is shown with my frequent Dickbutt shops, but it's still at least a good indicator.  

People can point out things I did wrong, forgot, or need to improve on.  I welcome that.  That is what will make me a better photo editor.  Now while people can still certainly do this, removing the ratio leaves me completely in the dark as to how many people enjoy my shops or thought they were good versus those who didn't.  All I have now is a point total that I couldn't give a shit about.  I don't care about karma.  I care about growing as a photo editor because eventually I want it to lead into something substantial and worthwhile.  Seeing a point total is completely meaningless to me.  

Recently I did some of my best work with a screencap from *2001: A Space Odyssey.*  People loved it.  I had tons of requests for wallpaper sizes and it even became a huge hit in /r/wallpaper.  I can't even tell you how good that makes me feel.  Seeing people enjoy my work is a large reason I stick around here.

When I see downvotes, that tells me there are things I need to improve on.  I no longer have this.  I no longer know what people are thinking about my work unless they say so.  I certainly welcome this but the vast majority of Reddit does not comment at all.  I understand that the votes are fuzzed but like I said, it's still a general indicator.  Seeing people get excited over something I created means far more to me than a point total ever will.

All of this aside, the new system has completely broken the way the weekly photoshop battles work.  The winner is decided solely on the number of upvotes.  Now that nobody can see the ratio, there's nothing stopping from people manipulating the vote so they can be the winner.  This defeats the purpose of having the weekly battle at all.  Downvotes were never counted in these battles but now we will not be able to see what posts are being downvoted.  ",False,False,1403149787.0,270544,68086,1275441461.0,False,True

The sheer existence of ""points"" listed on a comment or post, regardless of up/down vote tallies, can still lead to users seeing a 0 or negative karma and not understanding why people would downvote their posts.

After waiting a few days to see how this change would work out, I've decided to make a post here.

Obviously there's probably been tons of messages sent to you guys, but I'd like to offer my view on this change (which, frankly, isn't that different than the majority of voices in this thread).

I've been using reddit for several years now, and I like the many communities that are here. Being with a group of people that have similar interests really helped to attract me to the site and to use it. There's also a similar interest and reaction to this post: that *mostly* everyone does not like this change. I'd like to pick apart some of the points in the announcement. I might overlook some things and some of my comments my not be exactly correct, but as an average user, I feel that this is what some other users might feel as well.

>""Who would downvote this?"" It's a common comment on reddit...

The first sentence is something that I've seen before **and** after the recent change. Before the change, I don't think I have to give an example of where I've seen these types of comments. Yesterday though, I ran into this comment on /r/NASCAR. The comment is [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/28ojop/stewart_says_larson_will_learn_not_to_block_him/cicxg6y). Also, that sub has had a downvoting problem in the past in race threads, where comments have gone from 1 point to 0. This change doesn't affect the display of points that a comment has, and, if I guess right, these types of comments will still show up from time to time.

Next are the percentages that a submission shows. Now, I don't mind (and after reading through a small amount of the comments here, neither do a percentage -- no pun intended -- of the users) the hidden amounts of votes that a link/text post shows. However, that number and percent can be easily be misread. For example, this submission has a 50% approval rate with -128 points (let's just say 0 points). Now, I'm going to echo the concerns of comments: how do we know the size of the audience that has read this post? Is it 2 people that have upvoted this and 2 people that have downvoted, or is it 10,000 upvotes and 10,000 downvotes showing that many more people have voiced their opinions than my first example. Other people have also voiced concern over the vote percentage being manipulated and other things, but they're discussed more in depth than I can wrap my head around.

Those are the first two thoughts that come into my mind when I tried to type this out. Obviously, more redditors have more thoughts and concerns regarding this change and may explain things better than me.

I have no doubts that when going through these changes, everyone on the admin team thought that this was a good change. **And I can see that**. However, not everything works out like it does when first planned. As others have said, this change affected /r/PhotoshopBattles' flair ranking system. Now a user may not get, let's say, a 1k flair because others downvoted their comment.

I see this as a change for the worse, because the magnitude of reaction to a post should be transparent to users. As others have said, 1 upvote / 1 downvote is a very different thing than 100 upvotes 100 downvotes.

Also, a 2000 / 100 split is very different than a 20/1 split.

Having a massively upvoted comment is a really neat reward that motivates users with a feeling of great appreciation. ""82% like it"" doesn't have the same impact. I suspect that screwing with this incentive will change the economy of information here in a negative way. It'll feel dead. A musician wouldn't feel nearly as rewarded by ""82% clapped"" than by ""1000 people clapped"". It's like playing to a void. Not getting feedback.

If feedback for vote gaming is such an issue, why not just take a cue from /r/politics and hide scores temporarily, when the submission is fresh? Delayed feedback is still good enough for real users to feel appreciated.

Title: ""[Please revert the concealing of upvotes/downvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/28tw7m/please_revert_the_concealing_of_upvotesdownvotes/)""

Contents: 

[This announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/) has officially hit 0, making it the *only* announcement that has ever been downvoted to zero. It is down from the [1890 points](https://i.imgur.com/R6BD1ZB.jpg) I screencapped it with on June 18th. 

With *over 9,000* more comments than any other announcement, Redditors commenting on the post have spoken with near unanimous consensus against this change.

In the announcement, it is said that individual upvotes and downvotes (that could be shown through [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/)) should not be displayed because fuzzing makes the numbers inaccurate. *This ignores the fact that the points we see now are also not accurate because of fuzzing, making the argument from the announcement illogical.* It is insinuated in the announcement that this measure will prevent the question, ""Who would downvote this?"" from what I have seen, it does not. It merely conceals any upvote support there may on downvoted comments. 

Let it also be noted that this action of removing upvotes/downvotes was done without consulting the user base first. Nor did the announcement ask for community opinion of the change afterwards. This has worried many people. I strongly suggest that the Admins revert this change, at the very least, to restore trust of a considerable number of users who feel disenfranchised. I suggest that the Admins ask the community for suggestions of how to fix the perceived problem laid out in the announcement. ",False,False,False,30703,218897,1349332560.0,False,True

A lot of the time, most or all of those upvotes would have been fake ones added by the site. The fuzzing was not only at high numbers of votes, it could start on the very first vote.

You are not fixing anything here, you're just concealing information. **The numbers still aren't accurate.** I mean, if it's not worth seeing the number of upvotes/downvotes because they aren't accurate, why should we be allowed to see the points we see now? They aren't accurate either. You're not preventing people from asking why their comment has downvotes. Having a downvoted comment and not being able to see any support does not make me ""feel"" any better.

Also, you're seriously going to claim that when I saw an unpopular comment in a small subreddit with 27 downvotes and no upvotes, with 3 comments of negative feedback under it - you are going to claim that the community had no demonstrable effect on that comment? Nonsense. 

What you need to do is change things back (to bring back trust to this website at the very least) and then come up with a reasonable alternative to the fuzzing system.

It's the government and corporations that benefit from this, Reddit is nothing more than a hollowed out shell of its old self, a PR agency that touts itself as the Front Page of the Internet, a bastion of democracy when in fact it just does PR for governments and corporations, a task they just got a lot better at.

I think it's clear that this change has not been received well and it has only left the community frustrated and confused about the change.

These are the contents of the post:

Title: ""Redditors have spoken - the last announcement has been downvoted from 1890 points to 0 points.""

Text: 

[This announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/) has officially hit 0, making it the *only* announcement that has ever been downvoted to zero. It is down from the [1890 points](https://i.imgur.com/R6BD1ZB.jpg) I screencapped it with on June 18th. 

With *over 9,000* more comments than any other announcement, Redditors have spoken with near unanimous consensus against this change.

In the announcement, it is said that individual upvotes and downvotes that were shown by [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) should not be displayed because fuzzing makes the numbers inaccurate. *This ignores the fact that the points we see now are also not accurate because of fuzzing, making the argument from the announcement illogical.* It is insinuated in the announcement that this measure will prevent the question, ""Who would downvote this?"" It does not. It merely conceals any upvote support there may on downvoted comments. 

The Admins of this site can still reverse the change, but damage has already been done. This action made by admins, done without consulting the user base or asking for community opinion, will leave a permanent scar that will not be forgotten. By refusing to listen to their users, the Admins have built a wall between them and their user base.

First off, I dislike the change. But that's not my main problem. My main problem is Reddit's stated policy of ignoring the users and hoping they just get over it.

I've loved Reddit in large part because it seems to listen to its users and respond to them. The admins are part of the community. This is as opposed to something like Facebook, where it's run as a dictatorship -- the corporate machine is very frank about making the changes that suit their own purposes, and the users are expected to get over it. They have a large enough userbase that even if a portion of it leaves because of the change, it's barely worth noticing.

Reddit seems to have correctly judged that their userbase is large enough to do the same thing. Some users may leave, but by and large this will just be a blip on the radar. I'll probably keep using Reddit myself.

[This announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/) has officially hit 0, making it the *only* announcement that has ever been downvoted to zero. It is down from the [1890 points](https://i.imgur.com/R6BD1ZB.jpg) I screencapped it with on June 18th. 

With *over 9,000* more comments than any other announcement, Redditors have spoken with near unanimous consensus against this change.

In the announcement, it is said that individual upvotes and downvotes that were shown by [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) should not be displayed because fuzzing makes the numbers inaccurate. *This ignores the fact that the points we see now are also not accurate because of fuzzing, making the argument from the announcement illogical.* It is insinuated in the announcement that this measure will prevent the question, ""Who would downvote this?"" It does not. It merely conceals any upvote support there may on downvoted comments. 

The Admins of this site can still reverse the change, but damage has already been done. This action made by admins, done without consulting the user base or asking for community opinion, will leave a permanent scar that will not be forgotten. By refusing to listen to their users, the Admins have built a wall between them and their user base.

I disagree with this change and I am actively participating in voicing this opinion through the following message being sent around: 

Please write to the mods about the changes concerning upvote/downvote tallys. You can do so by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com). A default message you can use is:

>“As an active member of the reddit community, I do not agree with the changes stated in [the recent announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/). I believe that this change is disruptive to the reddit experience and diminishes quality from smaller subreddit communities. Please reinstate explicit comment vote tallies, at least leaving it as an option for subreddits.”


  


**There is no widely subscribed-to subreddit for making general self posts**, therefore we may have to rely on this “chainmail” like communication system to get a large response from redditors. Please forward this to as many redditors as you feel comfortable (5-10 maybe?). A good pool to draw from might be [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/) announcement thread, but note that top level commenters may have already received this message. Note: as far as I can tell, this does not violate the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/). Also try to raise involvement through any smaller subs you are part of!

This has to be done today before people give up and settle into the new system!

First, by focusing not on the votes themselves but ""67% like it"", the direct implication is that votes are based on likes or dislikes.  Of course, this has just about always been true for submissions regardless of rediquette, by the nature of what a submission is, so while it is troubling, it's not terrible by itself.

But you have also revamped controversial sorting. Now, unless you have some kind of AI that reads all the comments and determines that they are controversial, I assume you are doing this by vote counts, and (hopefully) comment counts (and maybe the vote counts on the comments). And the problem there is that the definition of controversial is that something is both liked and disliked by a lot of people, enough that they will argue about it. So once again, the implication is that a vote is for how much you like or dislike the content of a comment, not the validity of the contribution.  Of course I could be entirely wrong about what defines a controversial post in your new sorting method, but I think it's safe to say that lots of people will still make this inference even if it isn't accurate.

On the bright side, most people have been using the downvote button as a dislike button all along, so at least now we can stop pretending and just accept that the lowest scores will be not for the useless posts, but for the unpopular opinions.  Which means you should probably change ""best"" sorting to be called ""most liked"" or ""most popular"".  After all, if I understand correctly, ""best"" has something major to do with the upvote:downvote ratio as well as number of votes (which is great under the old system of rediquette, not so great now that it will just display the hivemind opinion).",False,False,False,133863,28396,1187370614.0,False,False

After reading some comments here, the are Subreddits with defmods etc. Why didn't you told nobody about this change?! If you announced this to the public, you would see, most of us all have doubts that this change is really helpful! 

Everybody who knows a little of reddit knew: I can see how many people liked/disliked me. This openmind thinking, I loved that, and this feature are you killing?

Yes, this post is the most downvoted announcement since 2011. And do 63% of people like this change? Almost certainly not; I suspect most of these upvotes are for visibility rather than anything else.

People are obviously taking the ""like"" in ""% like it"" to heart when it comes to this stuff. That's always been the case, of course, but [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) *specifically* says not to downvote a post if you don't like it. I guarantee that if this text was changed to ""% think this is a good topic for discussion"" that the practice of using downvotes to signify dislike would change. Seriously, Reddit, don't give us mixed messages here. (For the record, I upvoted this post for visibility, not like.)

---
Last week, as I am sure you are away, the reddit admins made an extremely controversial change to how submission and comment scores are displayed, and the community has rallied together demanding these changes be rolled back.

These changes were made last Wednesday, and now, nearly a week later, there has been no official response as to where this monstrosity stands. Are there any intentions to inform the community on where things stand, and if there is any possibility of this change being rolled back, as many people wish to see happen (as evidenced by the first announcement in reddit history to ever end up with negative total score, currently ranking in at roughly -300 points, and almost 15,000 comments, mostly in opposition to the change).

I am aware that the admins have privately mentioned to various users that ""changes are being considered"", but I would urge you to roll back these changes until a proper (and acceptable) course of action can be decided on, and to actually involve the community before making such a fundamental change that breaks core functionality of the website.

My last message to the admins (mod mail to mods at /r/reddit.com) received no response. That message is available here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/cicjwp1

Hopefully the vast amount of negativity surround this recent change is being noticed. If the supposed goal of the change was to make reddit appear less negative, it has been a massive failure. The original announcement asked people to give the change a few days and see if it felt better. It has been almost a week, and it doesn't feel better. Hopefully when that statement was made, it was a sign that the admins do actually care what the community thinks and it wasn't just a pr statement to appear to be open to changing things if the community ended up hating the change.

Looks like the API isn't returning **any** information about down votes at all, will have to look at this further but at face value this seems like a useless change, Reddit is now redundantly returning 0 down votes for everything and not divulging how many down votes something actually has.

If there's no way to view downvotes from the api on sub listings then they did this so that third party clients can't show downvotes at all. If I wanted to use Facebook, I would have gone to facebook.com.

Yes, people are complaining. But it's been working. The community is still growing. It's not like people are leaving the community in droves.

The open nature of the numbers--even if they are a bit innacurate--is an important differentiator from other community sites on the internet. Once people get the gist of how the numbers are working, and especially once they know about the vote fuzzing thing, it gets them even more involved. It helps us feel like this is 'our' site. I click the upvote button and actually see my little contribution increase the rating. It makes my vote feel like it's mine and it matters--even if it doesn't so much. As far as loyalty is concerned, it's the feeling that's important.

This change will make it easier for new users, but it's also going to make it more like all the other sites out there. I'm guessing It's also probably going to reduce the amount of Reddit gold given. People like to like things other people like. I'm more likely to give gold on a post that I see is widely appreciated by everyone. If I gave gold only when something specifically struck *me*, I'd probably never give gold. I need to see just how much everyone else loves what they said.

I'm going to stick around. But my guess is that without being able to see the votes, I'm going to start feeling lost and I'm probably going to stop voting. And differentiating reasons for coming to Reddit are probably going to dissipate, and eventually I'll just be going somewhere else that's making me feel at home.

I'm not happy about this change, Reddit. The upvotes and downvotes are a big part of your identity (I'm talking to you, *Reddit*.

You are wrong. This is only true for submissions/comments with *many* votes. Submissions/comments with fewer votes never had this issue, and in small subreddits the vote counts were habitually sufficiently accurate to be useful.

On small subreddits, I relied on those counts to get a feel for how a post/comment was being received. There was valuable information there. There's often a big difference between a post/comment that is (2|1) and one that is (66|33). And now that information is gone.

The way I understand it is that submissions will not show the number of up/downvotes, but will show a percentage of people who upvoted it, in addition to the total score. Comments will show total score and that's it. Correct?

I'm going to ignore the submissions part of this, because frankly I don't care. What I do care about is the comments.

From reading the comments here, these seem to be the three problems people have with it:

1. You have no idea how many people interacted with your comment. If you're sitting at 5 points, that could mean four people saw it and upvoted it, or it could mean hundreds upvoted it and hundreds downvoted it. There's no way to tell the difference.
2. You have no idea what the general reception was. As people have pointed out, a comment with (6|1) is very different than a comment with (1006|1001).
3. Some people use the voting system for other things, such as polls or voting in contests.

The solution for point 2 is quite obvious: Put a percentage on the comments as well. A comment with (6|1) would show 86% and a comment with (1006|1001) would show 50%. When I first read this post, this is what I thought it meant, and I didn't think it was absolutely horrible.

The solution for point 1 is quite simple as well, something I found while reading through this thread: [Show a fuzzed total number of votes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/cib1ukc) A comment with (6|1) would show something like <10, whereas a comment with (1006|1001) would show something like >1000 or >2000.

The third problem I don't really have a good solution for. I guess you could maybe implement a new kind of ""poll"" post in addition to links and selfposts. Or you could maybe allow mods to see the total number of votes, so they can use that to see the winner. Neither of these are great, though.

But in the end, that's an awful lot of work to put in just to remedy this one change. The much easier option would be to just put back the numbers.

Like so many of my fellow redditors have mentioned, you're killing smaller subreddits, and other subreddits like /r/vexillology, which hold contests based solely on the number of upvotes that a post gets. 

And even so, a little warning would have been nice. One of the greatest things a team of admins can do for the people using their service is to communicate with them, and not doing so is one of the easiest ways to get them to leave. Already, people are looking for alternatives to Reddit, and looking into making their own competing website. Is this what you want?

The main reason why I love Reddit is because it is a wonderful forum for discussion, in which you could tell how many people agreed or disagreed with you in the form of clear numbers. If you get a ton of upvotes, keep doing what you're doing. If you get a ton of downvotes, stop. If you get about the same number of upvotes and downvotes (which is the real point of contention here), then it all comes down to how large the individual upvote and downvote totals are in deciding whether people care a lot about what you've posted, or just kept scrolling down the webpage. While I get that your new algorithm accounts for this, you're cutting the head off the entire body of Reddit, because the people who are actually doing the posting and keeping this wonderful thing alive won't know how to do so.

Day two of the change and I still hate it. Gonna keep informing you of my progress on trying to accept this awful change. /r/tennis is one of the best subreddits on the web. We have a nice small dedicated community with excellent mods and this is screwing it up. We like to know if and when tennis fans are around and what they are thinking. Now with no way to check up/downs, we have no idea if there are 5 people participating or 100. Wimbledon is coming up really soon and this change is going to make the best part of Reddit for me a worse experience as well as the rest of the users in that group. 

I gotta wonder wtf you guys did this and why if you were going to do this you did it in such a terrible way from a PR standpoint. Was it like the person that said this was to stop showing downvotes on Reddit ads claimed? Because if so that really sucks. You could have just disabled votes on ads and left this all alone. Managing to piss off your subscribers and then saying things like you knew people would hate it but that would not be the reason you would roll it back seems to me to be pure idiocy.   

I understand that you personally  /u/Deimorz did not do this all on your own and are just the target that is being offered by the admins. I mod a couple small subs that this will affect in a negative way and I want to know if and or why the small subs were not considered when you guys decided to do this. Like a lot of redditors, I started out reading the defaults and now 2+ years later I participate mostly on the smaller ones that specifically interest me. The longer term subscribers here are the ones you guys are messing with and honestly I can't figure out why anyone thought this was a good idea.

So many others have already pointed out the many problems with how the change was made (no warning, no testing, no input from users, etc) and the actual change itself that it doesn't feel necessary to restate them.  

It doesn't help that there's almost no response from you guys.  I dislike the mod's statement elsewhere that this is just a ""knee-jerk reaction.""  That's dismissive and insulting.

Personally, I don't care as much about the vote numbers on posts, but the comment numbers were an integral part of my reddit using experiences.  Yes, I use RES, and I think, judging by the comments here, maybe a lot more people use RES than you thought.  

I can go to any site and see a stream of stuff, but the comments are where the community happens and the vote tallies are important to that.  Everybody's saying it.  There's a big difference betweeen a 5 point comment that is 6|1 and one that is 1005|1000.  It tells us what is controversial, what is seeing a lot of traffic, it's important for contests, and shows when brigading is happening.  And yes, we know those numbers aren't exact, that they're ""fuzzed"", but it's close enough.

I've been on reddit for over 2 years and finally bought some gold credits last week.  I have always enjoyed using the site and wanted to show my support, as well as have an extra way to show my appreciation to those comments that made me laugh (or to my favorite shops in /r/photoshopbattles ).  Now I kind of regret doing that because, if you don't change this back and you've said you won't, I don't feel like supporting the site any more, and will definitely start spending my time elsewhere.

Do the admins have any intention to acknowledge that this recent change is unwanted, and something the community wishes to see rolled back? The change is being received about as well as the Xbox One's original drm scheme.


I am aware that in responses to other redditors, you have cited the cryptic ""59% of redditors have upvoted the announcement thread"", and using this to claim that they must support the change. This is flawed logic, with an example of the flaw being here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/cicazhv

While a downvote most certainly is a protest against the policy, an upvote can potentially be to bring visibility to the thread rather than a sign of support. Also worth mentioning, the only poll circulating right now:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H5_e-fZP9nWFQFHa9fIA6c6mrWcM1XOkFf7yNz_R5lo/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm

is showing an extremely disproportionate percentage of the member base hating this change, with almost 90% of respondents (over 10k people) saying they dislike the change.

The initial announcement asked people to give the change a few days and see if it feels better. It has been a few days, and the change is still awful, and it is still viewed that way by the vast majority of the community. It is time for the admins to realize their mistake, and revert the site to how it was on Monday morning.

this is the address to send your message to:

http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com

i would highly suggest that everyone not confine their outrage about this change to this thread, take your messages to the reddit admins directly. don't let them bury their heads in the sand and ignore a single thread. just keep your messages professional and don't get involved in name calling rants.

after a few days of sitting with this, here's my two cents:

I'm a casual daily user.  I don't get crazy about tallying karma points or anything, but I do like to have input on a number of different conversations, whether it's in /r/askmen or /r/Axecraft or any other excellent l'il subreddit.  I make between 0 and 4 comments a day, and fully expect to see no more than 3 karma points per comment.  But everynow and then I'll have one go ""bonkers"" and get me 8 or 10 points... I like to see that.  I also like to see, on a day when I've made a high # of comments, that if I've gotten a karma increase of 5 points, which comments that karma is coming from.  

that's huge.  w/o that kind of feedback, quite honestly, it seems I care less about tracking which comments hold value.  If I've got no incentive, or indicator, to go see which ones are  ""hot"", i'm not going to go into them and continue the conversation.  

it seems silly to have what is essentially a point scoring system, and then not let the players know which ""plays"" earn the big scores.  just silly.

All of the initial criticisms still hold true. It makes it more difficult to judge how content is received in the smaller subs. And frankly it's just annoying.

I think the general consensus is still that this change is far more annoying than the vote fuzzing was initially. And in this instance, the annoyance is generally from established users, whereas people seemed to get over the vote fuzzing issue once they become aware it existed.


I would ask that you consider, if not rolling back the change outright, then at least making a rollback optional by subreddit under control of each subreddit's mod team. Or rolling back the change universally for subreddits below a certain size.

I appreciate that this is a major change which has taken a lot of effort, and that any alterations or reversals will likewise take major time and effort. I get that you don't want to go through that, that there is a monetary side to this as well.

***Comment 2:***

*Karma: 2*

In your new system, both comments would say about 50% like it, but look at the different levels of interaction they inspired. 18 users on one, and 800 on the other. That is much more important to a lot of people than getting a large swing of upvotes and having a high total.

This will do nothing but encourage circlejerk comments to either get mass upvotes (crowd pleasing) or mass downvotes (trolling).


And it wasn't 'mostly' an illusion at all - don't patronise us, a lot of users knew how it worked and took that into consideration when using it to form conclusions.

eg. For small communities who don't get thousands of voters, the up/down ratio is extremely useful. If a link has 5 upvotes and 3 downvotes, it will look much different to another link that got 2 upvotes - despite having the same 'karma', fuzzing or not.

For example in my sub there is a link that has 1 karma. Yesterday I knew that it had a decent amount of up and downvotes. Today it just looks like no one voted at all.

What a reckless change this is, and based on your fluffy explanation, /u/Deimorz, it has had very little consideration. Absolutely outrageous.

Personally, I agree with everyone else in saying this is not a good way to combat the fuzzing problems Reddit. Not to mention this has a been a core feature that people associate and enjoy about Reddit. And as a RES user, I like seeing how people view my comments both positive and negative. Even if there is a possibility of people screwing with the votes for no good reason.  

Back to fuzzing, having percentages could make fuzzing even worse now. Since all people would have to do is downvote/upvote a post/comment early on to effect it's percentage.  

On top of all of that, since this is all based on percentages. The number of people needed to artificially bury or inflate a post/comment early on can be drastically reduced. Making it easier to amass people to help with their shady endeavors. Since a group of 10-20 people (maybe even less) would be needed to effect the percentages of a submission early on.  

With viewing upvote/downvote numbers, it obvious to some Redditors when a post or comment is getting artificially effected by a upvote/downvote brigade. Not to mention, people just like seeing the number of people who have at least interacted or seen their post.  

Here is a great way to look at the whole situation. Say if take a test and submit it. Test are normally graded by percentages. While that is a great way to get the final accumulative grade for entire class worth of someones work. But myself and others (i assume) around here like to see what number of question and/or problems that got right or wrong on the test. It helps us know where we are going wrong or what we are doing right. Seeing just the percentages give a disconnect that makes it harder to gauge what was right or wrong. Since they are only seeing the broad picture without the finer details.

All in all, this current change in my opinion is not the way change things around here. But just the same, I'll do as you say and give it a few days to see if my opinion changes.

Don't get me wrong: I love this site. I don't want to leave. But, you're taking away 30% of the reason I choose to navigate to reddit in the first place. The other 70% is pretty available elsewhere on the internet, as well..

why not just show un-fuzzed numbers? why is that so much harder? You have an engine pumping the upvotes when a suspected downvote bot attacks.  When you figure you have an algorithm to spot a downvote bot, and an algorithm used by your upvote bot to offset the damage then you literally have both algorithms needed to provide this a fairly accurate set of un-fuzzed numbers.

The change to the way posts are up/downvoted seems to affect some small subreddits, but it's not hard to manually calculate an estimate from the percentage and total scores, so in a way, it's an improvement because of the reduced ""fuzziness"" of the values.

The comment up/downvote hiding, on the other hand, feels utterly arbitrary and without purpose. It's a system that nobody has ever had a problem with (aside from the occasional ""why is this getting downvotes"" whining, but such complaints will always be prevalent on a site with a voting system), and with one huge sweeping change, suddenly it's denied to everyone no matter what, because *reasons*.

My only guess is because the ""fuzziness"" system has been adjusted, and in a knee-jerk reaction, the devs kludged away the ability to see up/downvotes on posts because of some overriding terror of bots somehow abusing the new system and farming internet karma, which has literally no actual value whatsoever.

But couldn't this just be solved by employing a system like many other websites. For example how youtube automatically checks and determines if views, ratings and subscribers are actually legit?  

Isn't there a chance that this could increase the prevalence of botting? If a botter can't see that their effect is very slight (if there is any effect at all) then it stands to reason that they would continue botting until there is what they believe to be an effect. I don't go a day where I don't see the reddit page couldn't load page thing (the one where Snoo is dying under all the upvotes). If increased bot activity, because of botters trying even harder because they can't see they are not having an effect, causes more traffic to the site this could cause pages to load incorrectly even more often.
  
While I can fully understand the reasons behind this decision it just seems that this is a fix for a problem caused by a lack of a reliable solution. Of course I don't know the ins and outs of how reddit is run, honestly I'm just going by what I have learned from a friend who works for a pretty big business where I live.  

It would be great to receive a response. More so because if I'm wrong in any way then you can help me learn. It would make a stark contrast to reddit impeding my ability to learn.

Reddit has a problem with bot voting.  And it's Reddit's job to fix it by detecting the perpetrators rather than vote rigging. 

More to the point, display the user names of who up votes and who down votes posts. The jig is up if new accounts consistently up or down vote. Moreover, the evidence of a sycophants or malcontents immediately becomes obvious right along with the sociopaths who simply downvote or upvote merely to wipe their feces on the wall.

It gives a false impression of the reason people upvote things, a news post about Destiny making PS4/XboxOne 30fps to give all systems the same experience isn't being upvoted because people like that news but because people want to share that news.

This is a prevalent issue on youtube and I would not want it to very slowly seep into reddit as it grows a more casual userbase through larger and larger recognisability. You see many things on youtube acquire thumbs down simply because people dislike the content of the video as opposed to people realising that spreading the video is important. If this were to occur on reddit it would greatly undermine the good things that come from news people in fact dislike being upvoted.

I don't have a positive suggestion for what the reworded change should be, but I do feel it's an important consideration to have as it's a visible issue in more mainstream sites, as reddit continues to grow I can see it's potential to become an issue.

I do want to point out one thing. I moderate several smaller subreddits, including /r/SF_Book_Club. Our users nominate and vote on a book that we read each month, and we mods tally up all the votes then pick a book.

In the past, we've counted total votes towards a book to stop people downvoting books they don't want to read. So a book with 10 upvotes and 5 downvotes will get selected over a book with 10 upvotes and 1 downvote. 

We can't do this any more because of this new change. That's fine, we'll find a way to cope.

The easiest way for us to cope, though, would be if we could select to have downvotes turned off in the comments of certain threads. **For instance, if putting a thread into ""contest mode"" killed the downvoting code** in addition to randomizing the comment view. We currently implement this in our custom CSS, but of course people just don't use that and get to downvote anyway. 

Anyway, we're a tiny community (~4,000 users) and our need is probably unique. This is and should be a low priority issue. But I wanted to point it out to you all anyway.

We don't need that one post to show ""95% liked"" to understand, when the whole system is being modified with the same algorithm. Having vote totals provides us with a better way to interpret data since they are all in the same ""fuzzing"" system.

The upvote/downvote count on the comments is important, and it baffles me that you reddit admins would contest this. You can't possibly be this clueless, so let's just benevolently call this a failed experiment and move on.

* RES had some fairly nice features for interacting with counts. That's over.
* It used to be possible to tell, ""oh crap, that post is being seen WAY more negatively than I'd thought, I should delete it before my karma tanks."" That's impossible now (I've only had this happen once when everyone pig-piled on a rant of mine) as one up-vote and two down-votes is the same as 1000 up-votes and 2000 down-votes.
* On a per-subreddit basis, vote count was one way to know how active the sub was. Lots of comments with few votes is a symptom of a hyper-active but tiny audience.
* I can't be sure (only Reddit can, now) but I expect this will lead to more heavy down-voting and much more volatile per-subreddit karma. That's an issue for people like me who take part in debate subs where most people use downvote (incorrectly) as a ""disagree"" button. It's trivial in these subs to become post-throttled already.

Seeing individual votes had drawbacks like bandwagonning. Or just feeling nit-picky about votes, for example seeing 2 downvotes in a debate with 2 other people it's easy to assume they are the ones downvoting you.

But removing it makes people feel ""blind"". Clearly part of that is just the consequence of an adjustment period, but it will likely not go away entirely.

I think vote counts shouldn't be simply removed. It should be replaced with a metric that makes more sense.

So the question is: Why do people care about vote counts? People feel blind, but blind from what exactly? Maybe you should start to show that ""% upvoted this"" or something similar, that's fuzzy.

All it is doing is making you readjust your scales and a small part of your reddit experience.  People are scared of change, but I really do think this one is for the better. 

After the first time reading through this I thought this was a genius idea, because it is.  It is solving one of the biggest problems of reddit which is too much group think.  People tend to upvote what is already popular and tend to downvote on what is already getting hated on.  It makes for a single mind and a limited perspective on a website that was made to do the exact opposite.  Reddit was made to draw people from all types of backgrounds to focus on and discuss interesting ideas and to further explore niches.  When the hive mind attempts to change new redditors to fit their ways, we lose some of that individualism and only start commenting the same type of comments that get lots of upvotes.

I think this change will help improve the quality of content we see on reddit, and I'm excited for it.  With less people caring about the numbers, a lot more attention will be given to content which is why most of us are here.  

As for the people upset about this change in the smaller subreddits, I think most of the problems will be solved in time.

Personally, I think that this change will invite voting based on the content and quality of the submissions and comments, instead of some people just voting due to controversial situations such as feeding the reddit circlejerk, or even witch hunting. 

If I recall correctly, a subreddit's ability to do this (at least in the comments) has been optional for a while now.

I believe we could fix this corrupted system into a well tailored one by having the developers create a system where the people with higher successful posts have more down votes.

People no longer have an endless supply of down votes, and they can only use, say, 24 per day. 1 per hour, so people will use them sparingly rather than down voting everything willy-nilly.



Going back to my earlier suggestion of completely eliminating downvotes may not entirely be a bad idea. If people only have the option of up voting, then bad content won't get upvoted, where good content will. Simple as that.

This is incorrect! You don't have that information!

If you have been basing your post of the week on information that *is not correct*. You've been extrapolating from fuzzy data, and potentially giving prizes away to people who don't deserve it.

This change should be a wakeup call to systems like yours; while your intentions are *fantastic* (seriously, I love the idea) it's not actually something that you can realistically *do*. The information you have been using is just made up fuzzy information. If it's as far off as indicated in the example that /u/Deimorz gave, then it's almost completely useless.

To give an example that might pertain more to your situation, consider two posts, and what they look like before and after this change:

* b: (255 | 55) a: 200 points
* b: (236 | 10) a: 226 points

In your old system, the top link would likely win; in the new system, the second vote would likely win. This seems like a major change, but here's the reality; we have no idea how many upvotes either of these got. The only piece of information we specifically know is that *the upvotes that are listed are incorrect due to vote fuzzing*.

So the way you have been running contests has been specifically using information that is *necessarily* incorrect.

I think that this change is in large part dedicated towards making people understand that you can't use reddit as an accurate voting tool.

I think that one possible thing that the admins could do to get around this would be to legitimately disallow downvoting in a subreddit, but as it has been said many times that voting up *and* down are integral to how reddit works, I doubt that this would happen.

I hope that you can get behind using points instead of upvotes; personally I don't think this is a massive change, but it's certainly one that could take some adjusting to.

Think about it: with the vote-fuzzing, the up and downvote numbers were fairly inaccurate anyway. If a post had 100 upvotes and 20 downvotes, there's no way to determine whether those downvotes were made by actual people, or whether they were all added by reddit to combat bot-spam.

So in essence, the numbers were fairly meaningless anyway, were they not?

**Edit:** from the admins' original post:

>since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion

What reddit *should* do is completely remove karma, so there's no more stupid ""competitions"" to be the person with most karma, or ""jokes"" about karma whoring.

From this post: 

>I realize that this probably feels like a very major change to the site to many of you, but since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion. Please ***give it a chance for a few days*** and see if things ""feel"" better without being able to see the specific up/down counts.

So he's implying that if we don't like it after a few days, they'll change it back?

>There's not really any point in me yelling into the storm in /r/announcements. This wasn't a change that we made lightly, and ***it's not going to be reverted due to the (completely expected) knee-jerk reaction to it***. We're reading the feedback about it, and some things may end up being changed eventually, but not immediately.

His justification is essentially ""Once everyone stops complaining about the changes we made, they'll like it.""


And he says 

>This change may also have some unexpected side-effects on third-party extensions/apps/etc. that display or otherwise use the specific up/down numbers. We've tried to take various precautions to make the transition smoother, but please let us know if you notice anything going horribly wrong due to it.

But in another post

>If it's any consolation, I fucked all of my own bots as well and just finished scrambling around editing PRAW in about 20 different places.

So you tried to make the transition smoother, but had to scramble to fix your own bots? Sounds to me like this change was a ""knee jerk reaction"".

You could add a fuzzed amount of total votes to comments, for example. So if we see ""Comment, 0 points, >100 votes"", we know it's highly controversial compared to ""Comment, 0 points, <5 votes"".

Starting from [the math in your post](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/cib1yfd), I simplified the formula in Wolfram|Alpha. In the formula I developed, s=score (in points), p=percent liked (as a number from 0 to 100), and the formula returns d=downvotes and u=upvotes.

Using your example of a score of 3,196 points that 79% liked, [we'd set this formula up in Wolfram|Alpha with s=3196 and p=79](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=s%3D3196%2C+p%3D79%2C+d%3DRound%28%28%28100-p%29s%29%2F%28abs%282p-100%29%29%29%2C+u%3Dd%2Bs).

In this paticular case, Wolfram|Alpha returns the answer: d=1157, p=79, s=3196, u=4353. Since you set p and s in the formula, you can ignore them. Since u=4353 and d=1157, this tells you that the post received roughly 4,353 upvotes and 1,157 downvotes, just as in your example!",False,False,False,33915,33948,1170295435.0,False,True

It means the displayed vote counts were not perfectly accurate, so that spam bots couldn't be sure if they were having any effect. It confused many people who saw that their posts were being downvoted, because many, if not most, of those downvotes were not real.

2) It means that the false vote numbers were the ones used to calculate the percentages, so once fuzzing kicked in, it wouldn't be accurate about what percentage of redditors upvoted it.

3) Now they are using (more) accurate vote counts to calculate the percent of redditors who have upvoted any particular post. I believe the points are still being fuzzed, at least somewhat, but now the percentages are more accurate to the general attitude toward a particular post.

4) RES is a browser extension/add-on called Reddit Enhancement Suite. It adds some excellent functionality to reddit. Once of those extras was that it would show the upvote/downvote ratios on posts and comments in a convenient (up|down) format. Now reddit is no longer providing the information to show those. It has been replaced by the percentages for posts, but no such accommodation has been made for comments. This is the main reason people are upset.

*No, don't apologize for that!*

Seriously, the controversy is a good thing. I've found that sorting the comments in this thread by controversial actually provided the most discussion.

I'm with you on this one. This is an incredible change that will hopefully promote discussion on the website. There are other changes that I would love to see implemented, but this is already a fantastic start and something I never thought the admins would even consider.

Thanks for the controversy, and thanks for speaking your mind. People should not be downvoted for opinions. That's what made people view reddit as a hivemind/echo chamber in the first place. This site needs more people that truly don't give a damn about votes and are willing to post a comment that goes against what seems to be the popular view.

Yeas, a comment with 3000 up votes and 3000 down votes is shown 100% purely for cosmetic purposes, it's not like it's reflecting the obscene amount of people that are now connecting in this small way through internet, voicing their opinion...

How is this even a valid question? You're asking whether people vote on something... because of how it's already been voted on? People don't upvote or downvote anything because of the hivemind response, although that does seem the case in larger subs. However, again, in smaller subs, people upvote things they like and feel contribute to the pool of content in a good way.

Overall, I think you're only focusing on the submission side of this change. People generally don't hate that part as much; it's the comments that are affected so horribly, since comments are the main source of interactive feedback that provide more information than simply clicking an arrow next to the submission and moving on.

The more votes you had, the more the displayed value would drift from reality, but a really popular entry in one of our contests might only get 75 upvotes, so the displayed value was close enough.

I know the admins have said that this change doesn't remove information but people have come up with scenarios where it seems to have either removed information or made it less accessible.

As a case in point, it looks like you can no longer tell HOW negative the point total for a post is since it looks like their total can't go below 0 now.

As a moderator, I try to read each post using an RSS feeder rather than open each post in Reddit; it lets me see all the content that comes through my group and is faster. The rest of the time, I'd just watch the new item queue (using RES) to see if something took a sudden karma dive.

Now, if I see a post in the new listing with a zero score, I'll have to open it up, potentially every time I'm checking the list, to see if it's currently 1 up / 2 down, 101 up / 110 down, or 5 up / 200 down. I'd deal with each of those situations differently. Prior to this, I could make those decisions from the new item listing without opening the post again.

As for using the ""revised"" controversial sorting order, without knowing how it sorts, I can't rely on it to help me catch problems before they develop. Using my example above, which posts are more controversial - 1/2, 101/110, or 5/200? I'd say the 101/110 is the most controversial but it's the one I'm most likely to not remove, the other 2 are less controversial but more likely to require action from me.

That's compared to a default subreddit where the fuzziness could swing the vote count several hundred votes in either direction.

We would have weekly build contests, and requested that entries were done as link posts to an album of the build with a particular keyword in the title of the post. When the contest would end, we would run a search for that keyword, in our case ""[WBC]"" and then tally only the upvotes on each post. The highest upvote total won.

We knew this wasn't perfect but it encouraged submissions since people would get karma for the link posts, and it didn't require any additional effort from the users (such as remembering to come back to vote for their favorites).

So it sounds like going forward, we will need to setup a text post, enable contest mode and repost each entry as a top-level comment. The subscribers will then need to remember to upvote both the initial submission and the official voting comment for that submission.

Is that a correct assessment for how to use Contest Mode?

Also, the link to contest mode you included in your comment said

It's important to know whether a comment is controversial. Seeing an insightful comment with a negative score or an awful comment with a positive score is really demoralising. The upvote/downvote totals let readers know if a lot of people expressed a dissenting opinion, which makes an enormous psychological difference.

Under the new system, I think subreddits will seem like more like hostile hiveminds, and people will be discouraged from expressing their opinions if they think (possibly completely inaccurately) that they are vastly outnumbered and their comments will just be buried.  This is going to make Reddit a less pleasant place for everyone except those who feel the most secure in the mainstream acceptance of their opinions.

I'm also worried that abusive voting will become impossible to detect by moderators if the subtotals are hidden.

All of this has been said before, but I wanted to add my perspective as a sort-of-n00b.

Previously the percentage shown (eg ""66% like it"") was fake, and now it's accurate to a point.

(Edit: I'm talking about the *submission* votes here, not comment votes.  I don't support the changes to comment votes).

Given that we now know (upvotes - downvotes) and (% upvotes), we can actually get closer to accurately knowing the real upvote and downvote figures than we could before, using a bit of math.

Previously, there was no way to get anywhere near the true figures - the percentage was fake so that was no help, and the upvotes and downvotes were fuzzed so you didn't know how far off they were from true.  All we knew before was the (upvotes - downvotes) figure.

So I would totally disagree that they're now showing ""zero info"" - they're actually now showing more info than before.

I've noticed whenever I make a fairly controversial comment, the probability that it will be upvoted or downvoted is directly proportional to the first few votes. E.g., if my comment almost immediately gets a few upvotes it will generally do well, and if it gets -2 or less it will probably do poorly. This is why /u/REDDIT_HARD_MODE has the name - because people will automatically tend to disagree just because he has 0 votes or less. It's understandable because redditors have automatically condition themselves that ""negative comment = bad comment"" and will subconsciously read the comment with that prejudice. It's not a good thing, but it's definitely understandable. 

It's going to get worse too because of this update. If I see a comment at -10, my view of that comment is going to be skewed - unless I see that the comment has 90 upvotes and 100 downvotes, then my opinion on the comment will change greatly. If I just see the -10, I'll probably be more inclined to disagree with the comment just because I'd automatically assume that they have 10 downvotes and 0 upvotes.

 [**Kübler-Ross model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross%20model): [](#sfw) 

---

>

>The __Kübler-Ross model__, or the __five stages of grief__, is a series of emotional stages experienced when faced with impending death or death of someone. The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood\)) and acceptance.

>The model was first introduced by Swiss-American Psychiatrist [Elisabeth Kübler-Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_K%C3%BCbler-Ross) in her 1969 book, *On Death and Dying*, and was inspired by her work with [terminally ill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness) patients.  Motivated by the lack of curriculum in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross began a project which examined death and those faced with it while working as an instructor at the [University of Chicago's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago) medical school. Kübler-Ross' project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research became the foundation for her book, and revolutionized how the U.S. medical field takes care of the terminally ill. In the decades since the publication of ""On Death and Dying"", the Kübler-Ross concept has become largely accepted by the general public; however, its validity has yet to be consistently supported by the majority of research studies that have examined it. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

>Elisabeth Kübler-Ross noted that the stages are not meant to be a complete list of all possible emotions that could be felt, and they can occur in any order. Her hypothesis holds that not everyone who experiences a life-threatening or life-altering event feels all five of the responses, due to [reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) of personal losses differing between people.

that difference is small enough to be irrelevant.  

So, no, you didn't have an accurate idea. But you'd still know if a 100-point comment was uncontested at +104|-4 or controversial at +1536|-1436. And even at lower levels in a smaller sub, you'd know if your +1 comment was really (1|0) or (5|4), which are still very different.

Reddit has grown, dramatically.. the user base today is not remotely what it was 5-6-7-8 years ago.  The default subs are a joke.. in fact IIRC many are actually about jokes aren't they?  I haven't seen many of them in a very long time.  

The current user base enjoys them.  They are consuming this content and are happy with it.  It's hard to serve a small subset of a community when the vast majority want different things altogether.  

A new site will start.. the old guard here will move, as we did 8-ish years ago when reddit started.. it will repeat.

Digg v4, a massive redesign of the site that went live in August 2010, was a failure, hated by users and widely criticised. As Kevin Rose recalled this month - with some irony - in a video response to Reddit questioners, ""We were really trying to play catch-up... Digg v4 was trying to rethink Digg, trying to get more of the mainstream news readers."" 

Drew Curtis, creator of the enormously successful not-news site Fark.com, remembers it vividly. ""Digg scrapped the existing site, replaced it with a completely different site, then insisted that the new site was an improvement over the old,"" he told us. ""It wasn't a redesign, it was a total replacement. People are willing to put up with a lot of extreme site redesign, a la Facebook, but they're unwilling to be lied to."" It wasn't a deliberate lie, he stresses, but what Digg said it was doing and what its loyal users though it was doing were clearly very different.

The redesign wasn't the only problem. ""The concept was broken,"" Curtis says, recalling that it was explained to him like this: ""I would create a Fark account on Digg, upload my content to a Digg Fark page, people on Digg would read the content, and then miraculously we'd get traffic."" That clearly wouldn't work for Fark, which is all about the links, but it probably wouldn't work for other publishers either. ""Consider how the New York Times would view this: they were supposed to upload their articles onto Digg, people would then read them on Digg, and Step 3, traffic!""

Curtis wasn't impressed. ""It was pretty clear that one, the redesign was going to drive off Digg's community, and two, the content sites it was aimed at weren't going to use it either.""

And that's exactly how it panned out.""

Everybody else is still here doing fine doing the same things they've always done, only with less useless crying about downvotes. 

Plenty of people here have offered constructive feedback and suggestions for alternative solutions or adaptations to address what they see as some of the drawbacks to this change. Mods have chipped in to highlight some of the problems they feel it will cause them combating things like vote brigading and whatnot. Specialty subs that use upvotes for contests or whatever have plead their cases calmly. All of that is helpful feedback and input that might actually influence the admins as they consider adapting this in near future as they've said they will consider doing. It could mean partial rollbacks, adaptations, or new features to address some of these issues. And others have simply said, ""I don't like this,"" which isn't exactly helpful but at least isn't ridiculous or vicious.

Then there is the petulant poop-flinging riot by entitled young people who think ""fuck you"" and calling the admins a bunch of idiots is a good way to lobby for change.

Of course a horrendously stupid post will be self-evident. Having said that, there will be times where you want to know if a post is at all controversial or contested.  
For instance, lets say I've asked for advice pertaining to a particular issue I'm having with my computer. If I get a response that I think might be okay but it gets loads of downvotes and no upvotes I will completely disregard the suggestion. On the other hand, if I get a response that has mixed up and downvotes I would feel more inclined to look into their claims to see if it applies to my situation.

Additionally, my point was more about comments being downvoted to the point where they're hidden or posts that are downvoted enough to not make it out of /new. How am I going to know if it's wrong/bad/X semi-valid downvote reason or just being brigaded if it's not something that I'm at all informed about.

When one or more of the IP addresses he was using was banned, he knew immediately because its votes stopped being reflected in the vote count.  So he retired those bots from his army and gradually recruited more.

Then, reddit implemented vote fuzzing.

So he can't drop any bots out of his bot army, and he gets diminishing returns from his bots because he has to grow the army despite not getting any better voting power on Reddit.

* 1 up vote and 6 down votes will show as ""14% like this"" and have a score of ""-5"".

There are no two scenarios given which would show the same figures, and in all scenarios it's possible to see what the trends and numbers are.

In fact, it's possible to work backwards from the new figures.

* If something says ""80% like this"" and has a score of ""100"" then we can calculate around ((100 / 80-20) * 100) = 166 people voted of which (166 * 0.8) = 133 upvoted and (166 * 0.2) = 33 downvoted.

These figures will be reasonably accurate given the accuracy of the percentage that reddit provides.

8304,5hwy8,cibjcft,t1_cibi0k7,t3_28hjga,1403180099.0,2,"> This post stands at 63%. Now, 63% of what??! Is that 63% of 10,000, or 63% of 100? 

Previously, you had no way of knowing.  All you had was the final score (upvotes - downvotes).  The percentage was fake, and the upvotes and downvotes were fuzzed, and you didn't know how much because the percentage was fake.

Now, the percentage is supposedly accurate, so you can calculate it.

Right now, we're at 62% like it, and 1271 points.

X - Y = 1271, X = 0.62 * (X + Y), find X and Y

X + Y = 5296 (total votes)

X = 3284 (upvotes)

Y = 2012 (downvotes)

Let's check our math: 3284 - 2014 = 1272 (one off due to rounding), and 3284 = 62% of 5296.  Yay.

So, the new percentage now allows you to calculate the upvotes and downvotes to within whatever accuracy the percantage is reported at.  This is a big improvement on the old system where the percentage was fake so you had no way of knowing how much the votes were fuzzed - if it was 3284 up and 2014 down or if it was 11272 up and 10000 down, all you knew was the gap.

Extension writers can start writing extensions to estimate the upvotes and downvotes!

> These new metrics are dishonest and deceptive

Quite the opposite: having the percentage in the past, when it was 100% fabricated (it was just a number that tended towards about 55% as the submission got more votes overall regardless of actual votes), was deceptive and dishonest.  The new percentage is actually based on reality.  They have removed the fake numbers.

That loop never existed.  I understand that you and many others made an error in assuming the vote fuzz count was a real world indicator of votes.  This is why Reddit is removing it.  It was illusionary, it did nothing useful - and what it did was quite damaging, because it led people to vote based on it in rare situations, like the ones you described.

That's why it's gone.  It didn't do anything other than mislead people who didn't know it was fake.  

> Voting and actually seeing the vote count accurately change on refresh encourages a feeling of having an impact.

This just never happened.  And again, it's important to stress that a lot of people just didn't know any better about this.  Reddit attempted to educate its users but in the end, there's always going to be someone who just *did not understand or know in the first place* - so they removed the system altogether, an arguably better defense against bots and people who don't vote based on content, like they should.

Let me just explain why I'm perturbed by this. 

At the moment you have -48 points. You can get this score from an infinite amount of ways, but all that matters are the next two examples:

(0|-48) and (1000|-1048)

In the first, you are heavily downvoted and everyone completely disagrees with you. You have 100% of the community against you. In the second, you are extremely controversial. Sure, more of the community disagrees than agrees, but you only seem to have ~50% of the community against you. 

Without seeing the actual upvote and downvote numbers, how are we supposed to know if we are being blindly downvoted, or if the comment is going through controversial times? How are you, in this instance, supposed to know that there *are* 1000 people who agree with you. You're not alone!

All we see from this is -48, and is as ambiguous as the number infinity is itself. Do the admins realize this?

And I understand those (#|#) were strictly from RES, but come on, it was a feature *for a reason*. Obviously, many people care about those numbers, why remove them?

Yes well I expect the change has broken other apps that parse reddit as well, though I suspect that is part of why they feel they need to do it. IT is fairly trivial to mechanise voting, it is less easy to mechanise posting unique content. Still I think karma can work to that end in the sense that the most active members who both post and comment obviously have more resonance than those who just read and vote. In that sense the ratio between comment karma and link karma is a good indication, if my idea about proportional karma was used.

There were 100+ comments calling the OP sexists and insensitive because he pointed out that the streamer was female in the title. Obviously he didn't mean it that way and he wasn't trying to be offensive, he was just trying to state an obvious fact. It was a gamer, she was a girl, and she was robbed while streaming. But a bunch of people got up in arms over it and decided it was his turn to be taken down a peg.

I'm a moderator of /r/CanadaPolitics, which has a ""hide-downvote"" CSS.  In that subreddit, we try to encourage discussion between people of differing ideologies because that discussion is *downright interesting*.

Unfortunately, Reddit on the whole has a moderately left-leaning slant.  Comments expressing (typically, but not always) conservative views attract downvotes well out of proportion to their quality.  Worse yet, with default Reddit settings comments are *hidden* beyond a threshold (default -5 points, if I remember correctly), which then buries the opinion *and all replies*.  I've seen lots of really interesting discussions hidden behind ""comment score below threshold.""

We have relatively strict moderation to enforce comment quality (no insults, no low-content comments or memes/sloganeering).  Downvotes add nothing more than a popularity contest.

Yes, disabling downvotes via CSS doesn't solve the problem, but *each* downvote otherwise discouraged is a win for keeping comments visible.  We don't have to eliminate them entirely.",False,False,False,164641,8106,1330729019.0,False,True

Reddit tries as it can to make the system smarter to detect them automatically, but since everything is shared with the community, the spammers also have the advantage of knowing how everything works. They figure out how shadowbans happen or what the system uses to detect the foul play and work around them.

This new system obfuscate completely the votes and makes it really hard to figure out how many upvotes there are on a comment. It will piss off a lot of people since, like I said, each vote counts as a person's opinion, and now you can't know how much people voted on something. 

But it also puts a big wrench on the spammers, as they themselves can't know if the vote worked or if it even made a difference on the popularity of the comment. They may think an account is shadowbanned but they can't even be sure anymore, meaning more time wasted for them trying to figure out.

... Let's say you have a specific, niche product you want to advertise (portable handheld weed vaporizer, for instance). Your best move is to use an unremarkable account to start contributing normal, non-advertisement content on smaller (weed and vaporization) subreddits.

Once you're an established poster, you slowly start endorsing your product, simply by pretending to be a satisfied consumer. If you have the resources, this is where you'd begin to have sock puppet accounts echoing your approval and downvoting dissent (and unsatisfied customers).

The result is eventually you have companies (like MFLB) with an extremely strong, entrenched positive presence on specific boards (like r/trees) even though their product is cheap garbage that has a terrible reputation everywhere else.

>There's a big different between a comment with 2 upvotes and 1 downvote and one with 1000 upvotes and 998 downvotes. With this new system they would be judged exactly the same while one is a lot more controversial and able to spark conversation than the other.

... wouldn't the comment itself spark the conversation? If a reddit user was looking for controversial posts than there is a controversy ranking that the user could implement.

It comes down to this.  It depends on what you think the up and down votes are suppose to represent in comments.... people will down vote for a number of reasons. It doesn't agree with their views, it's offensive, it doesn't add to the conversation. You think it's exclusively to represent if you agree or disagree with the opinion. I think it's for adding or subtracting from the conversation. It's obviously a mixture of both. But the general gist I would suspect, is that 1000 people think you should see and 998 people think you shouldn't. What rules out? In this case, it's the majority (at least in the best category) and I think that's fair. 

But ultimately.... who cares how many people agree or disagree with you. I don't give a crap, I only care for written responses, that's more interesting to me...  people have lived without RES before and they can live without it again. 

>Not to mention the fact that this change completely breaks any sub that uses contest mode (which is a lot)

I've never personally seen these contest modes. But I'm completely sure that they will survive... I'm assuming they only look at upvotes. Maybe their reliance on that system is a bit flawed. Seeing as you could cheese it. 

>It's true that most users don't use RES. That's also a moot point though since users that use RES tend to be a lot more active and care about the quality of the website, their comments, and submissions.

Look at it this way.  The average reddit user won't even notice the difference.  They didn't see the comment ratios before and still don't now.  They don't care about this change because it doesn't affect them in any way.  The entire reason I got RES was to show the upvote to downvote ratio.

It was the last part of the comment that I sure led to you're being downvoted by a bunch of other people as well: ""I don't see the big deal really lol but nothing changes for me."" It sounds like your general attitude in life is that nothing can be important if it doesn't affect you personally. This does actually affect you, by the way, you just never paid any attention to it either way so it's easy to not see how it does. It came off like ""oh well, I don't understand what is going on, and I don't want to know even if you just tried to explain it to me, so how can this be important?""

I don't know how to explain it. It just feels obnoxious as hell, like the way a 12 year old would think about the world. I'm being obnoxious now too, so there's not much more to talk about anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you don't understand something and don't even want to accept help in understanding it, don't even comment on whether the issue is a big deal or not. You can't possibly know if you don't understand it. 

This is just another example of what reddit does to people and the vote counts are probably a huge part of what grows this kind of bullshit. I hope everyone starts chilling out and being nicer over time without this, including myself. Even if this ends up being a good thing and I don't bite at people over reddit anymore, seeing people choose not to not understand very easy concepts is always going to irritate me. If this happened a month from now you probably wouldn't have heard a peep from me, but you still would have been ignorant. ",False,False,1403262667.0,83813,3053,1363137969.0,False,False

What you see here is a divide. 

You consider Reddit as a monolithic site, a single entity with different parts working together. The community that makes it sees it as two things, the defaults and biggest concentrations of people being one thing, and the small communities being a different place altogether, with different rules, audience, conversations and the like.

By treating all the site as one thing and applying rules that may work well on the huge defaults of millions of subscribers but will only harm the small ones with barely hundreds, you're harming what's probably the best part of the site, the communities that still feel like a community and not a faceless crowd, specially for the veterans among us that have been on the site for a long time

So the dagger tells us that something is controversial. That is still only *slightly* less vague than no info at all. Is it 10,000 upvotes and 9,999 down, or 20 up and 19 down? At what point does ""significantly"" kick in?

When you changed the interface to get rid of the ranks on the side, people didn't like that, either. But you had a good explanation for it - there's limited space on the page, and you wanted to make more efficient use of that space.

But people didn't like it, so you changed it back.

I saw [cupcake1713's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/28kfbq/meta_can_we_have_a_community_discussion_about/cic28ev).

Yes, it's a reason.

Yes, not everyone here reads or posts in /r/sysadmin or similar techie-orietned subs. But don't insult the intelligence of the people here who do - they are a significant part of your userbase.

Second: I appreciate your efforts but this doesn't change much.  A comment with 1† could be (101|100) or (551|550). That dagger is not enough information as I see it. 

What about a combination with the info showed for submissions and the one showed for comments? Both having % of upvotes and a controversial indicator?

Where:

* _n_: Number of votes.  Proxy for ""interest"".  Perhaps int(log(10)) or int(ln)of the value.
* _m_: Mean of votes.  Proxy for ""quality"".
* _s_: Standard deviation of votes.  Proxy for controversiality.

Taking the log of n would be of some use in distinguishing posts with low engagement, limiting the detail (integer or one decimal resolution) would limit the ability of bots to determine how effective they're being in moderations.

As for the issues with smaller subs getting hit by downvote brigades / trolls, giving more visibility on subscribers to mods, limiting voting to subscribers, and/or setting minimum age to moderate, would be useful.

I'd also like for mods to have the ability to override vote-based hiding of comments.

Generally, I think limiting moderation influence, making it an ""earned"" capability (maybe a ""moderator"" badge), and/or discarding low-valued mod actions when more credible mods are available, could be useful.  I know it's a complex space.

Once upon a time there was a pretty good site called Livejournal. When they started they were for the users, by the users. They grew a loyal fanbase that was willing to pay for perks and that used the site extensively. 

Then the site was sold and gradually over time it started to rely more and more on ads. So they made changes to the site. And they didn't listen. Because when the advertisers pay you then when they say jump you say how high, right? So you make a little change, and there's only a fraction of users who complain and maybe leave. Then you make another little change, and another fraction of users complain and maybe leave. And so it goes. 

The problem? When you add up 1%, and then 3%, and then 6%, and then 3%, and so on? Eventually your user base starts to erode, especially if another site comes along and offers a better platform. And without the userbase? Your advertisers will leave for greener pastures. 

I don't think that Reddit is plunging down the tubes or anything - I've been using the site for less than a year, so I'd be foolish to say so. But try as I might, I *cannot* think of any other motivation for this change except that you're trying to please advertisers. That makes me sad. 

So because I like the site, I'm going to say this: please listen to your users. I'll admit that this shows effort, at least, but I worry that as time goes on you'll be less and less inclined to be flexible.

>A better idea would be to, you know, maybe admit that it wasn't a good idea and go back to the way it was.

I think there needs to be a scale, so you know *how* controversial a comment is.

I have an idea on how this could work

-----------------------------------

**Calculation of Rating**

    // Gives it a controversial rating of about 0-5
    // Z would be a multiplier so it works better in smaller subreddits
    // You could base Z off of the votes on the submission the comment
    // is on. I haven't made a formula for that yet, will update

    // Makes the variable between 0 and 1, and sets the up:down
    // ratio to be the same for mirrored up/down votes
    If UP/DWN > 1
        V = 1/(UP/DWN)
    else
        V = (UP/DWN)
    endif


    //Formula
    If V > 0.2 then
        ConRate = (((UP+DWN)^(0.2))*√(V))*Z
    else
        ConRate = 0
    endif

    If ConRate > 1
         display ConRate
    endif

---------------

**Examples of ratings with different votes**

Here are some examples of what you would get:

5000 upvotes, 4000 downvotes  
5.53, an extremely high rating, although this vote count is almost mythical

Let's say you have 200 upvotes and 204 downvotes  
3.28, fairly high

5000 upvotes 500 downvotes  
This is detected as not controversial and has no rating

17 up, 23 down  
1.79, could be higher depending on the multiplier

3 up, 2 down  
1.12, a very low rating as this post has no attention

400 up, 150 down  
2.2, while this post has a lot of total votes, most people upvoted it

3 up, 14 down  
0.82, this would not be considered controversial unless if there is a multiple. Even if there is it would be fairly low as most people downvoted it

------------------------

**How this number could be used or represented**

Now how would you show this number? I have to proposals on how you could do this. You could just show the number to the nearest tenth, but that could be giving up too much information, in which case you could manipulate the number to put it on a 1-10\* scale. (Multiply by 2, subtract 1, round to nearest whole number)


#\*It would be possible to go over 10, but only on a mythically controversial comment

Or maybe the interval must be contained completely within an interval centered at 50%, say [40%, 60%].

For comments with lots of votes, this doesn't make them more likely to be labeled controversial, unless they actually are truly controversial. If they aren't, the confidence interval will move away from 50%. For small subreddits, comments with sufficient votes will also still get the controversial indicator. If they don't have sufficient votes, then there simply isn't enough information to reliably determine if they are controversial or not. This isn't the Reddit admin's fault, it just statistics.

While all of the drama surrounding this latest ""crisis"" may seem like it's an indication of the beginning of the end (and while it still may very well indicate changes coming to the integral features of reddit - such as the removal of downvote button...) I think that overall, no one would want to see reddit replaced with something new - or worse - all together disappear.

At this point there are enough users on reddit that I feel there's almost no change/miscalculation that can be made by either the admin or the users that could be seen as directly responsible to the site's eventual downfall...

>A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes.

Reddit's search, for example, is often criticized for being horrendous. The ability to tag posts is one of the longest feature requests in the book (and likely a necessity for getting the search to work well, since many posts don't have descriptive titles).

Reddit's mobile site is sorely lacking. It can't even display everything properly without being cut off.

There's several features that I consider very important to reddit that are only in RES (such as the live preview). Presumably the majority of redditors are deprived from these features because of this (RES is well known, but I still see posts on a daily basis asking what RES is).

The ability to flag posts as either NSFW or NSFL has also been an outstanding feature request for ages. It's a topic that still comes up regularly. Likewise for the ability to edit titles.

Proper spoiler tags are also a long time request (the current ones are subreddit CSS. If the subreddit mods suck, you don't get spoiler tags. Also, they don't show up on the mobile site or if you disable subreddit CSS).

User configurable CSS and JS is another, although it's not important since Stylish or GreaseMonkey can allow this functionality on any site (although not linked to account).

>A __dagger__, or __obelisk__, U+2020 † dagger (HTML: &#8224; &dagger;), is a typographical symbol or [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph). The term ""obelisk"" derives from Greek ὀβελίσκος (*obeliskos*), which means ""little obelus""; from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek): ὀβελός (*[obelos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelus)*) meaning ""roasting spit"".  It was originally represented by the [÷](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%B7) symbol and was first used by the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) scholars as critical marks in manuscripts.

>A __double dagger__ or __diesis__, U+2021 ‡ double dagger (HTML: &#8225; &Dagger;), is a variant with two handles.

As someone that actually has access to the data to be able to see exactly how effective it is, I think you'd be surprised. In fact, it's extremely effective against a lot of different methods that people use to try to manipulate voting on the site.

It sounds like you're assuming that massive, organized bot operations are the only sort of thing we need to worry about, but that's really not the case. Those sorts of things definitely do show up sometimes, but the large majority of the vote-manipulation that's going on all the time is far more ""casual"", and the vote-fuzzing does a very good job at making it difficult for people to tell how much of an effect they're having.

As a simple example, one of the most common types of vote-cheating on the site is just people that create multiple accounts and use them to upvote everything they post on their main account. This is really easy for us to detect and block, but the vote-fuzzing makes it so that it's not obvious to the person that they're not actually affecting anything at all.

But you've found me out you sleuth and have ruined everything. God damn it. Thanks a lot. Now it was all for nothing, all this endless chatting. I've made a huge mistake.

I'm here for conversation. I don't care about the votes. I never have. I forget to vote most of the time because it's not why I'm here. And the people that nauseate me on this site more than any other, an answer I should have given in that recent ""what makes you go from zero to rage instantly"" askreddit question, and one of the few types I remember to vote on because they suck so much, are the downvote whiners in every thread and the ones who base their whole participation on these stupid points. They delete their comments if they start to get downvotes because oh no my points! Or if they get downvotes they go back and edit and try to backpedal for forgiveness as the anonymous downvoting crowd pounds their opinion back into line. Many even apologize even though they didn't say anything offensive, but just stated an opinion! It's disgusting. What a bunch of noodle-spined cowards. 

I say what I think and am sometimes surprised when I come back to the conversation later and see that it's gotten a bunch of upvotes. I was just talking. Same with downvotes. Other times I know why I got votes because it was predictable, I knew they were coming, and I don't care and don't edit the post and don't delete it because I meant what I said regardless of what 5 or 50 or 500 invisible people, robots, or deskwalking cats think about it. A ""herd of anonymous randos with unknown rationales"" is exactly what redditors are, and that includes you and me unless we take the time to comment and discuss. Then we get some background, some context, some rationale, and that's meaningful or at least useful. 

You and I disagree for example and you have contempt for me. If you got a bunch of downvotes, which you seem to value so much, every one of them could be from someone like me. Or worse, they could be from the 16 or 20 year old knowitall version of me who has things figured out already and could run the world (and reddit) if just put in charge. If you knew that about us, and you knew our various random reasons for downvoting such as your spelling, your username, a stale RES tag, opposite political party, don't care for your tone, we sneezed while we voted, you simply disagreed with something we said earlier, we're trying to make our comment go higher than yours irrespective of whatever yours is, didn't like something else that you said, vendetta, we're a robot, whatever, you could and would easily and totally disregard our votes and feel fine about your comment or post. But when we're nothing but one or twelve or 200 identical anonymous periwinkles, you for some reason imbue us all with equal value.

I don't know if you're one of the chronic downvote whiners or the habitual deleting cowards or backpedaling comment editors, but those people are responding to people of unknown backgrounds in unknown places with unknown expertise and unknown experience and unknown rationales for voting. Since you and I have spoken and you have developed your contemptuous opinion of me, you can safely disregard me. But if I and 30 of my clones around the world had downvoted you somewhere and said nothing, I bet based on your attitude here that you'd be puzzled, hurt, unsure of yourself, irritated, bitter, reactionary, and would be here making some sardonic or nasty write-off edit about how we're a bunch of idiots who can't see sense. And you'd decide on some reasons you guessed at for why we must be downvoting and level those charges. But you'd never know. We could instead be 30 Nobel laureates who determined that your information was balls, or 30 reddiquette sticklers who felt it didn't add to the conversation, or 30 people having a bad day. Or a mix of lots of kinds for lots of unknown reasons. No idea.

I'm not here to ""put things out for review"" as you've said. It's not a polling or validation site for me. If I ask a question because I don't know something, clearly I want input. If I make a statement, it's what I think. I'm otherwise here for info, links out, and conversations. If someone wants to engage me in conversation, that's great. And I'll be able to tell from that whether I value their opinion or input. Yours, for example, is easy for me to dismiss now that we've interacted, just as you dismiss mine. As an anonymous downvote, I'd have dismissed you as irrelevant but at least this way you had a chance. I don't know what I expected posting in this thread but I'll leave you guys to your jerk.

It is clear though that that's not *all* vote fuzzing was for - that doesn't explain the absurd numbers of additional votes on every popular post, for instance. Actually, now that I think about it, I don't even understand how vote fuzzing could have ever worked to prevent spam accounts from being able to tell - raw scores were still accurate, right? So posting in a private sub and upvoting once from the potentially compromised account should always have been to tell.

is there any chance of this happening? even better, instead of making the fuzzed upvotes/downvotes dependent on a 3rd party extension, why not add them to reddit itself. it can even be disabled by default with a little not explaining fuzzing when someone goes to turn it on to prevent the posts that the change was claimed to be combating.

taking away upvote/downvote counters objectively made reddit a worse site than it was previously, and the little controversial icon is the equivalent of taking a 5oz dixie cup of water into the desert (aka nice, but nowhere near sufficient)

in the OP, you claimed to be implementing that feature as a sign of ""listening to the community"". please put your money where your mouth is and actually do so. the community doesn't want this information removed.

One ""solution"" would be to remove the percentage entirely.

It's very rough, but then again, so is the net votes that is currently being displayed (in fact, I would argue that the net votes is less useful than the fuzzed distribution). Reddit could perhaps also do more to educate users regarding how the site works. This would include things such as including more details about voting works and reddiquette.

What? No. They did vote fuzzing to discourage people from spamming, by making it look like their posts were getting more attention than they really were.

If it's being downvoted then it will register as controversial. Otherwise it's comment score will remain steady. More importantly, replies to said comment will indicate if the advice is reliable or not. Also, you seem reasonably intelligent so I would imagine you can tell a good comment from a bad one by actually reading it. 

> r/teslamotors is a similarly small sub. People looking to stir up trouble post contrary news articles. Is there validity to their post that simply hasn't been read yet or are they getting karma rep'ed by other trolls?

Not entirely accurate. I said that *hiding the real vote counts* is essential to prevent spam. Fuzzing was one way of doing that.

For an explanation of why this is the case, take a look at these comments:

[/u/kenjisan231 explains how Reddit's 'vote fuzzing' works and why they do it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1s7vxh/why_did_the_post_about_nelson_mandelas_passing_go/cdvip79?context=1)

[/u/super6plx thoroughly explains reddit vote fuzzing and its effects on vote bots, for those wondering](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/1vehg6/gopro_on_the_back_of_an_eagle/cersffj)


If you disagree about hiding the vote counts being important, well... good for you. But how would you know? Do you have any experience in this area? Are you a software developer that has worked on combating spam on a massively popular website where creating accounts is incredibly simple to do automatically?

It's not that I doubt there might be an alternative. But preventing spam is a **big deal**. It's **really difficult**. It a cat-and-mouse game; the minute some security researcher has a neat idea to prevent spam, somebody else comes up with a clever way of circumventing it. There is no easy solution to this problem.

I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about when you mention people upvoting spambots... what I'm talking about is people automating the process of creating accounts and adding upvotes. I'm talking about a company that wants to upvote all positive comments for their product, or a bored programmer with a fragile ego trying to inflate their karma artificially.

Vote fuzzing in comments and for low-volume of submissions are to make it impossible for you to tell if *your* exact vote counts or not.

By not knowing the counts (especially if it's controversial, because all you see is 2 upvotes, not 50 up/ 48 down, for eg.), you're more inclined to make a decision for yourself rather than ask, ""why are people downvoting this?"" You're also less likely to reply *because* of the votes (karmawhoring) and more-so because you actually have something to add. For eg., if someone karmawhoring finds a 100 up / 96 down post that was posted 30 minutes ago, you can be sure they'll reply for the sake of getting karma, not if they actually have something to add. 

Outside of controversial posts and smaller subreddit vote tallying, I can't see why it matters unless you're trying to gamify Reddit. karmawhore, or ego-stroke.

Certainly! But the comment score still does this pretty well I think.

Herein lies the problem; we can never know whether a comment really got a (22|21) rating, because we can never know which comments were fuzzed. Maybe it really only had a (10|9) rating for example, and it was padded with 12 extra votes on either side because ~~an account flagged for spam voted on it 12 times~~ 12 accounts flagged for spam voted on it.

Is there not a way to have votes just be votes? No fuzzing? Am I oversimplifying the voting process? I would think there would be a way to write code to work around that.

Two thoughts come to mind with this ""fuzzing votes"" hullabaloo: 
One, if it is a code thing, write new code to disallow it.
Two, If it is a human thing (i.e., asshole people down voting just to down vote) wouldn't they down vote regardless of what symbol appears?

I'll finish by saying I have absolutely zero clue about writing code, and I'm certain that I don't understand how votes were being fuzzed. So, if anyone could help to clarify this, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

The anti-spam measures add about 10% downvotes to comments that are more popular. 

As it approaches 1000 upvotes, they start adding more downvotes.

But the thing is, they don't add upvotes unless there are proven spam methods such as downvoting the user page.

They add downvotes to keep comments' overall scores at about 2000-3500 when comments become really popular.

Even if you assume that this simplistic definition is accurate, that provides a tiny fraction of the utility of seeing actual votes.

It'd be more like 145|20, if that. The total votes were always the same, and the amount of added downvotes was based on an algorithm and was only in relation to the number of upvotes -- thus, no comment with 100 legit upvotes would ever have more than like ~10 fake downvotes. Edit: And with comments especially, the vote fuzzing was either barely significant or completely meaningless. I've had comments that got 80 upvotes without any downvotes at all -- according to you, I should've gotten at least a few due to the fuzzing, but I didn't. Because reddit's algorithm simply doesn't work as loosely as you think.

Late edit to clarify (in case people happen to see this): When I said 

>no comment with 100 legit upvotes would ever have more than like ~10 fake downvotes.

I didn't phrase that correctly. What I meant to say was that if a comment has like 120 upvotes *total*, there won't be more than like 10 fake *downvotes* on it. Thus, the overall score of +110 is gonna be pretty darn accurate. The numbers don't start getting *really* fuzzed until we're talking about a front-page AMA or some shit -- where the votes will seemingly be like 2000|-1000 or some shit. In like Warwick Davis's AMA, the votes were something similar to that, though in reality, he probably got less upvotes *and* much less downvotes than what they ""show"" you. Something like a popular AMA with 2000|-1000 is probably actually more like 2500|-500, or *better*. Those are really the only times where the vote-fuzzing has an actual effect. Comments are less likely to be fuzzed in the first place until/unless they get like *hundreds* of votes. 

tl:dr -- if your comment has less than 200-300 total votes, I'd be willing to bet decent money that every single one of those votes came from legit users, not from vote-fuzzing. And IMO (though this is mostly just speculation based on my own comments), I don't think I've seen hardly *any* comments where it was apparent that vote-fuzzing was happening at all. Like I said, I still have a comment (in like seddit or something) that's got like 80 upvotes and 0 downvotes. So obviously the vote-fuzzing didn't take effect in that case. I think it's used once a post hits a certain threshold -- it might be used for comments too, but in this case we're talking about comments that have been upvoted to like 4 figures (similar to a popular post's votes, basically).

Sometimes this works. But it doesn't work well for controversial statements *especially* on smaller subs. Even in larger subs, (10|9) is the exact same as (100|99) even though the second one obviously had a lot more visibility. Not only that, there are a lot of cases where comments will get a handful of votes but no responses. 

For example, now a comment with (2|0) is the same as (6|4). If both have no replies there is absolutely no way to distinguish them. And in the case of (6|4) it is nice to know that ~9 people have read/interacted with my comment as opposed to 1 person.

>The aggregates were fuzzed no matter how few votes it received, so it was an unreliable way of determining controversy.

I don't think this is true (edit: for comments). Vote fuzzing didn't kick in until a certain threshold. Though if you have some sources stating otherwise I'd be happy to read them.

> Besides, I think it can improve discussion by forcing users to discern whether or not a comment is worthwhile based on the content, rather than what other people vote on.

That could be true to, but it is sort of a pick your poison situation. I don't think any system would be perfect, but it is pretty clear that many users would prefer the old system, fuzzed votes or otherwise.

Those votes only come from people that indicate they're reading your profile, and they don't impact actual sorting on the site.

---


Here's the argument:

Votes that are fuzzed don't count. Fuzzed votes don't change anything. The only information fuzzed votes used to give was that someone, or a bot, had participated on a specific piece of content.

What did that mean? Practically nothing. Now I just read the last 50 comments you made by accessing your comment history. You have no way of telling this because I don't vote or vote-cheat. I don't figure in the fuzzed votes count. The majority of ""stalkers"" don't indicate that they've been on your profile follow you around or whatever.

Fuzzed votes only showed a fraction of people accessing your comments or other ""stalking."" It didn't show people who legitimately voted on content by viewing your content in its original context having arrived there from your userpage.

So, this curiosa didn't mean anything. You knew that one or two people or bots were following you around, but you had no idea about the potential 10 others who didn't indicate to you that they were.

Further, there was nothing to worry about because their voting behavior wasn't impacting sorting at all.

---

So, as a mod, why is it important for you to see fuzzing? Answer: it's not. Your behavior is the typical user-case the admins want to stop because you were wasting your time on identifying ""stalkers"" that the system had already taken care of. I'm sure you can confer with your co-mods in /r/worldnews who were involved in the situation that took place before /r/technology was undefaulted. They will tell you that when voting behavior and brigades affect score, when things aren't fuzzed, that people are banned. That happens when groups of people downvote-stalk in ways to avoid vote fuzzing. In the scenario of fuzzed votes, the admins don't need to do anything because the situation is automatically resolved.

Awareness = knowledge and knowledge = power. Easily just one example are those rhinos that have a very small number left due to freakin' poaching. Personally I can't think of any animal I'd be happy to see gone FOREVER from this Earth. That just hurts my heart. I hope you can understand this and I'm not trying to be dickish anymore at all.

No, I didn't, because it was an edit after the post. But it doesn't matter.

Nothing changes. I don't *need* to know if my upvotes are effective. It's a brute force operation. I'll check once in awhile to see if I'm banned, other than that I don't care. If I wanted to be more subtle about it, I'd use something like Amazon Mechanical Turk to get upvotes.

It's not public, but Reddit has, I'm sure, *many* anti-spam measures in place. Weighting new accounts with no history less than an established account, stuff like that. 

The ""fuzzing"" of vote counts has been and still is completely ineffective. If you want to spam reddit, you're going to do it. You and I both know that. The removal (or even neutering in the case of fuzzing) of a useful feature is completely pointless. 

Again, as ""you don't seem to have read it"":

 * Even with fuzzing in place, there are ways around knowing ""if your vote counted or not"". It doesn't matter.
 * Nobody writing spam tools for reddit is going to check if every vote they made counted. Period.
 * If I'm writing spam tools for reddit, I don't care about fuzzing. I just don't. I'm going to do it either way. **It takes no more API requests or ""VPS"" power to determine if my votes count** than it does to check if I'm shadowbanned. And it doesn't matter anyway. 

If I'm trying to spam reddit, **I am not checking if I'm shadowbanned or if my votes have any effect** after every vote. Period. That would be completely pointless. Inbetween my first and second check to see if my votes are effective, the community will have already decided if my post is worthwhile.

Frankly, there is no blatant spam on reddit, at least as the general public users of the site would see it. As a normal user, I've literally never seen a single spam post (except maybe /r/HailCorporate type stuff) ever. It doesn't exist.

Maybe not. But my concern is with the ones who do. Yes, it's the internet, anyone can look and see what I've written. My concern is with the people who take the next step and act.

It's not uncommon for someone from an anti-women or anti-feminist sub to get angry about a user commenting on one of the various women's or feminist subs. And to go to their profile. And to downvote everything on the profile and then follow them to other, related subs and start derailing there. 

As a mod, I don't have time to go check the profile out of everyone who comes to my sub and breaks a low level rule. But if I notice there has been a lot of fuzzed voting recently, I'll check out the most recent new commenters. If one participants comments are fuzzed in particular, we'll make sure to pay attention to their activity, and be proactive about trolls. 

And we ask users who notice that someone came after all of their recent comments, or who got a nasty PM, and think that it was prompted by a recent contribution to our sub to let us know, so that we can check things out. Some stalkers get annoyed by something someone said and look for a recent person post or comment so they can reply nastily and when they get a response back, or a ban, that's when they up things by sending PMs. If we've noticed that the person's comments have been vote fuzzed, and we are therefore watching their stuff, we can often catch the comment and delete it and ban the person before anyone replies. They may send us angry modmail, but we often save people from a harassing PM. 

Proactive moderation is not easy, and it's incredibly timestaking. Vote fuzzing was one of a few tools that was great for giving us a heads up as to when something was going to happen. It allowed us to coordinate, ask mods to subscribe particular threads, or watch for certain behaviour. Sure, fuzzing isn't always a predictor. Sometimes there's fuzzing, but no drama. Sometimes there is drama, but no fuzzing. But I'd say that at *least* 80% of brigades and stalker situations had fuzzing beforehand. 

>In the scenario of fuzzed votes, the admins don't need to do anything because the situation is automatically resolved.

Dude, this is not about karma. I could not give a flying fuck about my karma or anyone else's. They are magic internet points good for a few cents via bitcoin. That's it. I do care about the subs I moderate and making sure that mods can stay on top of stuff. Prevent problems before they get bad, hopefully prevent some of our users from getting creepy PMs. Keep our users feeling safe. 

I'm not an idiot. I get how the internet works, I know people can read my profiles and stay invisible. I don't care about karma.

When xrumer is fed a banned account, it sees that it has a banned account and strips it. If skypespl gets ip banned it moves to a new proxy. No wasted time, no wasted anything.

Looking at the ratio of ups to downs was a way better indicator of controversiality than what we have now. The dagger basically says ""the post got upvotes and downvotes"". Wow, super helpful!

With the fuzzed ups and downs, you could get a rough idea of just *how* controversial a post was. Generally speaking, it's a 10:1 vote ratio for a universally liked comment. That's a pattern that me and many others have noticed. You could then extrapolate how controversial a comment was based on the ratio. 2:1 is more controversial, 3:2 is even more, and 1:1 is obviously split down the middle. It doesn't matter how many fuzzed votes are added, all that matters is the ratio (once you get into huge vote counts -- I still maintain that <50 vote counts are largely accurate with maybe 5-10 fuzzed votes on either side).

I have no problems with the new %liked feature because it is actually accurate. Hell, I mentally created a %liked number in my head using the up/down ratio. I'm miffed because there is no %liked for *comments*. Instead, we get a dagger that could mean anything from 30-70% liked. Wouldn't you rather have a concrete number? This is what most people are after. The total votes in RES is obviously meaningless for popular posts, but the ratio patterns that we've all started recognizing over the years is *not* meaningless.

But generally speaking, I liked having the numbers there, because a higher number (even if fuzzed), always meant that the post got a lot of attention. The bigger the number, the more attention, which means the post is likely more worth reading.

Mathematically speaking, you had no way of knowing with a decent degree of certainty whether a vote was fuzzed or legitimate. That's it.

I encounter my fair share of ideologues moderating /r/politics. I encounter my fair share of people telling other users to kill themselves, spewing hate speech and so on. We have low-volume submissions on gun-related political topics that always bring out harassment and abuse pretty consistently. If you express certain view-points on that, or other specific political topics, the hate comes pretty quick. We do a lot to preventatively deal with things before a situation occurs, and to ensure timeliness, automoderator is essential. Automoderator notifying mods when a thread should probably get extra attention is also essential. 

How thoroughly is your automoderator set up to automatically filter or report posts with phrases that are used entirely or overwhelmingly as insults? Whenever something happens in your subreddit or related to your subreddit, do you update your insults automod configurations to stamp out the newest batch of them?

Do you leave distinguished comments telling people when they've crossed the line so they get feedback that they've crossed a line and will be banned if they continue? If not, how do you intend on showing an active moderator presence and that discriminatory or hateful comments aren't acceptable?

This has nothing to do with karma. If you're moderating by the vote count numbers, I think you are spending time inefficiently. There are better moderation tools available to you that will catch much more of the bad activity at an earlier stage and have a greater preventative impact.

Information limiting is effective. Vote fuzzing is not. It's meaningless. If vote fuzzing is in effect, spammers can pretend the vote count API doesn't exist and be just as effective.

no, vote fuzzing prevents the spambot *knowing* that it's wasting time. This means it will continue to waste time.

>The __Mazda Tribute__ (*Code J14*) was a [compact SUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_SUV) made by [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) [automaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaker) [Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda) from 2000 to 2011. It was jointly developed with [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and based on the [front-wheel drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-wheel_drive) [Mazda 626](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_626) platform, which was in turn the basis for the similar [Ford Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escape) on the [CD2 platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_CD2_platform). The Tribute was priced below the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner in Ford's CD2 SUV lineup.

>The Tribute and Escape debuted in 2000, offering front or [all wheel drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_wheel_drive) and a choice of a [transversely mounted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversely_mounted_engine) 2.0 L Ford Zetec [4-cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_engines) engine or 3.0 L [Ford Duratec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Duratec) [V6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V6). Ford Escape was also sold as the Ford Maverick in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) with a Ford 2.0 L [I4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-4) Zetec engine with [manual transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission), or 3.0 L Duratec coupled to [automatic transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission).

>One main difference between the Tribute and the Ford Escape/Maverick is that the Tribute's suspension is tuned for a firmer ride than the Escape/Maverick, in order to correspond with Mazda's sporty image. As Mazda had offered ""spiced up"" models in other segments such as the Mazda 3 and CX-7, the utilitarian Tribute was replaced by the more aggressively styled [Mazda CX-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_CX-5) in North America.

Suffice it to say that if vote counts weren't fuzzed, shit like this would be happening a lot more, because bot makers would be able to fine-tune their bots to make sure they get past the spam filter.

13843,3qkyc,cih90qp,t1_cih7y3r,t3_293oqs,1403749449.0,2,"The idea is to make it impossible to tell if the bot's vote effects the overall score or not.

With proper vote totals shown, when they detect a bot the only thing they can do to stop it manipulating is stop it from voting. This makes it very easy to see that the bot is having no effect, so you look for new ways to bot to figure out how to get around their detection.

Without proper vote totals, either because of not showing them or using fake votes to counter the botted votes you have a much harder time figuring out if your bots are having an effect. When they showed fuzzed totals, the fuzzed votes wouldnt effect the overall score or the ranking on the page, but would show in the count. Even if you realize eventually that your bot is having no effect, you dont know exactly when it happened, so it's hard to tell what gave it away. If you show accurate totals and prevent bots from voting, the bot makers know exactly when you detected the bot which makes it much easier to figure out how to evade detection in future.

It's the same reason companies like blizzard and valve do mass bans of bots and cheaters every few weeks instead of banning as they catch them, it makes it harder for the people who write the bot/cheat programs to know how they were detected. In reddits case though, allowing vote bots to work for even a day without banning them could be harmful to the integrity of the site, so they go for hiding their effect, same as when they shadowban spammers.",False,False,False,7332,722,1259034682.0,False,False

>The __Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures__ was a series of [social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology) [experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology) conducted by [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) [psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) [Stanley Milgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Milgram). They measured the willingness of study participants to [obey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience_(human_behavior\)) an [authority figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority) who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience). Milgram first described his research in 1963 in an article published in the *[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Abnormal_and_Social_Psychology)*  and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, *[Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience_to_Authority:_An_Experimental_View).*

>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/8jyR5sY.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Milgram_Experiment_v2.png) - *The experimenter \(E\) orders the teacher \(T\), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner \(L\), who is actually an actor and confederate. The subject believes that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. Being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level. [1]*
