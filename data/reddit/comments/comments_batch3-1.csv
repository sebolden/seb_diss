* An actual explanation (even at a high level) of what is being done should be provided, not trying to laugh it off as a joke.
* Above all, you should calibrate user expectations as to what to expect to be better or different after the downtime.

* A 1 hour and 10 minute advance notice is unacceptable.  All planned downtimes should be at least 24 hours notice.  (And please don't try to spin this as emergency downtime.)
* An actual explanation (even at a high level) of what is being done should be provided, not trying to laugh it off as a joke.
* Above all, you should calibrate user expectations as to what to expect to be better or different after the downtime.

I hope my expertise in these matters will help improve the service level of reddit for everyone.

1154,4lx42,c1nat9c,t3_gg3qv,t3_gg3qv,1301633154.0,155,"Slime molds are organisms in two taxonomic groups, the cellular slime molds (Phylum Acrasiomycota) and the plasmodial slime molds (Phylum Myxomycota). Organisms in both groups are eukaryotic (meaning that their cells have nuclei) and are fungus-like in appearance during part of their life cycle. For this reason, they were traditionally included in mycology textbooks. However, modern biologists consider both groups to be only distantly related to the fungi . The two groups of slime molds are considered separately below.

Species in the cellular slime mold group are microscopic during most stages of their life cycle, when they exist as haploid (having one copy of each chromosome in the nucleus ), single-celled amoebas. The amoebas typically feed on bacteria by engulfing them, in a process known as phagocytosis , and they reproduce by mitosis and fission. Sexual reproduction occurs but is uncommon. Most of what we know about this group is from study of the species Dictyostelium discoideum. When there is a shortage of food, the individual haploid amoebas of a cellular slime mold aggregate into a mass of cells called a pseudoplasmodium. A pseudoplasmodium typically contains many thousands of individual cells. In contrast to the plasmodial slime molds, the individual cells in a pseudoplasmodium maintain their own plasma membranes during aggregation. The migrating amoebas often form beautiful aggregation patterns, which change form over time.

After a pseudoplasmodium has formed, the amoebas continue to aggregate until they form a mound on the ground surface. Then, the mound elongates into a ""slug."" The slug is typically less than 0.04 in (1 mm) in length and migrates in response to heat, light, and other environmental stimuli.

The slug then develops into a sporocarp, a fruiting body with cells specialized for different functions. A sporocarp typically contains about 100,000 cells. The sporocarp of Dictyostelium is about 0.08 in (2 mm) tall and has cells in a base, stalk, and ball-like cap. The cells in the cap develop into asexual reproductive spores, which germinate to form new amoebas. The different species of cellular slime molds are distinguished by sporocarp morphology.

Dictyostelium discoideum has been favored by many biologists as a model organism for studies of development, biochemistry , and genetics. Aspects of its development are analogous to that of higher organisms, in that a mass of undifferentiated cells develops into a multicellular organism, with different cells specialized for different functions. The development of Dictyostelium is much easier to study in the laboratory than is the development of higher organisms.

A food shortage induces aggregation in Dictyostelium. In aggregation, individual amoebas near the center of a group of amoebas secrete pulses of cAMP (cyclic adenosine-3'5'-monophosphate). The cAMP binds to special receptors on the plasma membranes of nearby amoebas, causing the cells to move toward the cAMP source for about a minute. Then, these amoebas stop moving and in turn secrete cAMP, to induce other more distant amoebas to move toward the developing aggregation. This process continues until a large, undifferentiated mass of cells, the pseudoplasmodium, is formed.

Interestingly, cAMP is also found in higher organisms, including humans. In Dictyostelium and these higher organisms, cAMP activates various biochemical pathways and is synthesized in response to hormones, neurotransmitters, and other stimuli.

The plasmodial slime molds are relatively common in temperate regions and can be found living on decaying plant matter. There are about 400 different species. Depending on the species, the color of the amorphous cell mass, the plasmodium , can be red, yellow, brown, orange, green, or other colors. The color of the plasmodium and the morphology of the reproductive body, the sporocarp, are used to identify the different species.

The plasmodial slime molds are superficially similar to the cellular slime molds. Both have a haploid amoeba phase in when cells feed by phagocytosis, followed by a phase with a large amorphous cell mass, and then a reproductive phase with a stalked fruiting body.

However, the plasmodial slime molds are distinguished from the cellular slime molds by several unique features of their life cycle. First, the germinating spores produce flagellated as well as unflagellated cells. Second, two separate haploid cells fuse to produce a zygote with a diploid nucleus. Third, the zygote develops into a plasmodium, which typically contains many thousands of diploid nuclei, all surrounded by a continuous plasma membrane.

The cytoplasm of the plasmodium moves about within the cell, a process known as cytoplasmic streaming. This is readily visible with a microscope . The function of cytoplasmic streaming is presumably to move nutrients about within the giant cell.

In nature, plasmodial slime molds grow well in wet and humid environments, and under such conditions the plasmodium of some species can be quite large. After a particularly wet spring in Texas in 1973, several residents of a Dallas suburb reported a large, moving, slimy mass, which they termed ""the Blob."" One reporter in the local press speculated that the Blob was a mutant bacterium, able to take over the earth. Fortunately, a local mycologist soberly identified the Blob as Fuligo septica, a species of plasmodial slime mold.

Another plasmodial slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, is easily grown in the laboratory and is often used by biologists as a model organism for studies of cytoplasmic streaming, biochemistry, and cytology. The plasmodium of this species moves in response to various stimuli, including ultraviolet and blue light. The proteins actin and myosin are involved in this movement. Interestingly, actin and myosin also control the movement of muscles in higher organisms, including humans.",False,False,False,20890,2339,1292040687.0,False,True

1581,4od2t,c1nbnqw,t3_gg3qv,t3_gg3qv,1301649422.0,1,"So, people ask, “do Smurfs have… you know… sex?”


The answer is an emphatic and resounding yes! And why shouldn’t they? They’re people, too. What most people don’t know is why Smurfs are blue. Well, the reason is because Smurfs only have sex once a year. Face it: if you had sex only once a year, you’d be blue, too. Once a year, in the Smurf village, flags and banners fly happily in the breeze, proclaiming that the day of the annual Smuckfest has arrived. Birds sing and the Sun comes out to watch, despite the weather-Smurf’s direst predictions. I guess good ol’ Mr. Sun is a voyeur. In the middle of town, Papa Smurf gives a brief speech explaining the origin of the Smuckfest; how Dr. C. Everett Koop came to the village and warned all the Smurfs about AIDS.


Papa Smurf knew that no one made condoms small enough for a Smurf (even though everyone knows that all male Smurfs are uniformly well-hung, for their size), so he decreed that all Smurfs would only smuck one day a year.


“Smucking one day a year will help us identify any diseases we may transmit to one another, and keep them from spreading to the animals in the forest,” declaimed Papa Smurf. “Besides, it will give Smurfette a chance to rest.”


Yes! Smurfette must rest. For, as everyone knows, Smurfette is the only female Smurf in the village, and after a full day of having vigorous, rabid sex with two hundred cunt-crazed little blue men, she needs a break.


So, on the appointed day, Papa Smurf bids everyone throw their 
inhibitions to the wind and immerse themselves in debauchery. And, as is his privilege, Papa Smurf throws out the first throe. At his signal, Smurfette unties the skintight blue band she must use to suppress her natural bustiness, and her astounding tits spring forth into the daylight. The Sun gleams lecherously on the smooth, blue flesh, nipples crinkling in the light of day from her soon-to-be-unbridled lust. Then Smurfette shimmies out of her skirt and stands before the crowd, naked as the day she was born, save the spike-heeled white boots she has donned just for the occasion. Her long, blonde hair cascades down her back and lasciviously outlines her buttocks, clinging like a dirty old man’s gaze to each curve and dimple. Her cunt winks lewdly from behind the golden shield of pubic glory, already glistening in mad anticipation of each and every raging rod it would receive that day.


And receive them gladly it would, for hers is the indefatigable furburger, and she hungered for the sauce blended in the heat of passion.


Smurfette turns to Papa Smurf and lifts her stupendous breasts with their turgid nipples to his lips. He takes each one, in turn, into his mouth, where his tongue dances the Fabulous Fandango around the areolae, as Smurfette moans like a cat in heat. Then, when poor Smurfette can take no more, Papa Smurf drops to his bony little knees and sprinkles his magic deSmurfilating dust on Smurfette’s engorged cunt lips. Presto! The lovely blonde braiding material falls from her, leaving her shaved smooth as a hard-boiled egg.


“Oh, Papa Smurf!” she cries. “Encore!! Encore!!” as she writhes in anticipation of the Fabulous Furless Fandango danced ’round her pulsating pussy.


Papa Smurf does not disappoint the damsel in distress; he slides his hands under her tight little blue ass and parts her moistness with his thumbs. As the hot, funky juices begin to run down his arms, he plunges tongue-first and tonsil-deep into her wiggling womanhood. Smurfette gasps as the talented tongue begins to do its magic, and her cunt clutches at it like a baby bird after a worm. Cradling his head to her crotch, Smurfette’s hips begin to slowly grind and twitch, for Papa Smurf’s tongue has unerringly found her S-spot, and Smurfette begins the slow, hot, agonizing rise to ecstasy.


“Oh, make me smurf, baby, make me smurf!” she pants, each stroke of his tongue causing her to throb and clutch.


As Smurfette’s moans and cries rise in pitch higher and higher, the crowd gazes in amazement at the mighty mound of meat struggling to escape from Papa Smurf’s pants. This, then, is the legendary Trouser Titan, bulging forth in a determined attempt to split the barrier. Just when Smurfette is certain that she will die from sheer sensory overload, Papa Smurf flings off his Levis and frees the Magnificent Heat-Seeking Moisture Missile from its cradle. Maddened with blind lust, Smurfette hurls Papa Smurf to the platform and leaps shrieking into the air, landing unerringly on his Titanic Totem. Suddenly filled, Smurfette’s cunt explodes in a monster orgasm, the force of which propels her screaming into the air again and again, each time plummeting her onto the Potent Purple Pecker and triggering another climax.


Before Smurfette can achieve orbit, Papa Smurf grabs her legs and pulls her to the ground. Swiftly, he stands, pulling her to her knees. Gasping in awe, Smurfette gets a head-on view of his hard-on, glistening in the light like a war staff. The sight of this shining stud is too much for Smurfette, who immediately grabs both of Papa Smurf’s bulging balls in her hands and pulls him to her waiting mouth. With preternatural skill and primeval hunger, Smurfette devours the monster cock, licking and sucking like a starving child with an ice cream cone. His ass knotting like a sailor’s anchor rope, Papa Smurf pounds into Smurfette’s mouth with furious strokes. As he reaches his blazing climax, he forces Smurfette to take all thirteen and 7/8ths inches of blue tube steak and fires round after pulsing round of blue goo down her ravenous throat.


“Hurray!!” shouts the crowd. “Now it’s our turn!!”


Suddenly the town square erupts with scenes of azure carnality, as two hundred tiny blue asses appear in the sunlight. Two hundred raging cocks swarm toward Smurfette’s waiting and ever-willing cunt, ready to make her scream for mercy as they scream for more. Four hundred bouncing balls follow each other toward the nearest available orifice, making Smurfette wish there were more of her.


Those lucky enough to find access to Smurfette’s fabulous form begin their crazed humping, as others find their schlongs being stroked as fast as she can grab. Those whose time will come later are coming now, as their friends clutch lustily at their forbidden fruits, flinging frothy fuck-foam far and wide.


Up the ass! Down the throat! Backhand, forehand, underhand, in the armpit or behind the knee, the Smurfs erupt in a display of orgasmic prowess to shame the most devoted student of the Kama Sutra. Soon the street becomes hazardous to navigate (and navigate one must), as the square gets deeper and deeper in the collective come. Hour after hour, the orgy rampages on.


Gradually, as night falls, the screams of orgasmic ecstasy turn to the moans and sighs of deep contentment, with the occasional whimper from an over-enthusiastic sodomite.


Soon all is quiet, as Smurf helps Smurf back to Home and Preparation H. 
Tubes of Chap-Stick are quickly distributed to soothe aching lips, and aloe gel is applied (as are lips, if it is too stimulating) to the citizen’s members to ease the burning. As the exhausted (and completely sated) Smurfs lie in sexual stupor, gentle rains come (not them, too!) to wash away all traces of the fleshfest that was. And you wondered why Smurfs are always in such a good mood…",False,False,False,2961,2379,1293913968.0,False,False

One time in high school we were given a social studies project where the topic was a country of ancestry.  I picked Italy which put me into a terrible group with one complete jackass who didn't care about schoolwork at all and a skater kid who was friendly and pretty smart, but not known for his academic achievements.  We split the project into three parts and I assumed that everyone would at least try to do their part.

Fast forward a week or so to the day the project is due and we have to give a presentation.  It turned out that the jackass had absolutely zero work done to contribute to the project and I started to flip out.  However, it turned out that the skater kid had actually foreseen this event and took it upon himself to do as much of the jackass's work as he could on his own without telling anyone.  He actually whispered to me that I shouldn't tell anyone what he did, I assume because it would have tarnished his image.

We ended up getting a B on the project and while I was pissed that the jackass was able to coast through, I was totally astonished that the other kid picked up the slack on his own and taken zero credit for it.",False,False,False,708215,19679,1286565713.0,False,True

I really hope someone does convince you to get off Amazon. EC2 is great for getting off the ground and/or certain types of workloads, but it's generally very costly in overhead and performance when run at scale. They are best for either edge of the bell curve: When you're just starting off and need to get something going easily and quickly; Or when you're at Netflix or Amazon scale, need a *huge* number of systems, and can effectively architect around these issues based purely on raw size. 

The problem is reddit is still in the middle of that bell curve, and you guys don't have a budget to ""overscale"" the service to maintain performance. So, the overhead of virtualization and contention of sharing resources is starting to creep into your day-to-day operation. Native, unshared hardware is really the way you should be heading. You'll get drastically more bang for your buck, and with larger providers like Rackspace or Softlayer/ThePlanet, you can get new systems online at a rate competitive with EC2 (especially for the price). Also, given the scale you'd purchase at, they'd be willing to drop the prices listed on their sites 30-40% easily.

Or even better: Buy your own hardware and colocate. It is *stupid* cheap for transit nowdays. You can find amazingly good systems builders that are building for basically the same price as a 6-9 month rental cost. You'll get far more bang for your buck. And, side bonus, you'll have something you own with actual equity. Win, win, and win.

http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gvdjk/can_we_revisit_having_some_servers_at_a_colo_in/     
     
Can we revisit having some servers at a colo in the Bay Area? I'll volunteer to go do the hands-on stuff when required if the remaining reddit admins are still afraid to travel outside SF to colos.      
     
When I mentioned this before, the response was ""we'd have to have the servers in SF because the reddit office is in SF"". I didn't understand the response at the time and the prices at many colos in SF are ridiculously high (esp. at the one where all the cool kids have their servers).

I say that the tables have turned on the cloud stuff and that it is not worth it (if it ever was in their favor in the first place). 
 With machines like the 2U Twins from supermicro that can have 2 x 12 core AMD CPUs in each of the 4 systems and built in remote console capabilities, the reliability, cost and compute power variables all favor a colo with a rack or two of these over Amazon. he.net bandwidth is $1 per Mbps, the racks are $800 or so.

Please explain to me how this Amazon crap is working out to be a better deal - I can't imagine any scenario where it is; it is like a bad joke or the stories where we keep getting told that the bankers are experts and know how to run the financial systems better than the rest of us, we keep hearing the same story from people pushing cloud systems/tools - the Amazon system doesn't work well for stuff that wants low latency - local disks are more simple, cheaper and with md/linux raid they are more reliable than ""EBS"".

Does Amazon have embarassing photos of someone high up at reddit?

Why are we still pretending this crap works, reddit is like the poster child for why cloud services suck ass.      
Please note: I am not saying the reddit software/systems/workers suck ass, I am saying that putting everything on Amazon services is causing it to suck. Like creating a refined Formula One race car engine and putting it in a Yugo with bald tires ""Y U NO win with that great engine?"".

The promise with Amazon was that you can easily bring things back online somewhere else if you have suitable copies.  Smaller sites could have spun up instances in another region when the failure looked to not be resolved in a short time.  I imagine Reddit is too large to do this with.

Amazon can definitely improve things here - as well as fixing EBS so it doesn't break, making it so you can snapshot a volume and bring it up in a totally different region would help.

* The people who posted in [/r/suicidewatch](http://reddit.com/r/suicidewatch) should always get priority access regardless of membership status.

* If only a small subset of users can be serviced, I'm ok with using Gold membership as one of the criteria for selecting the group. But It would be nice if other things are taken into consideration as well, such as number of spammers reported, frequency of votes on new stories, or the average ratio of up/down ratio for submissions. People contribute to Reddit in many ways beyond just donating money.

* Even if you're not happy with how this was handled this time, you probably should give the admins a pass. They've had a tough couple of days.

* I want to thank the Gold members for donating money to keep Reddit running.

Despite Amazon's claim that redundancy across AZs is sufficient, the disaster recovery best practice has always been that you need redundancy in a different geographical location (~1000km away). When using AWS there's got to be some common sense on the part of the customer, and not automatically believe all of Amazon's marketing material. It is more difficult to replicate across the country but still doable (but more expensive). The best practice should really be that you need redundancy across cloud providers, but that's much more difficult.

[Percentage Calc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation) Its about 4.38 hours technically.

Assuming the full Amazon downtime of 1 day, 14 hours from the uptime calc.. they owe 34 hours of downtime pro-rate.


However, Amazon is going to claim that as soon as the site was able to get ""up"", the downtime clock stops.  Even if not every volume was accessible, etc.  There are such loopholes in these contracts/SLAs.  Reddit would be lucky to be compensated for half of that.  (reading their SLA, its worse than I thought)

> *If the Annual Uptime Percentage for a customer drops below 99.95% for the Service Year, that customer is eligible to receive a Service Credit equal to 10% of their bill (excluding one-time payments made for Reserved Instances) for the Eligible Credit Period.*


It appears the max refund for any month is 10% of that month's service?  Someone please tell me this isn't true.  This is why I love Rackspace Hosting:

*Network: Five percent (5%) of the fees for each 30 minutes of network downtime, up to 100% of the fees;

Data Center Infrastructure: Five percent (5%) of fees for each 30 minutes of infrastructure downtime, up to 100% of the fees;

Migration:Five percent (5%) of the fees for each additional hour of downtime, up to 100% of the fees.*

> Computerworld - This morning's planned distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against Amazon.com by Anonymous, a hacker group that has launched similar attacks against organizations it sees attempting to censor WikiLeaks, appears to have failed.
>
Anonymous started attacking Amazon's Web site at 11 a.m. Eastern time, but it appeared to quickly abandon the effort after realizing how little impact it was having, said Paul Mutton, a security analyst at U.K.-based Internet monitoring firm Netcraft.

""The attack didn't seem to make a dent on Amazon.com,"" which is not surprising, considering Amazon's network infrastructure, he said. ""The size of [the Anonymous] botnet was not large enough to have any impact.""

One might consider that the harvesting of narwhal is in the exact sort of treacherous waters required for the harvest of king crab, and considering king crab is on the menu of every fru fru fish restaurant in North America, the absence of narwhal on North American menus speaks volumes.

If I'm not mistake you are not only hiring programmers for maintenance but marketers (or something similar) to increase revenue, correct? I seem to remember reading that somewhere. Since you can't raise capitol because you don't own the company you'd think your parent company would invest a few salaries to help maintain growth and capitalize on your explosive popularity. While I appreciate Conde Nast's limited involvement in Reddit I don't think they take you serious as a commodity. The concept of a user driven and user funded website seems contrary to a website owned by a large corporation, though Reddit seems to be both.

CDNs are overkill, and while they'd be nice, the added cost won't justify the minimal increases in performance and I don't think pushing that traffic will help them deal with database outages.

If you put all of your eggs in one basket, you are to blame. If you drink the vendors Kool-Aid, it is your own fault. This proves there is a flaw in Amazon's system. Yeah, the Dulles data center was affected, but the same thing could happen in other data centers of theirs until they fix this issue. Who knows what other flaws are out there? Who knows if they are doing proper testing to uncover issues before end users become Amazon's beta testers?

Look at Netflix, they were affected but they were so redundant across data centers that they were still able to provide mission critical services without affecting their end users.

A company I worked at previously leverages Amazon EC2. They use it to put log upload services around the globe. However, they also have their own data centers with redundancies/replication and multiple network links, global DNS, a generator, the whole nine yards. If all of Amazon went own tomorrow, they could still provide those services out of their own data center. They also do tests to simulate failures (what if scenarios). Does the hypothesis test out? Is there something we are leaving out? Proper load testing (not just testing on a 2 CPU machine for a little proof of concept).

Do they have single points of failure? Perhaps, but the CIO challenges employees to come up with scenarios that would affect the delivery of mission critical services. If any employee finds a potential gap, they got a bonus. If they offered a solution that resolves the issue, they also get a bonus. Yeah, it is their job and they work hard but the CIO nurtures a culture of accountability with incentives and penalties. If you make a mistake, learn from them. If you make a really boneheaded stupid mistake, you get a strike and enough of those and you are out of there.
