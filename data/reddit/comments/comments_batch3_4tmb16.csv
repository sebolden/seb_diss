I'd like to propose an *alternative* to /r/All, which would be something like /r/Outstanding.

Sorting by most upvotes is great. But what I would *really* want to see are those posts that really *exceed* the expectations of their respective subreddits. Let's say that /r/Pics regularly has posts that get to 5,000 points. Obviously those will show up in /r/All, even if they're nothing special. It's just because /r/Pics is so big, and the top post is bound to get that high.

But, at the same time, let's say that the /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds subreddit (not sure if that's a real thing) normally gets only 50 votes per post, but a post today got *100* votes. Whoa! *Double* what they regularly get. That must mean that it's a really good submission, right? That's the kind of content I want to see. 

The overall basis of it should be votes by percentage of subscribers, or something along those lines. it needs to take in the population of the subreddit into account. Obviously there would need to be some control (like if a submission in /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds was linked to in a popular /r/Askreddit post) to prevent brigading style stuff. But that can all be tweaked; just think about the concept.

--------

Pros of this system (as opposed to /r/All)

* Will allow for better subreddit discovery because small subreddits will be able to get on the list more easily.

* Takes away the advantage of massive default subreddits.

* Can't be dominated by one subreddit regularly, unless it continually exceeds its previous records (which would be really difficult). 

* Would really highlight the very best of Reddit or the most important news. ",False,False,1466101170.0,580051,9001,1237134866.0,False,True

What, exactly, is the difference between dominating a conversation and using the weight of your subreddit's popularity to form a majority rule?

If you don't want a subreddit with a lot of voting power to frequently rise to the top, then why do upvotes exist in the first place? 

I have never posted on the_donald, I don't like Trump, and his supporters often shit up the subs I do browse.

That said, even I think this just seems like a case of ""democracy, as long as you have the right opinions"" - the loudest, most numerous voices naturally dominate any such system and have always dominated Reddit. What is the difference between Bernie's former domination and Trump's current domination? Why is this only necessary now - with hastened deployment, no less? 

If the_donald is somehow unnaturally manipulating or gaming the system, attempt to fix that exploit. Don't respond to 'domination' with your own arbitrary heavy-handed domination right back. Again, why is diverse content only endangered now? Trump supporters are not the first political group by far to dominate Reddit - why was this not necessary during Obama's campaign?

Oh, and whilst we're on the subject of vote manipulation, unnaturally gaming the system, and so on; how about we talk about the SRS clique, their demonstrable brigading, and their hostile takeovers of other subreddits?

 It feels disingenuous given the timing to claim the changes you were attempting, including the *very* poorly thought out move to alter sticky posts, were not intended to affect that subreddit.

So then I (and many others) filtered the sub. Once filtered I was no longer providing downvotes, but lots of filtering it could be seen as a reason to not be on /r/all.

A big complaint I often read about /all is that content is voted on without context of the subreddit.  Many people attribute this to the reason why /wtf feels more like at times /im14andthisisfunny - the content is good and usually interesting, but completely wrong for the context of ""What the fuck"".  Most of the times the top posts even explain exactly ""What the fuck"" is happening in the image, but because it's a good gif/video/picture, it gets upvoted to the top through /all as opposed to people visiting the sub and voting. That's just one example, but there are MANY other subs that people attribute this to.  

With that in mind, are there any plans to do something about this?  Like maybe weigh votes through /all much lighter than a vote directly through the sub, kind of like how supposedly going through a users profile and voting on every post they've made doesn't count unless it's done in the thread directly.

Now it seems that articles stay in the top few pages, sometimes for several days. I don't consider them to be 'news' after I've seen them a few times when what I really want is for those pages to refresh and be replaced by more current and relevant articles. 

Perhaps we could have articles that hit the top few pages get cycled out to another section after a few hours, so new stories can find their way to the top. 

And I do agree about r/all -- I don't want to see the same sub getting 5 to 8 articles per page, even if it's one of my favorite subs. Perhaps you could simply limit the number of times articles from any particular sub hits the top few pages of r/all. That way more content would have the opportunity to find its way to r/all.

i certainly hope this does not imply censorship is being considered because...

>Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough.

...this would imply that reddit is working as intended. 

one of the great **killer features** of reddit is that each user can customize their experience to their own liking. each user can upvote, downvote, hide and block both users and threads, thus minimizing the need for moderation if not outright eliminating such necessity.  **EDIT:** WHOOPS didn't realize this was a feature of RES. this should be incorporated into the main site.

i certainly hope nothing is being deleted, silenced or banned by the moderators and administrators of this site.

i propose a simpler solution: 

in light of the current political atmosphere (yuck), perhaps one way to 'clean up' reddit's image (not that **i** think it needs to be cleaned up) is for controversial material to be hidden by default and only revealed to users who specifically toggle to view such material, much as nsfw images are hidden by default. 

such would create a segmentation that is user controlled so that each user can curate their experience, not some heavy handed site censor. a 'safe space' will be provided by default and those who wish to view controversial material may do so at their own choosing, and a true plurality of voices may be preserved for those who wish to view it. 

another suggestion is to provide a separate upvote / downvote counter to signal *agreement,* so that there is no confusion regarding the utility of the existing upvote / downvote system which is designed to signal *quality.*

i'm not even a donald fan. i just **LOATHE,** absolutely **LOATHE** the very idea of censorship. i feel that a change like this would preserve the basic utility of this site, so that mature content may be viewed by mature adults at their choosing, else this is not truly a site that proffers topics chosen by users for users. 

**PS:** please quit it with all the pop ups. for example, it used to be that clicking upvote an old topic would immediately bring up a small boxed-in message about the topic being too old, which is a very clean and efficient way to handle this, but now it takes the site a lengthy 5 whole seconds to dim the entire screen before a bright, white popup emerges that takes another entire 1.5 seconds to load completely and then it takes another 5 whole seconds to undim the screen once the user clicks the 'x' or 'agree'. none of this is necessary. 

this is one of the most ugly, consternating and irritating ux design choices i have ever seen, and this behavior is replicated under other conditions as well. nobody has this much time to waste. please revert this design change, thanks. ",False,False,1466132180.0,7104,14,1300551532.0,False,False

While I think the change to /r/all might be good, it might be worth considering providing the old 'hot' as an additional sorting method like 'top' and 'controversial'.

Changing the name of the default /r/all tab to something else (as others mentioned, 'outstanding', or 'front', or something), and then still providing an unfiltered 'hot' tab as one of the other additional sorting methods for /r/all would still protect the purity of the algorithm, that it is actually what is more 'hot' over all of reddit, without making it the default method for viewing /r/all.

One possible problem I see with the new system is that if say there is a major story that breaks, it becomes possible to suppress it by massively upvoting another story in the same subreddit (or upvoting another take on the same story to try to control the narrative). So providing a pure implementation of the old algorithm would help alleviate this problem.

Regarding defaults, I think there is a good argument that in order to become or remain a default they should provide some minimum level of transparency (moderation logs or something).

No, you're changing the /r/all subreddit to just ""kinda"" reflect all of what's happening on reddit. You know, controlled. You wouldn't want someone ""dominating"" the conversation. What careful, justifying, and generalizing language, making it seem like some kind of massive abuse is happening.

I noticed that all of the changes you have made recently  revolve around a core theme of stemming the flow of content in response to /r/the_donald's coverage of the Orlando terror attack, yet there is a glaring lack of accountability for the initial censorship in /r/news which sparked the out cry in the mainstream press. In that regard, I did not see one article, or hear one complaint from the userbase at large, with regards to the proliferation of the_donald's coverage of the Orlando incident; yet, somehow, it is that proliferation, rather than the glaring censorship in your default subreddit /r/news, which you choose to censure? Other than a cunning PR maneuver, what drives you to act in such a manipulative way while representing reddit inc to your own user base?

Other than a comment as to how the /r/news mod who told a user to kill themselves was unacceptable behavior, you have said nothing regarding the wider community backlash in relation to the effects of the wanton removal of comments and submissions during a developing situation, and how such actions inhibited the flow of information to an extent that could have potentially resulted in actual harm (removal of blood donation information); please address why you feel it is acceptable for moderators to curtail the flow of information during such events in a manner dictated by their ideological purview rather than the safety of the general public at large.

I understand your want to make r/all a more broad representation of everything  available on reddit, but I feel that you are treading in the black waters of censorship. And in the case of r/the_donald, political censorship.

As this is an election year, we should expect political advocacy to be an overbearing part of the activity on reddit.  Once the election is over, I would expect political advocates to almost disappear from r/all.  This rise and fall of activity would be natural.

When Bernie sanders propaganda was plastered all over r/all, there was no action to manipulate the algorithms on your part, and yet, when it appeared that Bernie support was not strong enough to secure the democratic nomination,  the activity of his supporters naturally declined.  To the point where I see almost no Bernie posts on r/all.  This was a natural rise and fall.

Unfortunately, your choice to manipulate the natural activity of the site behind the scenes feels a bit big brother.  If I don't like seeing r/the_donald all over my reddit, I have the choice to filter them.  It should be MY CHOICE, not yours.

The timing of your actions, and your specific reference, as a response to r/the_donald, makes these changes feel partisan on your part.  Reddit is already overly tilted to the left and you are only re-inforcing an already unbalanced forum.  This plays directly into the accusations of thought control and political censorship.

I would hope that you would attempt to be unbiased and that you would truly support free speech.  Unfortunately, the appearance, whether intended or not, seems to indicate that you have chosen manipulation, political censorship, and partisanship.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.....

Though I may weigh the upvotes differently.
Lessening the added weight if more posts from one subreddit are present could represent the general interest in a false way.

For example the_donald has 2 trending topics:

1. Trump is actually mexican
2. Trump wins Wimbledon Tennis tournament

I'm guessing both would trend pretty heavy across the internet and all interests and if I check r/all it's really just to get an overview of trending posts of subs I'm not subscribed too.

Lessening one for the other would decrease my chance to see both, just because they come from the same subreddit.

Karmanaut's suggestion is good, but you could game that, and I think the overhaul you described in the post is trying to prevent certain devoted subreddits to game the system.

You could count the % of users who clicked on the link and the upvoted from the % click total of each subreddit to promote a post to r/all.


Then count % of users who clicked and upvoted on the post in r/all && who are not subscribed to the originating subreddit 3,4x to add weight and determening how long a post stays on r/all.

**Hypothetical Scenario**

`Post A` is posted about a breaking story about some important news, within the subreddit alone (before it reaches /r/all), it reaches 1500 upvotes in an hour and starts appearing on /r/all, which then increases it's upvotes to 3000 upvotes. 

`Post B` is posted as a correction and important update to `Post A`, and within the subreddit (again, before reaching all), it reaches 2000 upvotes (so quite a bit more than the original), but because `Post A` is so hot on /r/all, `Post B` doesn't get exposed to /r/all until much further down (based on how I understand what you described), thus not gaining the additional bump in hotness from the /r/all readers that it would need to overtake `Post A`. 

**So my questions would be**

1. Do you guys have any systems in place that would discredit some of the additional 'hotness' a thread gets just by being exposed to /r/all when comparing its relative-to-subreddit 'hotness'? So in the scenario above, would `Post A` start to delay on /r/all and `Post B` would move up to take it's place, even though it has less upvotes?

2. If not, do you think it's something that should be considered?

3. And does the relative-to-subreddit hotness decay at the same rate as normal hotness? Because I could see that causing 1 big post totally muffling other significant posts that happen later in the day, that are equally or more important.

I'm sorry but wouldn't that mean **not** manipulating the front page? 

I know a lot of people do not like /r/The_Donald but people need to realize a couple of things. There are ways to block sub-reddits, so if you really just cant stand them you never have to see a post from them again. Second, /r/The_Donald wasn't, isn't, really doing anything wrong when it comes to getting so many post on the front page. Their users just **actually use** the upvoting system. If reddit as a whole was to actually upvote things they like /r/The_Donald wouldn't exist. Generally speaking though, and I'm just as guilty of this, I see something I like and just keep scrolling. Third, what happens when this kind of thing back fires, as its already done with /r/EnoughTrumpSpam? If post are ""auto down voted based on doing well in the past"" what happens when a lot of subs, such as /r/sexyabortions, /r/TheRedPill, /r/bestiality or /r/Music gets something upvoted disproportionately and main subs such as /r/cats cant upvote enough to suppress it? What happens when other sites, such as 4chan, or trolls take advantage of this and the front page is filled with literal shit? EDIT: Adding, after reading a comment, what happens when **we do** want spam from a sub like what we should of got from /r/news but didnt because they were deleting everything? 


This seems like a very slippery road to be on where we're in a car that every time you use a function, such as the brakes or steering, the functionality is slowly diminished until it no longer functions.

The biggest change I've always wanted to see (and it'd be a big one) would be forcing controversial-sort for comments. 

If everyone downvotes a comment, it's assholish/stupid/irrelevant, and not interesting.

But imho, if everyone upvotes a comment, it's circlejerky and not interesting either.

But a comment that generates a lot of opinion *and* divides it evenly... that's interesting almost by definition. Maybe take child-comment count into consideration also (although that could be risky).

I know you can always sort comments individually, but what I'm looking for is the cultural shift it would bring, and that only happens if everybody does it.

No more whining about downvotes. No more glib karmawhoring. No more hivemind. Instead of rewarding people for saying popular things, you'd reward them for getting to the crux of issues. The first things people see on opening a thread are the ones that make them think, and if they want their response to be prominent, they will need to make others think too instead of just tossing off a one-liner or saying what people want to hear. 

Voting would be a lot freer - downvote-to-disagree would be entirely valid. Not that it isn't now, but ehh. Reasonable people can reasonably disagree and all that.

Maybe this could be done on a per-sub basis, at least. It would make less sense in support subs, but imagine how it would transform /r/politics...

I don't want to share my experience with the majority of Reddit partly because I distrust the majority opinion of users, and partly because I do not share their interests in most activities.

My distrust for users stems from a belief that users of the site, who are demographically similar to myself, are misusing the forum as a way to support negativity. I believe critics at r/shitredditsays are on point in criticizing users for promoting casual racism and sexism. It seems to me if there are more people to listen there will be more tyranny of the majority- so the dregs of our community often rise up on the most popular posts. I think downvotes and moderation are inadequate to prevent the wholesale bigotry found on this site- so long as toxic communities are allowed to exist they will congregate and infest r/all.

I originally joined Reddit precisely because there are places here where I'm not part of the ""all,"" where I'm an important member of a smaller communities with specialty taste. I have no interest in advice animals, atheist memes, hackneyed askreddit threads, or curated AMAs. I want this site to be inclusive, and that means making it a safe place for people who aren't privileged white men. I do not think, as long as r/all exists in anything resembling its current form, that we will be welcoming to the wholesome visitors we want.

I've said some shady and hurtful things in comments here myself, I'm a part of the problem in that sense. I only recently have felt culpable for what I said, but I feel the majority of redditors will never take responsibility for what they have said because this is a place they (wrongfully) believe anything is allowed.

Honestly, that's just showing you're biased as fuck and admitting it's about them.

We weren't trying to dominate the conversation anymore than r/SandersForPresident were trying to.

You're angry that people of Reddit aren't falling into line with your own personal political beliefs and you're changing the system. You are and you have been allowing them to get brigaded by other subs.

You don't create a very interesting or useful website when you allow such things to happen and blatantly support a political bias. This place is about subreddits and communities that grow from them, not about trying to shut down people who have different beliefs.

Well since r/donald was being constantly brigaded since before it ever reached all. Admins have never addressed the issue, and any comment on any post is immediately downvoted into oblivion before brought back up by the community there.

For example, if someone only upvotes one post on a subreddit (per time periods, let's say per day), that vote would count 100%, But if they upvote two, then their vote will have a diminishing positive contribution.. the exact quantity can be determined by your data people, but for the sake of example, let's say 80% 80%, then 63% 63% 63%, 50%x5 and so on. Therefore, if someone is sitting there blanket upvoting everything on a sub, their opinion will ultimately be diluted. I feel this is more democratic than simply penalizing stuff on r/all and that it will achieve the ""diverse"" front page content you are asking for.

This calc would go in BEFORE you normalize the entire subreddits themselves.

Of course you would also keep track of unweighted upvotes, for the purposes of r/front and this would still just be for r/all.

Also, I think downvotes need to be removed completely. Upvotes alone should be to stratify the quality of the comments and posting.

What you are doing is not making reddit a better place.

Call it censoring, sure, you don't have to, though, if it helps you sleep: either way you are literally filtering access to information.

No matter what model you chose to filter content, or to add more ""variety,"" there will never truly be trust among the users of reddit, because every one of us, who still stand to question, will wonder if what we are reading, second after second, minute after minute, etc, is tailored for us, or manipulated.

Content, /r/the_don etc, deserves to be downvoted to hell, if the users chose that fate. The don also deserves to be upvoted into oblivion, at the will of the users of Reddit.

When it began, Reddit was unique in that it was organically and without agenda a true representation of what people wanted to talk about.

It was supposed to be so simple- the more upvotes and comments something has the more people would see it, and in theory the masses determine what the conversation should be about, WITHOUT interference from the typical motivators that permeate our daily receipt of information, such as money, greed and political agenda.

We now have these ""changes"" to the algorithms that are looking to take away the ONE thing that made reddit so unique and fantastic. It was ours, as a world and as a community to use as our own way to disseminate and receive information. It's been infiltrated by other outside factors, and I find that while it was inevitable, it is incredibly sad. 

If r/all is filled with political posts from Bernie or Trump supporters, or filled with pictures of cats playing with toys or Futurama memes or anything else, that is because those things have EARNED their way there, like it or not. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE UPVOTING AND WANTING TO SEE.

If someone has a problem with a Bernie message then maybe the problem isn't with r/all but instead with a person who feels themselves entitled to a world where they get only the content that THEY want delivered. Oh wait- that exists. It's called subscribing to your own subs. What some are essentially saying is that they want not only the right to see the content that THEY want- they want OTHER people to only see the content that they want. What is that about ?

Luckily, there is a need for the rawness that Reddit was designed to provide. A place where you can laugh, cry, keep up to date on your hobbies, ask for advice, kick, scream, yell, discuss, posit and debate whatever you want. Another platform will rise up to fill that need of the population. 

Regretfully in my opinion, it won't be Reddit.

Reddit needs to understand that there are older folks that WANT to absorb the news and knowledge from a reliable and trust-worthy site. However, it's difficult for them because all they see are pictures of seductive goats and a shower thought concerning The Rock, and they have NO IDEA how they can get rid of it. The best recent move Reddit made was removing AdviceAnimals from default. And before someone chimes in, if I told someone ""Read the FAQ"", I think I would get punched in the face.

The Reddit mods need to step into everybody's shoes and understand that people's exposure to computers/technology is widely varied. They need to make ease & accessibility to the site as simple as possible without losing the charm. Something to the effect of this customization would be nice:


* All-inclusive (default subscriptions as it is now)
* Math, Science, & Technology (dataisbeautiful, technology, futurology, science, etc.)

Ok spez, sure. There wasn't a problem in the first place. Reddit users took care of it by downvoting or upvoting.

There are two possible interpretations of this:

A. Somehow /r/The_Donald is getting their stuff to the front page without anyone voting for it (e.g. vote manipulation)  
B. A large portion of reddit does actually like /r/The_Donald, and the admins think *that* is the problem.  

In neither case does changing the rules seem to make sense.  The solution to A. is to get better tools for detecting vote manipulation, doing anything else is just a band-aid.  The solution to B. is ""tough, deal with it.""  Reddit is supposed to be community driven, but changing rules because B is the opposite of that.

I don't see it that way. /r/the_Donald wasn't merely presenting opinions that were ideologically unappreciated by some people (though they were doing that). They were deliberately upvoting shitposts like crazy in order to brag about the total number of posts from their sub that were on the front page. 

Generally the shittier the post from /r/the_Donald the more likely it would be upvoted like crazy. The Sanders' sub dominance on /r/all was a problem (I say this as a Sanders fan), but they didn't aggressively upvote content-free pictures of centipedes, ugly pictures of Hilary, or cleavage-tastic Sanders' supporters with Sanders foam trucker hats on. They didn't try derogate entire nationalities, ethnic and religious groups, or foreigners in general by selectively finding bad examples of target groups and implying that the entire group could be stereotyped based on the worst examples from that group.

Crap that /r/the_Donald would upvote included:

SJW trigger posts that contained a picture and perhaps a phrase intended to piss off people with differing views. Generally the intent to piss off SJWs was explicitly listed in the title of the post or provided in text over the image itself.

Triptych-type posts which featured one picture broken into 3 images that could be uploaded in the correct order so the picture could be seen in its completeness on the front page.

Confirmation bias posts. That is, finding examples of bad behavior among groups /r/the_Donald hates (e.g. SJWs, Muslims, trans individuals, etc.) and then generalizing from those specific instances to the entire group. That is exactly the best way to increase prejudice and stereotyping: look for negative examples of the outgroup, ignore negative examples of the ingroup, then generalize from specific instances to an entire population.

As much of a problem as the Sanders movement posed to the front page, they were more about pushing pro-Sanders content (often not shitposts).  /r/the_Donald was more interested in promoting shitposts to upset people and assert their dominance. 

Simply go to /r/the_Donald now and look at the top 20 posts and compare that to the top 20 posts in /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/SandersForPresident/. The differences are not merely about world view (thought that is certainly the case). The style of posts is radically different. /r/the_Donald's content is actually more similar to that found in /r/AdviceAnimals. Stupid images with maybe a sentence of throw-away content on top.

So the fact is, /r/the_Donald differs from nearly all other political subs both in content AND in style of communication. While you can argue that /r/the_Donald is catching heat for their worldview alone, there is plenty of evidence that /r/the_Donald is catching heat solely for their style of communication.

Spez, like many leaders in social media, are increasingly putting their moral politics before any kind of business acumen. The psychological effect of seeing opposing politics becomes too strong for them to ignore or deal with rationally. 

That's why you have public media pundits have embarrassing twitter meltdowns at egg account trolls and shitposters, or journalists frequently shutting down comments in a big huff and turning increasingly radicalized in their ideology. Or just look at any forum moderator or admin drama. They all get unstable after a while. They're not thinking about revenue, or being some sane rational media voice. They're now all just hyper-politicized wrecks waiting to explode. 

Major media sites are also turning more and more towards certain practices and ""content curation"" leaning towards one left-center-leaning ideology in particular. The holes left in their wake are quickly filled up to the brim with massively concentrated activity from the now-neglected demographics - ie. the_donald, Breitbart, Milo, etc. You would think one would want to reap revenue form ALL those demographics, but in a politicized market, even the most all-powerful all-encompassing companies cannot find a way to do it. So they shed them aside because it's the ""correct"" thing to do, which will get them lots of PR headlines from the unstable ideological media journalists and authorities in the third paragraph.

They said sure, the aforementioned mod wrote up a few paragraphs and they made us subreddit of the day the next day.

That doesn't matter though because we had been brigaded by The_Donald at least since the day before. There were multiple threads and comments on The_Donald pointing out that our subreddit existed and some were upvoted into the thousands.

We only made it to /r/all *after being made SotD.*

In other words, your assertions are the ones that ""simply do not seem to correlate with reality.""

TL;DR:

* The_Donald brigading of ETS began the day before ETS was made SotD.

* Multiple comments/threads on The_Donald advocated the brigading of ETS, some highly upvoted the day before ETS was made SotD.

* The day the brigading started in ETS an ETS mod sent a message to the SotD mods asking to be made SoTD, they agreed.

* The next day ETS was made SotD, brigading went up to 11.

The problem is with how reddit is used. If I see something I don't like, I just keep scrolling. Some idiot posting shit I don't agree with isn't worth my time to stop scrolling and click the downvote button, let alone responding to. 

So a loud minority can get their stuff voted to the top, and if their opinions are idiotic enough, most people just avoid the whole thing because getting involved with idiots is a waste of time.

So reddit's voting scheme sends extreme views to the top, but moderate views aren't ever going to be represented because moderates don't feel strongly enough to post opposing viewpoints.

* subreddit votes on post

Will having the opportunity to filter content mean that unfiltered /r/all will be even more shitty for non-filter users? What impact will a filtering feature have on people visiting the site for the first time (i.e., people who don't have the shit filters already set up)?

If 10k users categorically upvote subreddit X, while every other subreddit has at most 1k users categorically voting up its content, then the front page will be mostly X with a few outstandingly popular posts from other subs.

Then add in that some subreddits attract particularly unified voting blocs, so a sub like /r/Eyebleach with 185k subscribers has a front page with maybe a ~100 point median, while The_Donald has ~165k subscribers and its front page never seems to dip below 2000 points.

I beg to differ, what s4p was doing was actually worse because his group of followers used reddit to literally fund a good percentage of his campaign. It was obvious to all of us. The question is, why was this blatant pan-handling allowed to occur without consequences for months, while the trump sub gets the axe so quickly for ""spamming""? Not to mention how much s4p would brigade other pro Clinton posts/subs. Yes I did notice this with my eyes.

Come on, you don't need to read between the lines to see what is happening here and I'm getting fed up with it.

Rotating defaults have been one of the solutions proposed for far longer then 11 months, heh. :) I think I may have even suggested myself nearly a half decade ago. The problem with that solution now, however, is how to choose? An algorithm based on hotness/popularity/subscribers/pageviews/comments? That could be easily gamed/manipulated as evidenced by couple instances from reddit's early days when defaults *were* based on activity... So then what, have the admins choose? I think the whole issue with that is that the admins are looking for a solution that takes the human element out of it all together. I assume that's their primary goal based on their recent statements and how/why they basically stopped adding/changing the defaults over the last year or so (despite making the initial attempt a few years back). 

I'm a bit of a pragmatist/realist myself, I'm one of the rare few who actually think the current default subreddit system is quite good for what it does. I think it's the best solution with the least drawbacks. And there's some evidence to support that -- it has served reddit well over the years; if it was a poor solution, reddit would not have grown to be the 9th largest website in the U.S (and is still growing).

one, an algorithm that'll compare the up vote numbers of similarly-named subreddits before considering em for the front page. so if tinysub was up to x amount of votes for submissions, othertinysub won't get anything promoted until it tops tinysub's numbers.  

if tinysub and othertinysub are legit for different topics and content, they can submit their differences to the mods. if if doesn't look cut and dry, you have a couple other mods of unrelated subs weigh in.  

two, you run something to track syncing of up/down group votes by actual users. if a few dozen/hundred/thousand users all vote similarly in the same place, the algorithm notices and checks to see if that same grouping of votes appears anywhere else on reddit. and if so, it alerts a mod. 

so when tinysub games the front page for a couple weeks. they switch to othertinysub in hopes of gaming anew, but soon realize they're being held back on the sub they just abandoned. so they talk about it and start smallsub. that doesn't trigger the first algorithm, but the fact that these same users all started voting similarly in smallsub all of a sudden will alert the algorithm for further review.  

this would also cut back on vote brigading. if a bunch of users from one sub collectively bounce all over reddit around the same time, someone or something gets to check it out.

I see you **barely** have more downvotes than upvotes(~mid 60s according to my screen)  and considering just how left-biased this site's administration is I think that speaks quite well of your post which calls them out on their outright shady censorship, cowardice, and blatant political bias. I mean this site has straight up admitted to altering up/downvotes behind closed doors(**I am sure this isn't a recipe for abuse, as nah, humans do super great when given unlimited power they can wield behind closed doors and never have to answer to their actions in public**). So, honestly, who could ever trust ANYTHING on this site any longer?

/u/spez and the entirety of Reddit's administration have shown their true colors. They have shown they are nowhere close to being above the use of cowardly, fascist tactics to ensure their preferred political agenda is the only agenda promoted through a site that purports itself to be a site where only the users decide what content makes it to the top of the site. THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE 100% FULL OF DOGFLOP! THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ADMIN STRAIGHT UP ANNOUNCING THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER GOING TO ALLOW USERS TO DECIDE WHAT MAKES IT TO THE TOP, AT LEAST NOT WHEN IT CONFLICTS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLITICAL AGENDA!

One might as well go hang out on the ""Daily Kos"", ""media matters"", ""WeAreSoLiberallyBiasedWeWillEvenDiscriminateAgainstTheLGBTCommunityIfForcedToChooseAgainstALiberalConcernWhichRanksAnOrderOfMagnitudeHigherOnOur""LiberalPriorityList"".org message boards at this point.


**Bernie Sanders dominates /r/all for MONTHS but, the second their preferred Presidential candidate is proven to not be anywhere close to as popular as Donald Trump is it is all of a sudden time to hurry up and change how the entire site operates!** Afterall they must ensure, by hook or by crook(ed Hillary), that they change the rules as much as needed whatever it takes to get their preferred, far-leftist content to the front page. **This is 100% against what this site is stated to be about.**

**The administration's actions on this website are outright disgusting to me and they should also be to anyone else who gives even the slightest of shits about censorship and who are anti-corruption and/or fans of justice.**

It is outright politically motivated horseshit. Like most of the media, in relatively recent times at least, this site is now not even trying to be subtle about their EXTREME and blatant biases which they promote.

**I loved coming to Reddit but I cannot in anyway whatsoever support this fascist garbage any longer.**

I am done with reddit and ALL of their sponsors -- voat.co(https://voat.co/) appears to be a solid, at the very least temporary, alternative.

**Ninja:** **Anyone not sure if I am full of shit or the Admins are full of shit?**

**Use the SRS subreddit as a barometer.**

As long as **reddit is actively ignoring massive amounts of not even subtle rule breaking** in order to allow one of the most politically extreme subs out there to ACTIVELY BRIGADE(you know, break one of Reddit's most basic rules on a consistent basis) it is a great, incontrovertible indication that shows us they are openly allowing their political biases to control how they run a site that was supposed to be a reflection of their users and NOT the admin's personal political grandstand.

I'm not really happy with it at all. I have the front page as my place for things I am interested in and higher quality content. And I go to /r/all to get the stupid shit reddit loves: ""funny"", pics, memes, etc. And recently, I've used filtered /r/all to get rid of all the garbage that's been clogging it up.

But a filtered /r/all where only one post from /r/funny or /r/pics shows up sucks in my mind, and is defeating the purpose of me going there. I'm glad for everyone else that there will be less objectionable content, but this is overall a worse change.

And like many changes on reddit, it's a patch sewn over a festering wound that fails to address the real problem: when a small but dedicated group of people work together, they can push a post to the top of /r/all *very* easily.

*  Sanders spam starts overwhelming r/all
*  Reddit admins begin working on a new r/all/hot algorithm
*  Sanders spammers get bored and go away, Trump spammers learn how to use opposable thumbs and begin spamming
*  Reddit admins finish coding and roll out new algorithm
*  Reddit users think Reddit admins are reacting solely to Trump spam

Maybe it happened like that, maybe not.  Just because Trump spam was the straw that broke the camel's back, doesn't mean that other subs weren't already breaking the rules.  Just because we don't see the results doesn't mean the admins weren't already acting.

That's because you're filtering using RES, which does the filtering *after* the posts have already been sent to your browser. If you use the reddit gold filtering (which, like spez says, we're planning to make available for everyone soon), your pages will still be the full size because the filtering is done server-side before sending to you.

/r/funny and /r/AdviceAnimals are chock full of shitposts just like /r/the_Donald, but at least they aren't deliberately trying to be offensive (or dominate the front page). Generally their shitposts attempt (and fail) to be funny. And generally they tend to upvote high quality content more than low quality content (the opposite strategy as that used by /r/the_Donald).

Imagine if there was a sub that, due it their interest in having fun, constantly stayed on the lookout for negative stories about people in wheelchairs and then made fun of those people by posting nearly content free shitposts. When called out for their behavior their response was, ""it's just a prank, bro."" 

Well that hypothetical situation seems awfully similar to the actual situation over in /r/the_Donald (except the targets are different). /r/the_Donald tried really, really hard to offend people in /r/all and they succeeded.

Because mods in 4chan started cracking down on what gets posted there. *see my previous comment*

>People love Reddit because it draws huge crowds.

What drove me to Reddit was because Digg got mismanaged. The same thing has been happening here over the last couple years. I've been going to Voat off and on as Reddit gets worse and worse. I feel the smaller a community is, the better it is. The larger the community, the more shit you get. If the Great Digg Migration happens again, Voat will be the next site and all the same things will happen there over its lifespan.

>I'm just curious, which action should the mods take in order to keep the masses coming to Reddit that won't alienate the bullies, trolls and spammers?

I wish I had an answer for that; Personally, I think websites such as 4chan, Reddit, Voat, et al are doomed to fail because people just can't get along. In our everyday lives, we have the ability to surround ourselves with those that maybe not agree with 100% of everything we do/say, but we can get pretty close to it.

Now, it would be great if the admins could make progress against the bot-voting rather than adjust the algorithm, but it's all the same -- they can adjust how the algorithm creates emergent patterns, or they can target the patterns in the voting and nullify votes.

Seeing

/r/SandersForPresident  on the other hand...every post is literally the fucking same, it's cringy as fuck and frontpage **seemed like I was on some kind of Sanders crazy cult website**.

>Would like to point out a few things wrong with this. 

>First disliking feminism is not misogyny.

>Second, by literally putting nothing as your description other than ""Hello, I am a feminist"" is just asking for this (Before you call this victim blaming she is actually asking for this, she goes in looking to provoke negative responses, not only is that what the point of this experiment is, her replies to even more innocent messages are trying to provoke negative responses) By putting this there she is saying ""Hello, literally the only important thing about myself is feminism"" that is the only information she is putting forward, anybody with half a brain knows this is either a very radical feminist who actually only has an identity of being a feminist, or someone baiting trolls, which is what this actually was.

>Third, tinder has a big culture of fucking with people, if you go look at /r/tinder the most upvoted content is either joke profiles or conversations fucking with people with nudes and hookups scattered in there occasionally.

>Fourth, as I said earlier this is literally the only piece of information offered, if she had perhaps had a realistic profile talking about hobbies, job, education, shitty pseudo deep shit that most people have come to expect and casually mentioned feminism it would have likely been a normal tinder experiment.

>Fifth, as far as experiments go, this one does not have a control set, with either no bio or a normal bio, so there is no point of reference.

>So lets go through these conversations one by one.

 >1. ""White men are under attack right now"", this is quite obviously the case where the guy could tell this was a troll account and decided to have some fun by throwing out the most inflammatory comment they could to an account that seemed to be fishing for inflammatory comments.

 >2. ""Worst bio possible : good luck"": Well this showed the guy was correct, the bio was literally worse than having put nothing there, it is intended to be that way, he is actually offering constructive criticism here. Also her response once again makes the statement that disagreeing with feminism is misogynist, that is not what that word means.

> 3. ""Why are you on tinder if you're a feminist"" So clearly this guy misunderstands the goals and viewpoints of general feminists, he very likely was asking a legitimate question as he was confused by what he saw as conflicting images. Once again her response is way out of proportions but I will skip that one as I can understand how that comment could be seen as inflamatory and I can't definitely say it wasn't meant to be.

> 4. This is kind of standard tinder behavior, this is a hookup app and things like this come with the territory, this is in no way targeted at her being a feminist.

 >5. This guy is offering legitimate advice again, and nothing is targeted at her being a feminist. He is certainly not saying this like she needs his approval, both incidents of advice being offered have been because on tinder you have very limited information to use to sell yourself with and both guys have simply been giving her advice on how to better sell herself. She then gets extremely offended at this, to which he responds relativly calmly, and she again respondes heavily agitated which confirms that she is either batshit crazy or baiting responses so he stops messaging.

 >6. Another guy who sees a troll account and decides to make the most inflamatory statement possible. This is once again because the profile was obviously bait.

 >7. This is once again another standard tinder experience, nothing to do with saying she is a feminist. To give her credit she didn't try to make this one into a feminist thing and just dismissed the creep like most tinder users.

 >8. This could once again be trolling, or the guy is legitimately into being a sub and saw someone so openly disclosing their interest in the empowerment of women might be into dominating, so he asked. Him asking a second time is once again common on tinder, not saying it is good but it is once again the nature of the app and not specific to her being a feminist.

> 9. Once again someone saw a clear troll account and said the most offensive thing possible. 

> 10. Although his opening line is a bit cringey he is legitimately trying to start a conversation off of the only information she has provided, and trys to carry on after as a normal conversation, she does nothing to try to actually talk to the dude here when he clearly is doing his best to get to know more about her.

> 11. Once again constructive criticism because the profile is truly awful.

> 12. Someone who actually is interested in her feminism and wants to talk about and perhaps debate their opposing view points, she immediately finds offense, he sees she is an extremist or a troll and stops responding. 

>So most of these are actually people trying to be helpful or start a discussion which she finds a way to take offense to immediately immediately putting off anyone, after which they stop talking or proceed to fuck with her because why not, thats a big part of tinder's subculture.

>A few were people who immediately saw her as an extremist they would have no interest in or a troll and just decided to mess with her.

>Some were just regular tinder shit, creepy dudes and dick pics.

>I'm sure I will probably get downvoted for this but whatever, felt like typing it up.

yeah, I think its the same general idea.

Maybe there should be a term for ""person who is far in that direction on that axis"", which is neutral on where the person is on other axes. It seems like such a term would have good uses.

If people would consistently use such a term in a way that is neutral on other axes, I think that would make it a useful term.

I am not opposed to what reddit is doing here, at least as far as I understand it, but I do think that private companies have a role to play in free speech.

uh, Warning: This comment is partially to help me think this topic through myself, so it isn't the most concise it could be for the ideas it expresses.

ISPs, well, I guess those are considered utilities, so that might be kind of different, but

Imagine an isp refused to provide service to people who would use it to, e.g. claim that blue is the objectively best color online. This would be very bad. (Well, I mean, in the case of whether blue is the best color, that question isn't super important, but ISPs being permitted to do things LIKE that would be very bad)

now, reddit is quite different from an ISP, and isn't really a utility, but it is more similar to a utility than the comment section on my personal blog is, for example.

If reddit was pretty much the only thing like it, and it was completely infeasible for effective competitors to spring up, due to e.g. extreme network effects (this is not the case currently. There are viable alternate things which are have communities, and are similarish.) , then I could see there being an argument for reddit in that situation being kind of like a utility, and have some more obligations towards free speech. I'm not totally certain of this, but it seems plausible is what I'm saying.

Even without that though, I think there is probably some amount of responsibility that reddit has, kind of. (but not one that I think they are failing to uphold at the moment. I'm not criticizing reddit as it currently is, just saying that I think there are some responsibilities towards free speech that it has, and that if it failed in these responsibilities that would be worthy of criticism)

Like, consider Facebook. If Facebook attempts to restrict what stories get seen, but also hide the fact that they do that at all, I think that would be bad, and that part of the reason it would be bad would be because of it going against free speech. I don't know that it would be, like, ""legally bad"", but I think it would go against personal responsibility.

One question is, what determines what level of (personal/non-legal) responsibility a website has protecting free speech, and how does a site like facebook or reddit differ from the comment section on someone's personal blog. Or, what about something which is like facebook or reddit in the type of site it is, but the number of users is more like that of someone's personal blog? Would that case be more similar to the personal blog, or more similar to the large social network thing?

I think I feel that it would be more like the personal blog? This seems like it might suggest that the responsibility is related to the number of users, not the type of site that it is. Or perhaps, rather than the number of users, the proportion of potential users?

One question is whether, even in a personal blog comment section, whether the blog owner, if they do remove comments that they don't want people seeing, but which aren't spam, whether they have an obligation to at least not specifically try to hide the fact that they do so.

If so, then maybe the obligations are more based around not being deceptive than based in protecting free speech?

Hmm, that seems like a good argument, but its not one that I really, want to be convinced by?

No, I still think that if a website is sufficiently important to people communicating with each other, that those that control the website have some amount of personal responsibility towards free speech, which doesn't go away even if they are clear that they do not intend to uphold it.

If you ISP tells you upfront that they will censor anything they want to, that doesn't make it ok for them to do that.

And similarly, if a website or any other service is so central to communication that there are no reasonable alternatives, then even if they are not legally classified as a utility, but are instead classified as merely a private company, then even if they try to disclaim it, they still have some personal responsibility towards free speech.

And, though I'm slightly less sure of this, I think that if they aren't quite that central, but are still close, they still have some personal responsibility towards free speech, just probably not as much of one.",False,False,False,14426,585,1423783812.0,False,True

Are we seriously still obsessing over Benghazi? Newsflash, she didn't kill anyone. If you're going to blame the death of an ambassador on the administration or the cabinet..... how many were killed under Bush? At least 40, IIRC.

>The political rhetoric trying to tarnish Trump's name

Trump's tarnishing his *own* name, he doesn't need anyone to do that for him.

>Ok I get it, Trump comes across as an egostistical jerk to you folks but get over yourselves.

Racist, sexist, liar, and all around asshole who has an unfavorability rating more than any candidate that's ever preceded him, especially among women and the minorities (and yes, I mean the ones legally registered to vote, before you try that argument), two groups he *actually needs* if he wants to stand a chance. But it's too late for that. Honestly I don't even think he believes half the shit he says, but he's playing this ridiculous character people like Palin and Bachmann did for real because he knows it will get the Republicans to like him. Of course that's not working out so well because now the Conservative members of the House are calling him out, especially after the shit with the Hispanic judge. The American people just don't want him. The RNC doesn't want him. The only ones who want him are the ones who are still buying into his bullshit about how Mexicans and Muslims are apparently the two greatest threats to the entire world. He dodges every question with vague answers à la Romney only more nonsensical. Every time someone says something he doesn't like, he has a little fit. He is a child and not fit to lead a country.

>The guys platform for securing our boarders and bringing jobs back America is exactly what this country needs.

""If you build a wall, they'll dig tunnels."" And for that matter, *what platform*, what exactly *are* his plans? He's bankrupted numerous of his own business to escape debt. You can't do that with a country and expect it to work. He's not a politician. He's not a world leader, nor does he have the experience to be one. He's a businessman, and a failed one at that.

>Democrats in the past 36 years have basically dominated the presidential race.

What in the holy fuck are you talking about? 36 years ago was 1980. That was eight years of Reagan, four years of H.W. Bush, and eight years of W. Bush following Bill Clinton. *Twenty* of the last 36 years, we've had a Republican president. What kind of math did they teach you in school?

>We are not getting any safer from terrorist attacks

Kicking Muslims out of the country will not solve that. As Obama had to say very clearly in a short speech less than a week ago, there are over one and a half *billion* people of the Islamic faith in the world. The amount that actually have any ties to terrorist organizations is [less than 0.01% of that](https://www.quora.com/How-many-extremist-Muslims-are-there-when-compared-with-the-wider-and-world-wide-Muslim-population). Oh and look up Ted Kaczynski and Robert Lewis Dear Jr. while I have your attention. Just so you have some examples of terrorists with *zero* ties to Islam.

The moment you make Islam out to be a religion of terror, or the moment you make ISIS to be a group that speaks for the whole of Islam, is the moment you play right into their (the extremists') hands. It makes their cause seem religious, when it's really just based on hatred. The numbers just don't agree with these claims.

Apparently it's *not* a matter of course *since it doesn't effing happen.* SRS uses a bot that screensshots the linked posts at the time of posting. That way, you can see the original number of upvotes. Most of the time, the number goes UP after it's linked to SRS! 

If it goes down (which is unusual), admins  can see whether it was due to people coming from SRS. And, surprise! *IT'S NOT*.

I am 100% sure that there are some users who sit in /new of the_donald and downvote everything (as with many polarising subreddits). But

a) I think you're way overestimating the effect of brigaders. That post I linked above was on ~75% at ~950 point when I visited /r/all (and rose some more from there). It's now on 52%. Seems pretty likely that the change came from voters on /r/all, supporting spez's statement.

b) The post I linked talks about admin conspiracy, not brigading.

Let's do a thought experiment, just for my curiosity. Let's say for the sake of the argument that the post I linked got 45% downvotes from 'general reddit population' and 3% from people sitting in 'new' (that we accept as an inevitability). What kind of proof would you require to accept this? The ideal would be for an admin to do a breakdown on where the users were when they downvoted (e.g. /r/all, /r/the_donald new queue (i.e. brigader), /r/the_donald main page as some examples off the top of my head) and post the percentages - would you agree that this would be acceptable ideal evidence? Unfortunately 1) I think it's probably an unrealistic amount of effort to expect, given that it would require log analysis and 2) it seems pretty clear that you don't trust spez enough to believe his analysis anyway. So what do you think would be both realistic to expect and acceptable to the_donald users evidence?",False,False,False,3435,10,1331880808.0,False,False

I'm sure you can guess that I won't believe that without proof :)

Anyways, none of that is actual proof of political censorship by the admins. Even though it's a main sub, /r/news mods aren't the admins and don't have that kind of control over things. (I'm not taking a particular stance on that issue, but I'll say that I don't trust random strangers to curate my news properly and fairly - zing!). 

Changes have been needed for /r/all for a long time, I think we can all agree to that. Regular users don't vote nearly as much as a sub (allegedly) motivated to get things on /r/all does, I'm guessing, and I wouldn't be surprised if t_d was the straw that broke the camel's back as this has happened many times before (although I cannot come up with an instance off the top of my head that has been as loud and long as t_d's occupation of /r/all).

He's not homophobic at all.  He loves gay people, just not in the way *you* deem acceptable.

I sincerely believe that this statement is homophobic.  You are denigrating a gay person for disagreeing with you.  Your privilege is off the charts.

No he doesn't.  He's a narcissist –he loves himself.  You are interpreting his words through your own prejudices.  It's actually very insulting and demeaning.  It shows that you don't see gays as individuals with their own agency.

Examples of Milo/Trump supporters attacking gays?  The Orlando shooter was a Democrat.

> Milo just reflects how the alt-right really feels about homsexuality, and gives them an excuse to be closet (or sometimes very open) bigots.

His success shows that the alt-right has no problem with gays, because they made one their mascot.  They are the exact opposite of bigots.  They truly judge people independent of their sexual orientation.

You're probably right. Trump is not a politician and isn't part of the GOP establishment. Him slipping through is the equivalent of Bernie or Ron Paul slipping through. That's a small part of why people are getting behind him. They are fed up with the status quo. 

> Are we seriously still obsessing over Benghazi? Newsflash, she didn't kill anyone. If you're going to blame the death of an ambassador on the administration or the cabinet..... how many were killed under Bush? At least 40, IIRC.

Clearly American lives don't matter much to you. It should matter. 


> Racist, sexist, liar, and all around asshole who has an unfavorability rating more than any candidate that's ever preceded him, especially among women and the minorities (and yes, I mean the ones legally registered to vote, before you try that argument), two groups he actually needs if he wants to stand a chance. But it's too late for that. Honestly I don't even think he believes half the shit he says, but he's playing this ridiculous character people like Palin and Bachmann did for real because he knows it will get the Republicans to like him. Of course that's not working out so well because now the Conservative members of the House are calling him out, especially after the shit with the Hispanic judge. The American people just don't want him. The RNC doesn't want him. The only ones who want him are the ones who are still buying into his bullshit about how Mexicans and Muslims are apparently the two greatest threats to the entire world. He dodges every question with vague answers à la Romney only more nonsensical. Every time someone says something he doesn't like, he has a little fit. He is a child and not fit to lead a country.

The racism is baseless. The sexism is baseless. He's employed many black people within his company and one at a very high level. A racist wouldn't do that. And she just so happens to be a woman. A sexist wouldn't do that either. So again lies from the left to deceive you, and clearly it has. Do your research. 

> ""If you build a wall, they'll dig tunnels."" And for that matter, what platform, what exactly are his plans? He's bankrupted numerous of his own business to escape debt. You can't do that with a country and expect it to work. He's not a politician. He's not a world leader, nor does he have the experience to be one. He's a businessman, and a failed one at that.

A failed business man? What planet do you live on? The guy is a billionaire who employs thousands of people. 

> What in the holy fuck are you talking about? 36 years ago was 1980. That was eight years of Reagan, four years of H.W. Bush, and eight years of W. Bush following Bill Clinton. Twenty of the last 36 years, we've had a Republican president. What kind of math did they teach you in school?

Ok my bad I actually forgot about Reagan's two terms and forgot about Bush Sr. completely my mistake, so you can tone down the doucheness. 

> Kicking Muslims out of the country will not solve that. As Obama had to say very clearly in a short speech less than a week ago, there are over one and a half billion people of the Islamic faith in the world. The amount that actually have any ties to terrorist organizations is less than 0.01% of that. Oh and look up Ted Kaczynski and Robert Lewis Dear Jr. while I have your attention. Just so you have some examples of terrorists with zero ties to Islam.

What the fuck are you talking about? No one has said to kick Muslims out. Oops, my schiffy94ness slipped out. Allow me to rephrase that. What are you talking about? Trump wants to delay having them come into the country. And why does it even have to be Muslims anyway? Why can it be from other countries, why Muslims? 

> Where have you been the last eight years? I get you might not like Obama for whatever reason, but hello? Resurrection of a dying auto industry? A bounce back from a crippling housing market crash? Two wars, which cost a shitload of money, ended? Unemployment at an all time low? Do any of these ring a bell? Had the past eight years been McCain or someone else with ideas similar to Bush, we'd have no money at all.

There was a rule put in place about the maximum number of default subreddits you can moderate and I think its high time that a limit was placed on the number of non defaults someone can moderate as well, for a start!

I also think modlogs should be made public so moderators can't hide behind cop outs like calling everything racist, biggoted, nazi, holocaust denial or hate speech when asked why so many comments were deleted. 

Additionally, we have elements like modmail muting being abused much more than subreddit stickies ever were.

Because it's subscribers are constantly online spending time and effort to upvote it, not because the majority of reddit actually wants to see the top 3 posts on /r/all be from /r/The_Donald.

Do you actually believe that to be the case?

The redditmetrics proves nothing other than the fact it's growing quickly, but 160,000 subscribers hardly represents a large portion of reddit.

And this IS a problem. The anti-Trump subs are as shitpost centric as the_Donald and I would like to see less of that type of rubbish.

If i recall correctly, weren't people that voiced dissenting views on /r/the_Donald automatically banned by the mods? That was part of the fun game aspect of it, but it also guaranteed that you eliminate a lot of potential downvotes and it help created an echo chamber solely geared towards promoting the worst possible posts.

>Downvotes exist for a reason. If posts keep staying popular and people constantly complain, that's a failure of the user to use the platform.

Sure. You downvote stuff that doesn't contribute. Shitcomments and shitposts ought to be downvoted. However, the whole point of /r/the_Donald was to upvote shit content instead of quality content. The whole sub decided to invert the intended use of the downvote/upvote buttons in an attempt to drown /r/all in shitposts. 

>The point where that admins start engaging is pruning subreddit visibility, it creates an even greater echo chamber. 

I agree that if subs are selected for reduced visibility because of their controversial content, that is a problem. However, the_Donald was nearly content free and was merely an attempt to invert the purposes of the downvote/upvote buttons to piss people off. Pruning a sub that went out of its way to be content free doesn't make reddit any more or less of an echo chamber. the_Donald was completely dominated by stupid image macros overlayed with a single phrase or sentence. Had 50% (or more) of their posts contained reasoned arguments and meaningful content, then it would be a shame to minimize their voice. I am all for having a discussion on immigration, but a rational discussion on any topic is the one thing the_Donald was most opposed to. 

As for other subs that had problems, you will have to specify which ones you are talking about. Some were in trouble because they specifically targeted people (sometimes outside of reddit) to bully and taunt. Some had mods that threatened people and encouraged their sub to engage in that type of behavior.

Awful to your oversensitive mind.  Many gay people use the word constantly and think it's funny.

> Gay people do have agency, you're putting words in my mouth, I never said they didn't.

You implied they didn't by attacking a gay man for having a different opinion than you.  Gay people are individuals who don't have to follow the hive-mind, or some outsider trying to ""protect"" them from words.  It's super condescending.  You're treating gay people like helpless children.

>> Examples of Milo/Trump supporters attacking gays?

> Jokes using the word faggot.

Your problem is you equate friendly jokes with attacks and words with violence.  People who are truly comfortable with others joke around with them.  You are the high-school square showing up to a party you weren't invited to and telling everyone to stop dancing and drinking.

> When you use the term ""faggot"" you're attacking gays, plain and simple.

Nope.  If I call my gay friend a faggot he knows it's with love.

> Some don't mind being called faggot, a majority do.

So let people use their own judgment and morality in their own contexts.  Gay people are not asking you to protect them from allies using humour.  That's your own narcissism.  You're not a saviour.

> Their liberal use of ""faggot"" does not make them the exact opposite of bigots.

You're incapable of seeing the word as anything but homophobic.  You're imagining malicious intent behind friendly words.  People shouldn't have to cater their speech to your naive sensibilities.  You're a hall monitor patrolling the school to bust people using words the principal has banned.  The kids don't appreciate it.

> Most people share my ""up-tight morality"", or as most people call it, basic respect.

It's not basic respect to interrupt a group of consenting adults to tell them what words they can and can't use.  Gay people don't need you to control their behavior for their own good.

> you're contributing to the stigmatization of gay people.

You're speaking for gay people and treating them like children.  That sets back the gay cause much more than any playful ribbing ever could.  Go join a church if you want to police fun and lecture free people about blasphemy.

""No Posts About Subreddit Suggestions or Concerns (Use Modmail Instead).""

If you're concerned about people being banned for disagreement then perhaps you should have made a mod mail detailing why you think that's a bad idea. No mod said The Donald was free speech. I don't even know if a mod said anything about free speech about Orlando. Users likely did, and for Orlando it was the major subreddit for real news about it.

The censorship of actual news (specifically regarding assaults, attacks, or sexual misconduct by muslims) is a serious issue, not only on reddit, but in the mainstream as well. Obviously Germany springs to mind where we know there was a concerted effort to block the info about mass rape and sexual assault being made public. A story about children being assaulted and threatened in Canada was swpt under the rug because the kids bullying the were refugees. Only small time right leaning news sources posted articles or videos on it. A story about a sexual predator in Alberta left out mention of the person's name because he had a name that would be seen as middle eastern, despite the article calling for other people to come forward with info on this person.

This is why people are and should continue to be up in arms about how unacceptable this behavior is. I understand reddit administration has a hard leftist slant.

In other words, it'd be a lot easier to vote partisan/spammy content from those subs up to the top. This would mean that /r/all would be even more obnoxious than it is now to people who either don't use filters, or people who are new to reddit and are browsing /r/all without an account.

Some people would consider subs like /r/christians hateful.  Others /r/atheism.  Why wouldn't they be allowed to block those from their reddit experience?

The subs I had the biggest issue to previously were /r/fatpeoplehate and /r/coontown.  One was banned for doxxing (as it should have been) and the other was banned for being hateful and racist.

I don't believe that /r/coontown should have banned at all as I'm a big fan of the first amendment.  I do, however think it would have been nice to have been able to filter out their crap so that it didn't become an issue in the first place.

Not only can they uniquely track how each upvote button is pushed, they also know how you got to the page it was pushed on. That's readily available information and would be easy to track. They already *do* detect the difference between votes made when a post is brand new (and heavily weight them, hence the stickied post abuse problem) and votes made later when it's on the front page (where they're less weighted and contribute very little).

Accounts active in the past few hours is going to be a tiny percentage. You can see how many users are active on any given subreddit. Divide this by the number of subsribers on the subreddit and you can get an idea of how active that subreddit is.

No, what I said was that I don't frequent the_donald so I don't know about their situation, but there is evidence that SRS has brigaded repeatedly in other subs, which is exactly what the original comment said that you took issue with.

>in recent times

Moving the goalposts. You said people have been complaining about it for years with no evidence, when the reality is that there has been evidence, for years. Additionally, do you honestly believe they stopped doing what they've been doing for years without repercussions? They're still linking directly to comments, while other subs were forced to use screenshots with usernames blacked out. They still refuse to use ""no participation mode"". What exactly has changed over there that makes you think they don't brigade?

>and all the whining about them that happens regularly is unfounded?

People have been complaining that sub since it was created 5 years ago. The page I linked to was 2 years ago, although I'm sure you could find something more recent with some effort, considering that took me roughly 10 seconds to find. So even if they stopped brigading immediately after the page I linked to was posted, and that's a huge if, that's still 3 years of people complaining about it with actual evidence to back it up. Hardly unfounded. 

>Plenty of shadowbans (and still arE) were handed out for things like following links and voting, and definitely every time someone has been doxxed

Where's the evidence of that happening on SRS? And it certainly didn't happen immediately for several doxxing incidents.

For some reason they get a pass on direct links while other subs do not.

A single meme which isn't a white supremacist meme in and of itself. It's a meme regarding refugees and immigration (one of the main talking points of the Trump campaign). The #WhiteGenocide tag was stupid, but that doesn't make The Donald's users white supremacists.

There are roughly 170,000 subscribers to The Donald. Not all are active, but it's much more than the 6,000 or so in AHS and it isn't a default. There's a large number of voluntarily subscribed users.

You can't have both of these.  Either /r/The_Donald is a free speech sanctuary, where silencing racist and xenophobic discussions runs counter to that ideology, or it is a political subreddit which only allows speech in support of its candidate, in which case racist and xenophobic views are part of the candidate's platform and therefore should be included.

How many of those subreddits directly linked to comments? One. And considering that one of those meta subreddits is KiA and would ostensibly be working against the SRS if they were brigading as well, that doesn't mean much.

One account was suspended? Wow. For someone who apparently requires *mountains* of evidence to back up the claim that SRS brigades, you sure aren't backing up your claims with much.

>So uh, if the brigaders are being banned in the cases that it happens what exactly is the problem here?

Are you honestly suggesting that SRS stopped brigading right after that first link I posted, despite a clear 3 year record of brigading by that point, then they decided to lay low and do nothing for two years, then they spontaneously brigaded again, but then everyone involved got banned and now they're not doing it anymore?

Are you saying that all ~80k SRS subscribers have the self control to only upvote posts in the SRS sub itself and not follow the links? Why even link to the comment in the first place if that's not the intention?

Again, for the third time now, it's inherent in the format of the subreddit. For some reason they're allowed to link directly to comments, despite other subs not being allowed to do so.

Well that certainly disproves everything I said. Weird how just a few comments ago you were complaining that actual evidence wasn't any good because it was too old, but now allegedly recognizing a comment from 5 months ago is good enough. Also, SRD requires its users to use non-participation mode, for what it's worth, so again, SRS is the only meta sub that I'm aware of that is allowed to directly link to comments. There's really no defending that. The entire point of the sub is to direct its subscribers to comments that they don't like, and inevitably they downvote.

Remember FPH? They only allowed screenshots with names blacked out, and the mods were surprisingly vigilant about that rule because they knew that the only way a hate sub sticks around is by being a stickler for the rules (see r/coontown). Inevitably, some of their users searched for the comment text on google, found the original comment, and posted hateful shit. Now how exactly was FPH at fault for what its subscribers did outside of the sub, but SRS isn't at fault for what its users do through the sub itself? If it's the hateful content of the comments themselves, then the users should have been banned, but they banned the sub for directing its subscribers to other subs. There's concrete proof of SRS users doing the same exact thing, in an even more direct way, and even worse with multiple doxxing incidents, but there have been no repercussions for the sub. They're not even required to follow the same rules as other subs and use non-participation mode, even though that's admittedly easy to work around.

>additionally, there's probably plenty of users there that got temporarily suspended and are now unbanned because it was their first offense.

Wow, you've really thrown the whole evidence thing right out the window, huh? Let me try. There's plenty of SRS users who weren't banned or temporarily suspended at all, despite clearly breaking reddit's rules in ways that have gotten many other users banned or suspended in the past. That's evidence, right?

>are you saying that a sub that has 200 active users at peak times can meaningfully affect how a sub with 20k active users votes?

When directed at a single comment? Are you fucking serious? Most of the linked comments on SRS have less than 200 upvotes to begin with, so yeah, they have a meaningful effect. A 20 vote swing on a single comment has a meaningful effect on the overwhelming majority of comments on reddit, much less a 50 or 90 point swing as shown in those links.

Because it absolutely does work as intended as evidenced by the weeks they dominated the front-page. All that's happening now is people have become fed up enough with the Trump spam on the front page that a new brigade is just sitting on the subreddit's newqueue, disabling the CSS, and mass downvoting content from /r/The_Donald and mass upvoting content from /r/EnoughTrumpSpam.

Either way, this is the entire point for the second time. 

Small but active groups of redditors shouldn't be able to organize upvote and downvote brigades in attempts to control content on the /r/all queue.

No shit, you don't want us to even notice when we're clicking on an ad.  This is going to lead to interrupted browsing. How can I freely browse posts if now I gotta worry about picking out the ads from the actual content.

 It's going to interrupt the flow of discourse, conversation, and is displacing actual content that would be shown on the front page. It's an ad so it's not like downvoting it will make it fall away from the front page that would defeat the purpose. it could have a bunch of negative votes and just sit there admist actual news and conversation.

Keep your ads up at the top of the page in the blue box and stop praying on your users. That's how you get trust issues.

IMO, this works nicely. Moving the sponsored indicator to between the link & the thumbnail gets the job done cleanly & 'tabs' the link over slightly. This creates a slight distinction between user content & ads in the vertical - works well with scrolling through IMO, it's a small, simple visual cue that stands out while still fitting in with the looks of the site.

TLDR - I think the sponsorship indicator should affect the post in a horizontal way since reddit is browsed vertically.

Edit: Just noticed the bullhorn instead of the number on the left, good touch. I could also see replacing the symbol with 'sponsored' to achieve a similar effect.

- Run a data analytics side business for helping companies understand public perception, because you have some of the strongest, cleanest (at least in the serious subreddits) qualitative data on the internet. 

- Make a new Reddit Silver subscription which is like a 5$ a year for an ad free experience.

- Reddit-as-a-service paid model for any company / group / people who want a private reddit experience where they can set their own rules...with the whole package - unlimited media hosting, some admin analytics tools etc.

- The content curation business aka your newsletter on steroids: Paid weekly online magazine where content that is certified by redditors is published in a readable (Ad-free) format. Users get content based on their interests. Can even think of publishing user's post if permitted, (hi Buzzfeed!) and share some small revenue %.

- Do nothing. Work like Wikipedia. Collect donations (daily reddit gold?) enough to run servers and pay employees.

I think I wouldn't have *too* much of a problem with this approach if all the ads are targeted well enough. For instance I have no problem seeing mouse adverts in the csgo subreddit, or science text book ads in askscience.

SRS is actually an internet cult and they meet most of the criteria needed for being a cult. The way in which they effectively serve as an internet cult is that it is possible for anyone to easily join the cult so long as they have an internet connection and a reddit account and are willing to do exactly what they are told by the SRS moderator hierarchy and the people who control and run the subreddit. The worst thing about Shitredditsays, however, isn't that they have their own shitty subreddit that makes zero sense to the outside world and to those who are sane and don't believe in the views of social justice warriors and radical feminists. The worst thing about SRS is that they and their friends from other like-minded subreddits on reddit - with the cooperation and unspoken support of a few reddit administrators - have managed to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 where a clique of users who are chummy and friendly with each other have managed to take over a very large portion of this website. The users who have turned reddit into Digg 2.0 and who threaten to ruin the site are what I and some others who understand the situation have come to know as and refer to as ""metareddit cancer."" I have taken it upon myself to go ahead and create the subreddit /r/metaredditcancer to act as a watchdog that chronicles everything that this cabal of reddit users are doing to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 and - in particular - to turn the site into a place run by social justice warrior and feminist moderators who tolerate no deviation from their beliefs in the numerous subreddits that they have come to control as moderators. My hope is that after reading this comment of mine that you will subscribe to /r/metaredditcancer so that you can stay well-informed about a very serious situation that has arisen - largely unknown to most users - on this website so that we can all gain a greater understanding of what a powerful cabal of agenda-driven users are doing to and have done to this site that we all love. I am a long-time user on reddit who has intimate and in-depth knowledge of this cabal and who has modded multiple subreddits both large and small, who has been intimately involved in discussion with this cabal of users regarding their control of reddit, who knows what their agenda is and what they want to do with their power and control, who has sat in their private discussions in internet chat rooms, who has seen leaks from their private subreddits, and who has absolutely had enough of what they have done to reddit and of what they will continue to do to this site unless the rest of this site is exposed to who and what they are and what their endgame is. What happened to Digg and what has happened to 4chan very recently is undeniably and positively what is happening to reddit now and what has been happening here since 2012. The cabal of users and moderators who I refer to as ""metareddit cancer"" hail from the subreddits Shitredditsays, circlebroke, Braveryjerk, circlejerk, TheBluePill, SubredditDrama, SRDbroke, and Drama. This cabal of users are - for the most part - the moderators of these subreddits and these users also control many other subreddits with thousands and even hundreds of thousands of subscribers. They mod subreddits like /r/news, /r/politics, /r/worldnews, /r/Subredditdrama, /r/creepyPMs, /r/offmychest, /r/TIFU, /r/explainlikeimfive, /r/changemyview, /r/LGBT, and numerous other subreddits where they have managed to worm their way into moderator positions over the years and then go on to have total control over the type of discussion that goes on in their subreddits. They make sure that any discussion that goes against their social justice and feminist beliefs is censored and controlled and/or they mod their subreddits like ban-happy dictators who get rid of anyone who breaks the circlejerk that goes on in their subreddits every week. This is absolutely the case with offmychest, creepyPMs, and Subredditdrama. Maybe the worst example of their way of worming into moderator positions and destroying subreddits is that of /r/LGBT and how 2 transsexual radfem SRS trolls - one of which has become infamous on reddit and other chan websites - managed to take control of the subreddit in 2012 and then acted like dictators and abused their power so badly that reddit's administrators had to be called into the drama. The admins refused to remove the two SRS moderators, the LGBT subreddit went into meltdown because of them, and this led to the subreddit being ruined and people having to flock to the newly created /r/ainbow subreddit because one of the biggest forums for discussing LGBT issues on the internet was taken over by members of Shitredditsays. This is the first notable time that SRS and other metareddit cancer have taken control of subreddits and they've gone on to manipulate reddit's subreddit request system to bring even more subreddits under their control. They organize subreddit request attempts in private subreddits where they plan out their agenda and they do the same in their internet relay chat rooms as well. I can say with total confidence that there is no other reddit clique and group operating on this website that looks to take over and control as many subreddits as they can in a clear and indisputable attempt to control the flow of conversation so that conversations in any given subreddit always lean and kowtow to radical feminism and a perverted form of social justice. NO OTHER GROUP EXISTS that is looking to take over as much of this site as possible. One of the more troubling things that I have come to understand having been an intimately involved user of reddit for years, is that some of reddit's current and past administrators support and belong to this cabal of metareddit cancer. An administrator who was fired from reddit two years ago immediately was added as a mod of Shitredditsays as soon as he left his admin role and made clear what some users had already known: he was literally a member of Shitredditsays and as an admin he used his power to carry out SRS's agenda. He routinely ostracized and terminated the accounts of (shadowbanned) people who posted in subreddits that SRS want destroyed and now he sits as a moderator of SRS. This is one of the biggest yet unknown bits of corruption in reddit's history yet you wouldn't know it because the subreddit created as a watchdog for this sort of thing - /r/Subredditdrama - was taken over by SRS and reddit metacancer in 2013 and they censor discussion about themselves so that people aren't aware of what is going on. The takeover of SubredditDrama is one of the worst things that has ever happened on this website because of its 150K subscriber size and because the very people who are the problem that I am discussing happen to be in control of SubredditDrama. This is clearly a monumental conflict of interest given that anything nefarious that this group of users do cannot be openly discussed in SubredditDrama without their consent. What caused this cabal to come to be and what is it that unites them in their desire to control the site through moderator power and through cliques? A need for friendship that's lacking in real life. A # of users involved in this cabal are depressed, aren't ""cool"", are LGBT (more difficult to be included socially if you are a member of this group in real life), are social outcasts, or just want to have some internet friends because they spend a lot of time on this site. This last reason differs a bit from the other reasons and is different in that some users - a smaller number - belonging to this cabal get drawn into it without knowing what the agenda is and they simply just want some internet friends. However, they always cave to the agenda when it is brought up (perverted feminism and social justice and tightly-controlled, censorship-happy moderation in the cabal's subreddits) and so it doesn't matter that their intentions for joining the cabal were innocent. In the end, they always come around and you can already see how this is cult-like behavior. Anyone who doesn't toe-the-line and go along with the agenda is shunned or cast out. I've spent time talking to one of them who was cast out of one of the cabal's private subreddits after realizing that the nature of the cabal and ""group of friends"" wasn't innocent and that everything revolved around feminism, social justice, and the ego-driven desire to control as many subs as possible. The scary thing about my interaction with this cast-out former member is that the cabal looks to get your name and personal information. They do this through their everyday IRC chats and in Facebook groups where some choose to take friend requests with their real names. Others use new Facebook profiles with their reddit names. This cast-out user used his real account and he knows now that a reason why they send friend invites is so that you think twice about going against them because then they have your personal info and can come after you with threats at home, work, and anywhere else. What the users in the cabal do to gain entrance is act smug and superior (social justice, feminism, morality policing) to redditors. The cabal acts as their cool kids club that they weren't good enough for in real life. THAT IS HOW AND WHY THEY ARE FRIENDS AND WHAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE ANYONE CAN ACT THIS WAY. A cabal on Digg is what led to the deterioration of the site and is what led to the migration that saw users flood to reddit. I'll be damned if I watch the same type of behavior from a group of a few dozen users continue to move reddit towards becoming Digg 2.0. 4chan has been thrown into a serious mess like this after Moot gave mod positions to authoritarian mods in the last year who now control the site given his recent abdication as site admin. Let's not let this develop further on reddit because there's a point of no return.

I get that you haven't personally bought anything from ads, but please keep in mind that advertising has been [a pretty constant percentage of GDP since 1926](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-03/advertisings-century-of-flat-line-growth), so it's highly likely that a lot of people are buying stuff because of it.",True,False,False,19413,4007,1282347041.0,False,True

The intent is to get users to *see* the ads, but not to trick them into interacting with something they're not interested in. Tricking users into clicking isn't actually going to deliver value to advertisers, so as you pointed out, no one wins in that scenario.

If more users see ads, then more users who are interested in that ad will interact. The current placement makes this less likely.

Of course, all this is just a hypothesis, which is why we're testing it and not just rolling it out. The data we gather from this test will help us make a more informed decision :).",True,False,False,19413,4007,1282347041.0,False,True

I don't mind ads on reddit (gotta pay for servers and Gold apparently isn't cutting it), but I *really* dislike the idea of ""randomizing"" them in with regular links. That would lead me to use AdBlock / uBlock. It feels sketchy, no matter how well differentiated the style is. 

I like the mention of the planned infinite scroll (like RES does now). In that case, I could definitely agree with having the ads placed *regularly* (say, every 25th link) as a clearly-differentiated item (personally, the existing ""sponsored link"" style is *perfect*; don't try and get tricky or fancy with it). In a typical infinite RES session I often scroll past 600-1000 posts. That's 24-40 ad impressions, instead of just one at the top. And to the shock of many, I sometimes click on them if they're interesting! *Especially* if they have a comments section I can peruse for other users' opinions, or visible vote numbers (perhaps disallow downvoting on ads, that way I and other users can see the *positive* interaction instead of how many people just hate ads on principle).

But please please please, don't randomize them. That's underhanded and not cool. Allow me a clearly delineated place to regularly see ads, and I'll tolerate (and sometimes interact with) them.

With respect to your questions around targeting - yes, advertisers are able to target ads via the subreddits that a redditor is viewing or has viewed in the past in addition to other things.

I definitely agree that we wouldn't want to show an ad for a funeral home in /r/SuicideWatch! That would be terrible...

I mean, that's what you're saying.. advertising works because businesses waste money on it, therefore if I have adblock I'm just saving money left and right..? Furthermore, wouldn't this mean that cities which have billboard bans and such have failing economies? I mean, if we're spending a huge percent of GDP on advertising, how can the economy turn without it? :O

Reddit is what it is because, for the most part, users trust that it is real.  Tons of marketers would love direct access to this audience of people who share without reservation or hesitation, but *those people only come here and share in such a way because Reddit has a history of keeping it real*.  Mixing ads in with posts is by definition NOT keeping it real- it's blurring the line between an organically upvoted post and a paid advertisement.  I'm sure that will make you a lot of money, but in doing so you're violating one of the core principles that makes this site genuine.  So I would encourage you to think long and hard about whether that's worth it or whether you're 'killing your golden goose'.  

**There is one exception to this, a situation where I might even welcome an interspersed ad- if the sponsored story is subject to the same rules as any other post.**  That means if a sponsor wants a story interspersed with posts, that post is subject to upvotes and downvotes like any other, and the comment section cannot be disabled.  Now I understand a sponsor will want some kind of guarantee, so you could guarantee a certain number of frontpage impressions.  But the place on the frontpage would have to be subject to voting, and the comments would have to remain open.  

And if you think about this- that would be good for the users also.  There are some advertisers who really connect with Reddit's userbase or the userbase of a particular subreddit, for them this kind of story would provide an easy way to market their wares directly to their target audience and engage more directly without violating any rules against promotion.  And users would like it also- if I can see an ad is full of posts recommending that product, I consider that valuable advice.  

It would of course mean that some advertisers get more engagement and more views for their dollar than others.  But it would mean that GOOD advertisers with GOOD products get more views and engagement, which would if anything make users more likely to not ignore ads (as the reputation would be that the ads are worth looking at).

Seventy-one percent said they noticed the content in the ad, but fully 62 percent didn’t realize they were looking at an ad. Further, the ad that was labeled “Advertisement” was seen the least — by 23 percent of respondents. (Spoiler alert: People ignore ads!) http://digiday.com/publishers/5-charts-show-problem-native-ad-disclosure/ . Overall, only 17 out of 242 subjects -- under 8% -- were able to identify native advertising as a paid marketing message in this experiment. Just 18.3% identified native ads as paid messages in the second experiment. http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/265789/consumers-cant-tell-native-ads-from-editorial-con.html .

if you **truly** dont want to be deceptive (which i doubt), call a spade a fucking spade and write the words **paid ADVERTISEMENT** instead of calling it sponsored, native, brand publisher, paid, promoted, presented etc

The new FTC guidance directs companies to label native ads that potentially could be mistaken for editorial content with terms like “advertisement,” “paid advertisement,” or “sponsored advertising content.”  The FTC specifically criticized labels like “promoted” or “promoted stories,” stating that those terms “are at best ambiguous and potentially could mislead consumers that advertising content is endorsed by a publisher site.”  Furthermore, depending on the context, consumers reasonably may interpret other terms, such as “Presented by [X],” “Brought to You by [X],” “Promoted by [X],” or “Sponsored by [X]” to mean that a sponsoring advertiser funded or “underwrote” but did not create or influence the content.  **they are literally calling out the word ""sponsored"" as deceptive**

Right now, advertisers post ads in random places and they make no sense. You guys need to stop wasting time on ad development, and hire some community people that really understand reddit.

That's actually how most businesses work. They make offers directly to the people they know will buy their product because they know those people need their product. Or at least they can trick them to. But you're not playing a short-term game.

>Hey there. I'm sorry that promoted link didn't fit your subreddit's rules, however in general ads are not vetted for subreddit specific rules. We do check that they pass our [advertising guidelines](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200352595-Advertising-), and we also check that they aren't intentionally instigating in some manner. Otherwise, we wouldn't reject an ad just because it is political or unrelated to a subreddit. We are always open to your feedback, though, so if you have concerns about promoted links in the future feel free to send a message to contact@reddit.com to let us know!

This is not against the sitewide rules or anything, so I don't know what this has to do with the admins (other than some people wanting the admins to step in in such cases - but that's not really a matter of the admins ""not listening"" so much as it's something they haven't chosen to change).

Well, in general, most of these just seem to be questions of ""why isn't this thing the mods did against the rules?"" that the admins have previously answered. They don't reply to every repetitive question asking the same thing they've answered before. (Though it's hard to make a general statement about all ""mod abuse"" questions.)

I don't agree that reddit is anything like the the 5 sites you mentioned as having no problems monetizing. But assuming you're right, let's break down their monetization of each of the sites and compare it to what reddit is trying to do:

* Facebook - they have a bunch of different ad units their ""promoted posts"" on the surface are exactly what reddit is trying to do. But Facebook has an important advantage, their newsfeed algorithm. The NFA minimizes brand and business page content. If a mom and pop wants to guarantee that all their customers who follow them see a post about their annual that store actually has to pay Facebook for visibility. Businesses are second class citizens on Facebook. On Reddit however, a post about a 50% off sale for a niche will rise to the top organically. FOR FREE.

* Snapchat - They essentially invented a new communications medium. Their sponsored stories are nothing like anything else. It's a captive audience in a bubble. 

* Youtube - they're selling TV ads. Unskippable TV ads. Again, different medium, totally different expectations from the audience, etc. Nothing like a reddit sponsored post.

* Pinterest - honestly, I haven't visited the site in a year. no idea what's going on here. 

* Twitter - is twitter actually profitable?

>Bright, in your face ads would be so much worse, and ads at the top of the screen i just skip over anyway, never bother to read them so they just don't work for me as an ad platform.

Like you just said, you skip over what you recognize as ads at the top of the screen which you instantly recognize as ads from where they're placed. The point of this proposed change is that people are choosing to ignore the ads at the top because they're obviously ads, so to ""fix"" it the ads will now be listed in the top 5 ""hot"" content links instead of stickied where you expect them.

I don't really have the time to make a super thoughtful post right now about all the problems i've had with reddit, but rest assured it's small stuff over a long time, not huge singular changes.

For instance the Ellen Pao thing, to me it did feel like she was being set up to take the heat for unpopular change and then tossed aside so the changes could stay but the negativity released.

Another one, which I am still skeptical about entirely believing but the accusation that Reddit (and facebook was included) suppress certain news like the Orlando shooting event. The reason i am skeptical to agree that reddit is suppressing news here is because most reddit users are a hive mind echo chamber of anger a lot of the time. But i do feel like there have been other instances where news (and a lot of times usually meta in-reddit news) gets suppressed.

I guess my advice would really just be to try and put yourself into the shoes of long time loyal redditors.

Votes were already necessarily fuzzed to deceive spam accounts and the like, but they could be used as a rough measuring stick for how controversial a post was.  At the time, there was no real justification from reddit for removing the vote counts, besides that ""it wasn't accurate anyway"".  Although within a reasonable range, it was.   The users reacted overwhelmingly negatively to the voting change, but the admins shrugged and moved on.  Removing that information would - in theory - allow the votes to be more easily manipulated behind the scenes.  The manipulation doesn't even have to be occurring: if the potential is there, users won't be comfortable with it.  Trust is hard to attain on the internet today, and easily lost. 

It may just be me, but it seems that the more the reddit admins try to emphasize transparency, the less transparent the site becomes.  I think the reddit admins have to walk a fine line - as the website's popularity grows, you guys have to be conscious about presenting the website in a good light.  But you have to do it without shaking up the existing communities here too much.  As reddit becomes increasingly curated - hiding votes, banning certain websites and communities (some justified, in my opinion), manipulating the front page algorithm to limit popular posts, advertisements among normal posts - it becomes harder to reconcile today's reddit with the one that blacked out against SOPA in 2011.

The last time I remember reddit declaring their ad revenue they made $8.3 million, of which they were apparently financially solvent enough to disburse 10% to user selected causes.  Just briefly researching I found the following excerpt:

""In 2014, user calculations, which were were called “not terribly off but […] not super close” by then-CEO Yishan Wong, estimated that one server costs $8,280 annually. Accounting for technological increases in server capacity, Reddit could have approximately 400 servers running today at the cost of $3.8 million a year. This, of course, is in addition to the 70 or so employee compensation packages and other fixed expenses the company has.""

So I don't think it's unreasonable to speculate that reddit could be profitable, and that efforts to increase ad revenue are aimed more at increasing profitability than ensuring solvency.

8125,d71fu,d5ii10t,t3_4tmb16,t3_4tmb16,1468954164.0,155,"Benefits: 

-Less low effort memes, the karma whores won't need to bother anymore.

-Good, thought provoking content will be rewarded in places like /r/Askreddit or /r/ELI5

-Less linking awful websites for information that could have just been copy/pasted as a self post.

Negatives:

-Low effort click bait questions will probably take over in places like /r/AskReddit

-Shitposting in subs such as /r/Circlejerk, /r/TheDonald ect will generate the most success. Reddit's top users will be shitposters

-Off season periods in TV show subreddits will be hell on earth. (More so than usual)

-Lying. There's going to be so much bullshit on subs like /r/TIFU. It already happens enough, I can't imagine it with the bonus of Internet pointzzzz. (Although this could make users less naive, and more attentive in seeking out lies)

What made those posts great was that they were good 

Independent of karma.  If a user makes a good post, there is already a gilding system.  

/u/Lumpawarroo made an awesome post because it was an original creative fan theory that nobody had thought of, and had some decent evidence to back it up.  Everybody had a lot of fun with it.

/u/DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI made an awesome post because they had a weird question to pose, and then made everyone laugh when they actually started giving ratings out to the answers

/u/Fuck_Blue_Shells made an awesome post because they genuinely loved grilled cheese and was sick of seeing the subreddit infested with dumb melt casuals.  

I'd like to see how they, and other impactful text-posters, feel about the change.  Because I feel if everyone starts making text-posts about everything just to see what sticks we will see an over-saturation of them, and the good ones will be lost until an inevitable text-repost.

2. Mods are asking for the option to turn off karma on text posts again.

3. Forcing use of text posts is a clunky way of preventing karma from acting as an incentive.

Why not just give mods the option to turn off karma generation in their subreddits entirely?

That way they get what they want *and* people don't have to jump through hoops submitting links embedded in text posts for those subreddits.

(As an added bonus, it would mean apps no longer having to deal with things like inspecting text posts to see if they're really image posts to tell whether to thumbnail them.)",False,False,False,148249,5209,1345878605.0,False,True

I won't deny it, it'd be sweet to get those fictional internet points from text posts. But it shouldn't be that way.

It'll just bring on people who make shitposts and more shitposts.

Hell, I'd jump in too because I sometimes get crazy over ""karma"". They're fictional points but people do a lot to get those points. Self posts were the one thing that was ONLY for the community. Now half of them would be to gain karma.

I won't oppose it if you decide to go down this path(because yay, free points -_- and seriously, many self posts do deserve karma points) but I really hope you'd reconsider. It's to keep Reddit a morally neutral site(yeah, I know Reddit is not neutral on MANY topics but at least there aren't frequent sightings of people spamming shitty jokes and content to get karma).

Reddit text posts always seem genuine to me because I know that they aren't doing it to get attention in the form of karma. Now though... Well, some won't change. Some will take the cheap and easy karma route.

For there is another kind of violence, slower but just as deadly, destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night. This is the violence of institutions; indifference and inaction and slow decay. This is the violence that afflicts the poor, that poisons relations between men because their skin has different colors. This is a slow destruction of a child by hunger, and schools without books and homes without heat in the winter. This is the breaking of a man’s spirit by denying him the chance to stand as a father and as a man among other men. And this too afflicts us all. I have not come here to propose a set of specific remedies nor is there a single set. For a broad and adequate outline we know what must be done. When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies – to be met not with cooperation but with conquest, to be subjugated and mastered. We learn, at the last, to look at our brothers as aliens, men with whom we share a city, but not a community, men bound to us in common dwelling, but not in common effort. We learn to share only a common fear – only a common desire to retreat from each other – only a common impulse to meet disagreement with force. For all this there are no final answers. -JFK ",False,False,False,3,1,1468360531.0,False,False

More recently it's the blatant racism and xenophobia of a certain political figure's subreddit.   And on the other side of the token the abrasively whiny Sanders supporters were probably more infamous.

So there are a few important questions:

1. Will the number of quality posts go up?
2. Will the number of shitty posts go up?
3. Will the signal:noise ratio decrease? (Higher increase of shitty posts compared to the increase of good posts)

I'm unsure of the answer to #1, I think the answer to #2 will almost certainly be yes, and I would guess that the answer to #3 be yes as well.  Overall, it seems like a net negative (less chance for the best text posts to rise to the top, more work for moderators, lower average quality overall).  Those are just my speculations.

Moreover, by providing a (pretty crappy) reward of karma for self posts, it might actually deter some people from putting effort into them that they otherwise might have.  There's been quite a bit of research on the topic.  For [example](http://www.alfiekohn.org/article/risks-rewards/):

>There are several plausible explanations for this puzzling but remarkably consistent finding (At least two dozen studies have shown that people expecting to receive a reward for completing a task (or for doing it successfully) simply do not perform as well as those who expect nothing). The most compelling of these is that rewards cause people to lose interest in whatever they were rewarded for doing. This phenomenon, which has been demonstrated in scores of studies, makes sense given that “motivation” is not a single characteristic that an individual possesses to a greater or lesser degree. Rather, intrinsic motivation (an interest in the task for its own sake) is qualitatively different from extrinsic motivation (in which completion of the task is seen chiefly as a prerequisite for obtaining something else)",False,False,False,24371,2449,1261828307.0,False,True

They are trying to present this as, ""Hey, look, now you can get karma for text posts!  It's an additional reward/incentive for taking the time and effort to generate those awesome self posts that get so much attention!""

But, since reddit is an aggregator, and an aggregator is only as good as its content, they are trying to encourage more people to generate more content.  Why?  There will be a lot of shit, but they don't care about that.  They don't actually have to do any of the moderating themselves.  As long as there are at least a few more of those legendary-status self-posts in all the crap, that means more attention for reddit, which draws users, which means more people to advertise to/buy reddit gold (and to potentially generate content/spread the word to their friends).

Which is good for reddit, becauuuuuse, as per the user agreement:

>You retain the rights to your copyrighted content or information that you submit to reddit (""user content"") except as described below.

>##***By submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.##***

>You agree that you have the right to submit anything you post, and that your user content does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary right of any other party.

>Please take a look at reddit’s privacy policy for an explanation of how we may use or share information submitted by you or collected from you.

(Emphasis mine)

So, yeah.  They are incentivizing more posting because when you self-post they own your shit.

IMO they are downplaying the reason why some of those great posts were generated in the first place: they came from a place of inspiration and effort and not necessarily from a place of greed or attention-seeking.  But now reddit is trying to generate artificial inspiration with karma.

Tsk, tsk.

The karma does have some value, namely letting me know if others felt my post contributed something or even as a gauge of a subreddit being shitty (eg, for when I'm sure that a controversial post was very reasonable and thus was surely downvoted for the idea only). And for others, karma is obviously useful for sorting the posts in an interesting way.

For example, another user posted this below (since deleted) and despite the tone, does bring up valid points (excerpt):

> I'm waiting to see some substantive changes launch that actually improve the experience of reddit. Instead, all we get are privacy-reducing changes to increase the value for the investors, and low-effort changes that basically toggle a setting like karma for self posts.

> It also sucks that, once again, the team at reddit seems to be be out of the loop with the community. Who wanted this? Certainly not the moderators trying to keep quality content in their subreddits.

> Edit: To be less whiny, an example of a feature reddit could implement to actually improve the reddit experience: Allow migration of posts across moderator linked subreddits. Example: /r/AskCulinary tries to limit overly broad questions, which would be a better fit for /r/Cooking. But often they're allowed to live so that the submitter can get an answer, instead of having the post nuked. It should be possible to migrate the post over to /r/Cooking if the moderators of both subreddits had previously agreed to be linked in this manner. That way /r/AskCulinary stays on-topic, and the questioner still gets the chance of having an answer.

> Edit: Also, why can't reddit provide a hack-free, supported (desktop + mobile + api) way to filter a given subreddit. Remove image posts. Show text posts only, etc. Then there are multiple ""communities"" in a single subreddit (e.g those that browse text-post only) instead of duplicating effort and need of discovery against multiple subreddits about a given topic.


The admins really do sound like a broken record at this point. I distinctly remember Pao resigning (and subsequently turning CEO back over to Huffman) this time last year where she he apologized for the bad communication and failure to deliver on promises made. Sounds like a very familiar line being repeated time and time again. 

Further, I think this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4tmb16/karma_for_textposts_aka_selfposts/d5il3y4) is spot on. It really says a lot that reddit is committed in heading in this kind of (murky) direction, and it speaks volumes that they are willing to sacrifice quality of the community to such a degree.

Very sad development with very little (if any) useful benefit for the users. Another change that nobody asked for. What problem does this solve?

Or maybe even allow the subreddit's creator to set it up so the moderators, as a group, or the whole subreddit's user base to vote.

If voting for this change to be in effect for a subreddit is possible and the subreddit's creator goes with the 'subreddit's users vote' option, the redditors that get to vote need to be controlled in some fashion. This could possibly be controlled by some predetermined number of posts in the specific subreddit, total subreddit specific karma, or some minimum post karma ratio for said subreddit. Maybe even add the option for the subreddit's creator set up the option for a vote to occur every so often. I say this as a subreddit's user base can evolve and/or the general thoughts of the subreddit's majority user base flat out changes and a creator may want to acknowledge this or maybe not. 

That being said; users could subvert the total number of posts to vote option if it is not a large enough number post to deter this. They could possibly do this by getting friends or alts to jump into the sub and post single letter comments down through the subreddit's history until they reach the necessary amount of posts to vote.

Of course, low effort memes are even lower effort when it's just a link to the image -- and that always earned karma.

Ultimately, the distinction between self posts not giving karma and link posts giving karma was pretty much arbitrary.  

Really, it sounds like what the base problem really is that some subreddits want to be able to make posts there not grant karma, because they feel that the karma attracts low quality posts.  Seems to me that answer to that is pretty simple -- add a flag to each subreddit where the owner/moderators get to decide if that posts to that sub, of whatever type, grant karma or not.

It has to do with being able to tell how people are actually responding.

If you look at a -100 comment right now, you are going to walk away with the impression that pretty much everyone disagreed with it. In fact, that impression could be seriously misleading.

Further, due to psychology, that people can't see that there is support even though the comment is in the negative makes them far more likely to just dump on a downvote.

The same is true of posts that are in the positive. 

Insofar as determining how the community feels, removing the upvote totals really did damage.

Is it because you missed the shenanigans and low-effort content, and you want them back?

Perhaps. It can become a vicious feedback loop. When low-effort content gets rewarded, eventually low-effort content will be the majority of what gets posted. So it can affect you even if you aren't trying to use a clever sorting algorithm.

> .. what people like the best, and what people like is relatively simple.

I don't really agree. This is a commonly expressed idea. But the logical conclusion of this belief is that we should expect all forms of media to regress to the lowest common denominator. I think that the fact that that doesn't happen - the fact that people work so hard to keep low-effort content off of Reddit, for example, is a testament to the opposite. People actually do crave interesting and substantive stuff. It's just that, when user actions are taken in aggregate, low-effort content tends to win out by sheer volume.

Also, I think that ""high quality"" users are more valuable to sites like Reddit. They are the ones generating the content that is actually unique to the site and that thus distinguishes the site from the otherwise countless (and imminently forgettable) aggregators of low-effort memes.

Not sure how long you have been around, but perhaps you'll recall what a cesspool /r/atheism became a few years back. The mods basically did nothing and the entire sub reverted to memes and circle-jerking self-posts. I could literally scroll down an entire page without finding a single interesting blog post or article. In fact, as an experiment, I tried filtering out imgur content (and a few other image-sharing sites) in RES and was amazed by how much better /r/atheism instantly became.",False,False,False,4091,389,1139423519.0,False,False

It's also so stupid in reddit culture that people even give a fuck if the person entertaining them is telling a true story or not. Movies, TV Shows, novels, commedians, etc make up stories to entertain, and will even claim a fake story is true all the time, and that's just how life works! You enjoy it and move on. But someone on the internet does the same thing in hopes of entertaining you? Burn the heathen, what a lying piece of shit!

As for the Slashdot userID, I actually don't like to reveal it as it makes the search space for my actualy identity uncomfortably small.  But yes, it's low.

Your stealing karma thought reads much like ideas I've been kicking around (along with many others) on [a universal content syndication scheme](https://np.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1uotb3/a_modest_proposal_universal_online_media_payment/), where _who posts or hosts_ content doesn't matter as _the creator_ gets the lion's share of credit or benefit.  While Fake Internet Points aren't a particularly valuable currency, the mechanism behind an accurate accounting and attribution for them goes a long way toward answering the real problems of content reward.

(Though other options, including, say, universal basic income, would also address the fundamental problem of **ensuring content creators can eat**, a point and goal many highly complex schemes seem to overlook.)

So, if a shitposter / reposter gets, say, 1% of the karma reward, and the original poster 99%, there's some fairness.  Skew values as you see fit, but more than a 10-20% ""commission"" to the shitposter strikes me as unnecessary.  Empirical data might be interesting.

Another thought on shitposting:  I've found that [blocking fuckwits is a very effective media s/n improvement policy](https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/drLZV8sm7Tq), and that YouTube itself would be hugely improved if shitposters risked being blocked or banned _en masse_ for riding the coattails of every trending topic with [YouTube Reply Girls](http://www.wnyc.org/story/191458-attack-reply-girls/) or equivalent content.

A wee bit o' seed-of-trust basis to moderation (remember [Advogato](http://www.advogato.org)?) might also make sense.  Not everyone's input matters, and trimming the obvious abusers will make collaborative rating more useful, likely.  [Goodhart's Law applies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), however.

2. Was a multi-kill round for the player in question.  
3. Involved little to no RNG.  
4. Was from an official pro match, not just some Pug or Rank S game caught off of a stream.  

That being said, I present to you some of the best CS plays to date!

Player: Rain  
Context: G2.Kinguin, a team trying to break into the upper echelons of CS teams, is down 4-10 (each map is first to 16 rounds) in the first half of the last map in a best of 3 series against EnVyUs gaming. This game was super important as it was in the semi-finals of a ""Major"". A valve funded tournament with 16 of the best teams in the world competing for the lions share of 250,000 USD. (The majors now have 1,000,000$ prize pools.) This play was important as not only did it demonstrate some monstrous skill and gamesense, it resulted in the half not being nearly as bad for G2, as it is a lot easier to come back from a 5-10 half than it is from an 4-11 half. Sadly, this play did not result in them making an amazing comeback and winning the semis. :(  
Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ss1OQwDuA

Player: KRiMZ  
Context: In the finals of a different major, FNATIC, an insanely skilled team (Thought to be the greatest team in CS:GO of all time) began mounting a comeback against EnVyUs (again ikr), all hope seemed lost as it was only KRiMZ left against 3 players on the nV side, but despite being only a support player, he manages to show off some insane spray control and systematically kill off all 3 players, shattering nV's economy and allowing FNATIC to take begin the comeback and take the game into overtime and win out the map.  
Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7JehDGAkTo

Player: Hiko  
Context: in the quarters of a major, after an insane 3 kills from Dupreeh(on the other team), Hiko, finds himself in a very tough situation, 2 versus 4 players. The bomb had been planted for quite a while and he needed to defend against 4 enemies while his teammate defused the bomb, so for 10 seconds he systematically decimated Dignitas's offense, spinning around and destroying anyone who peeked him. This round shattered the Dignitas economy they had built up and in the next round, Cloud9 (Hiko's team) won the game and moved on into the semi's.

Because it gives insight into how the community actually feels about that content, and people's opinions change depending on how popular they feel a certain opinion is which makes it important to show the actual numbers. The current vote total affects the way people vote, that is a fact. 

If there is a discussion taking place it is useful to know how the community at large feels and not just show that there might be a slight majority that causes it to go in one way or the other.

A -500/400 post has been received in a much different way than -100/0, and that is meaningful insofar as determining the sentiment from the community.

Additionally, on smaller subs or conversations that have a high number of child posts, the controversial tag won't be tripped. i.e. 6 disagree 5 agree would show as -1, which could lead the person who posted it into thinking only two people read the comment and both downvoted. There is no way to tell.


> a -500/400 comment is already highly visible in 'controversial' sort, while -100/0 comments aren't, because they're treated as spam.

That largely only works for top level comments. 

If there is a discussion between two people, and there are lots of people reading, sorting by controversial doesn't give you any additional insight into how people actually feel about that discussion. The most you will get is a controversial tag, and that is really vague and the tag will go on and off.

Sure, that is one approach to moderation: let anybody post anything, and see the site quickly become an unusable, unvisited garbage heap. 

And of course they (or Reddit) don't actually let you post anything you'd like. They still moderate/censor the content. I bet if you tried to post some ISIS propaganda, child porn or drugs for sale your post would not be long for this world, ""uncensored"" or not.
