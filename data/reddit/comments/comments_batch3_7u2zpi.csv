After I enabled 2FA. I was able to disable it whilst being still logged into my account, but without being prompted for a 2FA code or generated backup code. I checked using Incognito mode, logging in cleanly, and I was still able to disable it without requiring a 2FA code.
So before if a co-worker/spouse/friend jumped my computer they already weren't able to change my Reddit password without me having the option of resetting it to my email, but now they can click 2 buttons to enable 2FA and I get locked out of my own account with no method of recourse to get it back. -_- This isn't a good design, especially with a ""log me out from everywhere button"". I don't want to scope creep the project, but that seems like it should be within reasonable security scope/threat model.

But I do understand the trade off, people losing their phones and such. So I would think the solution may be best left up to the user. An SMS notification perhaps, but people's number may change when they lose their phone anyway too. SMS is not secure, but anyone who knows that would be using a seperate option which would be a default unchecked checkbox which says ""I agree that I must provide a 2FA code, or a backup code, to deactivate 2FA OR THIS SETTING""?

Also, having to prompt for a 2FA code to get my backup codes would be good. So someone can't come along and have a list of 10 secret codes to use against me later down the line if they figure out my password/email account details, and at that time they wouldn't need to compromise my phone at the same time.

Pretty UI stuff:

On the Enable Two-Factor setup screen, you have to click ""Enter the key manually"" to get the image back, that text should update.

Secondly. When you login, the button to submit your 2FA code says ""Check code"", I would suggest it should just be ""Submit"". That's a blur of the lines between implementation (which is literally checking the code), and usage(which is someone using it is going to legitimately be just submitting you the code they have).

**DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL THEY HAVE WORKED OUT ALL THE BUGS.**  

Mods support across Reddit is limited, and if you mess up on authenticating, you WILL be locked out of your account.   

At least, that's been my experience with Apple's two-factor verification. I had to tell someone that their brand-new iPad Pro they just bought is now a fancy paperweight because they forgot their authentication credentials. There's no coming back from that, ~~even~~ unless if you have a receipt (this guy threw his away).   

Granted, Reddit isn't a $1300 device, but it would be extremely annoying to be locked out of  your Reddit account until an extremely overworked volunteer mod can verify your credentials, assuming mods have the admin rights to do this. That could be hours, days, hell, even weeks.   

If it's Reddit's tech support only that will have these admin rights, it could be permanent.   

And, frankly, the vast majority of people on Reddit have little to no need for this kind of security, considering that Reddit is basically just a bulletin board full of shitposts and a tiny bit of really usable information.    

It's not like they have access to your financial records.

It's bad enough that you constantly spam, over and over and over again with begging, pleading, and endless demands to use your Android app -- when I use your site on mobile.

Due to that, I use Reddit a LOT less than I would otherwise.  I essentially never use it on my phone.

Don't pester me about this on every connection to Reddit, or login.  Don't bug me about giving you my mobile phone number -- no, you'll never, ever, ever get my phone number.  Not for 2-step, or any other reason.

It's GREAT to give people the option.  Just don't force it.  Because, why would I even remotely care if my account is compromised?  I'd just make another, and move on...

EDITED...

I now see you can use an external two-factor app.  That's a nice touch, and good to see.  I still have little desire for Google or Authy to link my account info to my phone ID.  As far as I'm concerned, that's MORE invasive than my mobile app number.

Not because of Reddit linking account <-> ID, but because Google will surely link my Android phone <-> Reddit account, and likely Authy will too (via all the perms their app has).

i just think there is a lot more wrong with this site that needs fixing first, rather than implementing 2FA for something that holds little to no personal or attributable information about me IRL.

Why not just encourage people to implement a secure password (your recomentdation of 8 characters could be brute forced in anything from 22 mins to 2 hours depending on complexity. 12 characters would be a better recomendation). 2FA is beyond overkill for a site like reddit... 

Speaking as a developer myself, the only reason you would decide to implement this is if you were planning on collecting a lot more personal information like full names and more contact info, maybe storing credit cards etc, stuff people would actually worry about malicious actors gaining access to... If that is the case you need to take a look at what your actual users want otherwise you'll quickly find the number of users starts to drop off, because you are no longer offering the service that we originally came here for. If you're not careful you'll end up giving up your USP for the sake of trying to compete with the big boys of social networking.

Yeah, no thanks. 

Honestly, there is nothing to gain from hacking the average Reddit account so there is no need for 2FA. I'm willing to bet 50% or more of the active accounts on Reddit are throw away accounts, alts and abandoned accounts. 

With all of the censorship on Reddit these days being dished out by over zealous moderators and the severely lop sided politics that rules this site there really is no reason to even have an account on Reddit. What's the point? So you can share, be down voted, deleted, silenced. What made Reddit great was the open discussion and free flow of information. Today? It's nothing more than a news aggregate that wants to serve up ads and is willing to delete, ban and ignore the user base just to appease it's own political, financial  and social agenda. Anyone who doesn't already have a Reddit account is better off just being a voyeur and not engaging. The leadership at Reddit is toxic and so is a majority of it's user base.

Is no one paying attention to the way the world is going?  Pretty soon everything you type out on your keyboard will/can be open for use against you in some form or another.  I am on reddit a lot and even the most sincere person is an asshat and says silly or ignorant things occasionally.

Scenario:  Google gets hacked, emails and passwords are leaked, their authentication app is also hacked, someone puts a file out there with everyone's email/password and log in history (along with posts) of the major websites and forums for the world to see.  It's all easily searched and indexed.

It starts off with someone trying to gotcha a republican but quickly spirals out of control as average users are targeted for speech from 1500 different groups looking for people to hang.

Regarding your phone-in-toilet comment, that is not what 2FA codes are. They are a second factor of authentication whenever the site requires to reestablish your assertion of you saying who you are(typically when logging in). And to hit your second point, even trusted devices should be re-prompted every 30 days for a TOTP code again, by industry standard. The limits the window of opportunity for an already logged in compromised device.

Here is the process that LastPass goes through to remove a 2FA code.
https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=7066

They use another alternative factor of authentication when you don't have access to your TOTP 2FA, your email address. Although it's not asssssss secure as the TOTP, it's a healthier compromise then not required any additional factors to lower your account security.

There should not be a button to reduce account security which avoids confirmation through the already existing account security.

TOTP: 
Secret is created which is shared between server and user. Secret is combined with the time using a hash to generate the OTP. Server and user both generate OTP and compare. What this looks like to the user is an app generates a 6 digit number, which is presented to the server to authenticate.

Weaknesses: Secret can be exposed at time of creation, and can be accidentally exposed by either the server or user. Even if the secret is stored in some write-only fashion like on a yubikey, the app/key can be tricked into giving out OTPs that will be valid in the future by feeding the app/card a time in the future.

U2f: User generates a private-public key pair, usually in some sort of write-only fashion on a usb token (such as a yubikey) so that the private key cannot be compromised without posession of the token.

User publishes the public key with the server, and the server generates a challenge at the time of authentication to verify the user possesses the private key. What this looks like to the user is they plug in the USB token and press a button to authenticate.

Advantages: since no secret is shared, the secret (private key) cannot be exposed; challenges are generated randomly at authentication time, so they cannot be solved ahead of time like TOTP.

I think 2FA should probably not be possible without a verified e-mail address.  If someone loses their 2FA token, then the process for fixing that should be automated but very lengthy.  IE- start the process, get an email that alerts you that someone's trying to disable 2FA.  You will then get another identical email every day for a week at a random time each day, and a popup on each device logged into Reddit.  At the end of the week, the 7th email includes a link to reset 2FA.  
Point of this: if someone's phone gets stolen, the thief might have access to both their Reddit and their email.  A week is enough time to reset passwords etc.  

Some heuristics should be built into this- IE if you are doing it from the same IP as you usually log into Reddit from, it's easier; if you're doing it from another country or from another device it's harder.  

For verification options it might be useful to spread that out.  Let someone link multiple contact options (different emails, twitter, SMS, landline phone, etc) and specify to only turn off 2FA when two of those contact methods approve it.  This should be optional, NOT required- don't want to set up a 'let Reddit doxx you or you don't get security' type situation (and a lot of people WILL see it that way).

TOTP is an example of a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate a one-time password.

FreeOTP is a soft token authenticator that can be used for two-factor authentication. It provides implementations of HOTP and TOTP. Tokens can be added by scanning a QR code or by manually entering in the token configuration. FreeOTP can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator even when logging into Google services. It is maintained by Red Hat under the Apache 2.0 license.

https://gauth.apps.gbraad.nl

You need to enter in the secret key. When you initially set up TOTP on a reddit account, you get the QR code, and clicking some text displays the secret key. So you could store that secret key in some alternate account online, and in an emergency, log in to that account, use the secret key to enroll a new TOTP device (such as this website), and then log into you reddit account. You could do something similar by saving the QR code image, and enrolling a new (camera-containing) device using that QR code in an emergency. With a general purpose QR code reader you can also scan the QR code and extract the secret key from the data, it's pretty clear what the secret key is from the data.

There's also [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) which is a TOTP client for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Chrome extension. It syncs your keys to the cloud. You authenticate into your account via SMS, so it's maybe vulnerable to SMS hijacking just like other SMS 2FA. Although I think it might allow you to encrypt your backups with a password.

Lastpass [also](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/18/lastpass-authenticator-can-now-back-two-factor-data-online/) can store TOTP keys and sync them between devices. I'm pretty sure it encrypts them with a password you choose.

The Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time. It has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238, is the cornerstone of Initiative For Open Authentication (OATH), and is used in a number of two-factor authentication systems.

TOTP is an example of a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate a one-time password.

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

Or look at it this way. Start with what we'd all agree is a bad password. All lowercase, 8 characters long. That's ~2e11 possible passwords. That's well, well within what's trivial to brute force.

If it's an IP in a mobile data range, that's likely to be a single individual (rather than NAT'ed WiFi).

All they then need to do is correlate website or service sign-in (which will be bounced off their services) with either existing cookies or some other identifier (or possible even simply the timing of when it happens) and you have some added confidence to the real identity of a user (and it only takes one slip-up to forever make that link).

Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War.

No, their implication was a service placing a limit should be _considered_ insecure.

Not ""the limit makes it insecure"".

""The limit makes it so you have to assume the service is insecure.""

That advice goes around often. People give that advice because a service that places limits on password length often doesn't hash passwords (because hash functions don't have a practical input length limit).

If this is the first time you hear that advice, then I understand your confusion. But this isn't about length complexity at all.

It's about the same idiots who think password length limits are a good idea also not knowing the first thing about security.

See the top reply to that original post:

> Even then be suspicious. A max password length of any size implies they could be storing the password instead of its hash, a major security blunder.

I’m a clinical psychologist, and for the past six years I’ve been the mod of a subreddit for people with borderline personality disorder (/r/BPD).  BPD has among the highest rates of completed suicide of any psychiatric disorder; approximately 70% of people with BPD will attempt suicide at some point. Given this, out of our 30,000 subscribers, we are likely to be having dozens of users attempting suicide every week. In particular, the users who are most active on our sub are often very symptomatic and desperate, and we very frequently get posts from actively suicidal users.

I’m telling you this because over the years I have felt very unsupported by the Reddit admins in one particular area. As you know, there are unfortunately a lot of very disturbed people on Reddit. Some of these people want to hurt others. As a result, I often encounter users who goad on our suicidal community members to kill themselves. This is a **big** problem. Of course encouraging any suicidal person to kill themselves is a big deal, but people with BPD in particular are prone to impulsivity and are highly susceptible to abusive behavior. This makes them more likely to act on these malicious suggestions.

When I encounter these users, I immediately contact the admins. Although I can ban them and remove their posts, I cannot stop them from sending PMs and creating new accounts to continue encouraging suicide. Instead, I need you guys to step in and take more direct action. The problem I’m having is that it sometimes take more than 4 full days before anything is done by the admins. In the meantime, I see the offending users continue to be active on Reddit and, sometimes, continuing to encourage suicide.

Over the years I’ve asked you guys how we can ensure that these situations are dealt with immediately (or at least more promptly than 4 days later), and I’ve gotten nothing. As a psychologist who works primarily with personality disordered and suicidal patients, I can assure you that someone is going to attempt suicide because of a situation like this, if it hasn’t happened already. We, both myself **and** Reddit, need to figure out a better way to handle this. 

Please tell me what we can do. I’m very eager to work with you guys on this. Thank you.

Edit: Thanks for the support everyone. I’m hopeful that /u/spez will address this.

Edit 2: More than a month has passed and I haven’t heard back from /u/spez. I heard from another admin who was very kind and eager to help, but ultimately they could not come up with a solution and told me that their hands are tied.  On Sunday 3/4, yet another person told one of our users to kill themselves. As of Wednesday 3/7, 72 hours have passed since I first contacted the admins about this and I have still not heard back. I’m really at a loss here.  I fear that it will take a publicized suicide for anything to change, and perhaps not even then. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get Reddit to actually do something about this?

**Edit 3 (5/3/18): It happened again this weekend and I didn't get a response for 48 hours.  The user had not only told people on /r/BPD and other subs to kill themselves, but had also encouraged a mentally unstable person to commit murder.  Two full days and the person kept posting.  Here is the final word that I got from Spez: ""What you should do: report the user, then ban them from your community. We'll always be working to speed our response times, but you have some agency here as well.""  That's it.

You, as the CEO of Reddit, are the person that can benefit most from listening to two people who have built some of the largest online communities. 

> And I think that one of the things that Heather Champ, who is a community manager, the first community manager on Flickr says—one thing she says repeatedly is that what you tolerate is what you are. **So, if you tolerate white supremacists on your platform, you’re a platform for white supremacists.** And you just have to accept that. And that unless you draw the lines, unless you say what is and is not acceptable on your platform, it just becomes a disaster.

 

> Because you want to be part of a community that share your values. And you don’t share values with white supremacists.

I had to rewind to make sure they weren't talking about Reddit, that is how much this platform has become associated with white supremacists. 

You can make all the excuses you want, but the simple fact remains, **Reddit tolerates white supremacists**. 

I would not want to be in your position, banning T_D would create a ton of issues no one could ever be prepared to handle. 

I hope you have come to realize that this is not about freedom of speech, Reddit is not the government, it is not held to the constitution and the first amendment. It is a platform.  It is up to you, as the CEO to determine what Reddit is a platform for. If you banned T_D and related white supremacist subreddits, you would be making a statement that white supremacy is not tolerated. *Even when disguised as a voice for the disenfranchised.* 

You can send a clear message to the people who feel T_D gives them a voice. **You have a voice, but if you use it for white supremacy, we will not force others to hear it.**

You are a public figure now, your actions define you. As long as your action is to allow T_D to exist, you and Reddit will be defined by their tolerance for white supremacy.

Reddit has weathered many controversies, jailbait, the fappening, etc. It is just a matter of time because T_D becomes the next mainstream controversy, and at that point you will have no excuse. The true nature of the subreddit will be evident. Your response about 'cooperative mods', 'a voice for those that need it' will not be accepted. 

At best, you will be seen as someone who did not want to deal with the fallout, at worst, a white supremacist.

If the new profiles can't be improved (ie to easily see a users recent posts+comments with reports and highlights like legacy) then there should really be a way to always default to legacy until a solution is found.

I like my privacy, and I don’t care about the community. I don’t care about downvoting or upvoting. I don’t care about karma.

I create new accounts **all the time** whenever I feel like I’ve posted enough with one account that contains too much identifying information. I literally have multiple accounts that I use to post on different communities, just to avoid being linked together as one user. I even vary my speech patterns: in some accounts I type like I normally would, like here. In others, I purposefully change my “accent” if you will, in order to further obfuscate my identity. Sometimes I even lie about some things like where I am from, or what I do for work, etc, things that aren’t important but things that I think will help obfuscate and misdirect.

None of this is for malicious reasons. I just simply see no value in having one central user account with **all** my identifying information right there. I don’t want a friend to be able to click on my profile and see everything I have ever commented on, every community I have ever participated in, etc.

None of this takes any effort from me. My iPhone just suggests new passwords though more often than not I just just “abcef” as my password, though I don’t believe that’s what I used for this particular account. This is how much I don’t care about karma or the community: that I literally might have just told you my password and it doesn’t matter because at most you’ll just get some porn reddits.

Anyway, this creates a sort of problem for me because while I don’t care about community, as in I don’t care about being a “reddit user,” I do care about helping people, and sometimes I have questions myself. It is very frustrating to make a post on a gaming reddit to ask a question (after I have searched), only to find out a have been “shadowbanned.” I actually didn’t even know what this meant until last year I think. It is also frustrating to make a post and come back in the morning to find out it has been deleted, for vague things like “violating rules” (what rules) or “user too new.”



But anyway none of this matters anymore because now I see that you are a supporter of nazis, by your response about the td question.

Reddit has thrived on simplicity. I've heard countless users say that the website favors form over function, and that's a good thing. It makes Reddit about the content, not about the site.

Reddit has become one of the most used websites because of its content and its simplicity. If you change that, you're not going to steal Facebook's spot. Most Reddit users I know hate Facebook, and their worst nightmare is for Reddit to become Facebook. Unfortunately for them,  that dream is about to become a reality with the way you are taking things.

Many Reddit users have been unhappy with recent changes, including the Reddit app and mobile site. The Reddit app received a 1 star review from me because it is slow, glitchy, confusing, and feature sparse. IIRC, it still doesn't support multireddits. How come your app doesn't support multireddits when my third party app has supported then since day one?

I don't use the desktop site often, but every time I do, it seems there has been a new feature added that I dislike. Many users, including myself, don't like the new profile pages. In addition, I have seen a beta tested feature where you have to log in to view posts. **DO NOT EVER ADD THIS!!!** Reddit is good because it is anonymous. So many users do not log in so that they can view something anonymously or without logging into their account. Reddit thrives on anonymity. Don't take it away.

As a PHP developer, if Reddit becomes Facebook, I will find a team of Redditors to work with me and create a better alternative to Reddit and Voat.

Clinical trials will begin in Congenitally Blind medical rats with  an  EEG monitoring their visual cortex to discover if after administering various doses of this experimental medication there are signs of activity. 

This could potentially cause someone whose been blind their entire life to experience vision. Most people have yet to ponder or even considered the implications that when born blind you experience total darkness: no dreams with vision, no imagination to picture objects; complete and total darkness indefinitely. 

To accomplish this goal we will need funding: approximately $250,000 - $1,000,000 to begin obtaining the appropriate authorization from both the FDA and DEA and to acquire necessary waivers needed to acquire the drug legally. After we get the approval from all of the necessary regulatory agencies, we will begin phase 1 clinical trials in which the aforementioned rodents will be observed. All information discovered throughout this research will be available for the public and published on our company's website. 

If you come across this post and can donate please do, however if you do not wish to participate in this research there are many other ways to help. For example our company is in no way affiliated with the app 'Be My Eyes' on the Google Playstore, but it's so simple to download for free and potentially help someone less fortunate. 

Thank you for your time, support and consideration.

Bots can track new submitters and auto-remove them (you could even have Automod PM them, if it overrides the 'trusted user' thing now that it's admin-sanctioned). Once a user has affirmed that they have ""trusted PMs"" set they can post in your sub.


It's not a true fix as users could lie about their setting or be dissuaded from posting entirely... but the admins historically have a terrible track record getting real solutions implemented in niche cases like this, so it might be all you can do. /r/RequestABot might be able to help.



If you're worried about dissuading users the only other way to do it would be to let them post to a sub where their stuff's removed and have a bunch of approved users as mods without perms - they'd still be able to view the posts.

https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa

This is not about censoring people with opposing views. Don't buy into that false narrative. This is about applying the rules equally across the board. For whatever reason, the_donald is treated with a different standard than other subs and people are fully aware of it. The only ones turning a blind eye to these blatant violations are the admins themselves.

Edit: Here is part of u/spez response to this:

>Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

>We are on the eve of the President’s SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we’re more divided than ever. I don’t believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. 

Read u/spez full response [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/z/dth6eq9)

After reading that, please consider the following:

- several special rules had the be designed by the admins to avoid banning the_donald altogether.

- by u/spez own account, some of the mods have refused to cooperate. Instead of banning them, they simply removed the mods. Why the special treatment?

- the algorithm for /r/all had to be modified several times to avoid t_d spam. Remember how often the people ""without a voice"" would be on the front page throughout 2016? This again shows special treatment.

- In this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx) from 3 months ago, u/spez makes the case that there have been no violations reported to them. This directly contradicts his statement about mods being removed due to lack of cooperation.

- ""*sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we’re more divided than ever.* **I don’t believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse.**"" For a glimpse of the viewpoints that u/spez is defending, refer back to the list I linked [above](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa).

https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa

This is not about censoring people with opposing views. Don't buy into that false narrative. This is about applying the rules equally across the board. For whatever reason, the_donald is treated with a different standard than other subs and people are fully aware of it. The only ones turning a blind eye to these blatant violations are the admins themselves.

Edit: Here is part of u/spez response to this:

>Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

>We are on the eve of the President’s SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we’re more divided than ever. I don’t believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. 

Read u/spez full response [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/z/dth6eq9)

After reading that, please consider the following:

- several special rules had the be designed by the admins to avoid banning the_donald altogether.

- by u/spez own account, some of the mods have refused to cooperate. Instead of banning them, they simply removed the mods. Why the special treatment?

- the algorithm for /r/all had to be modified several times to avoid t_d spam. Remember how often the people ""without a voice"" would be on the front page throughout 2016? This again shows special treatment.

- In this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx) from 3 months ago, u/spez makes the case that there have been no violations reported to them. This directly contradicts his statement about mods being removed due to lack of cooperation.

- ""*sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we’re more divided than ever.* **I don’t believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse.**"" For a glimpse of the viewpoints that u/spez is defending, refer back to the list I linked [above](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa).

You talked about all that testing and surveying, and then you talked about how you'll explain what you'e going to do.

Your ""explaining"" that you plan to do sounds to me more like ""patronizing"".

You didn't talk about  *listening* to the feedback, *integrating* it into the project and *adjusting* your plans based on the feedback. It sounds like you're going to do what you're going to to do *regardless* of the feedback.

How do we know that you care about our feedback and act on it? You said ""the feedback has been super valuable"", but that sounds to me like you're paying empty lip service to us.

This is very similar to the responses that I’ve been getting from you guys over the years.  It reinforces my belief that you don’t fully understand the problem I’m dealing with.  Please let me try to explain it better.

The problem I’m dealing with isn’t my suicidal users; it’s the users who are egging on my suicidal users. It’s the guy who tells the 17-year-old who has been cutting herself all night and who has a bottle of meds she’s ready to take “Do it you ugly bitch, it was your fault you got raped and no one wants you here anymore.”  *That* guy is my problem, and I don’t have the tools I need to deal with him.  Only you do.

/r/suicidewatch is a great place and I’ve worked with them in the past, but they aren’t able to intervene directly and remove abusive users from the website. Only you guys can do that. I’m curious to hear about the ways that you’ve worked closely with them in the past, as you said, because I’ve been begging for that kind of interaction with you and I’ve been brushed aside. Instead of sending me to ask them how you helped them, could you please speak with me directly to generate some real solutions?

In regard to your other suggestions: preventive measures don’t work in this situation. The significant majority of people who come to /r/BPD to post “goodbye” messages are new users or people who haven’t visited the sub before. They’re not people whom I can speak to in advance about setting up whitelisting, and most of these threats happen in comments anyway.  What makes this problem so devastating is that it occurs over the course of seconds or minutes, not hours or days.  By the time even I get involved, the damage is done and the messages have been sent.  What I need is a way to stop these abusive users once they’ve started and to prevent them from doing it in the future.

I feel the need to be a little more firm in regard to your “less than ideal” statement. It’s not less than ideal; it’s extremely problematic and dangerous. Just last week it took 4 days for you guys to take action in one of these situations. The abusive user continued posting the whole time, and he very well could have kept encouraging people to kill themselves on each of those days.  I’ve been hearing “we’re hiring more people” since Obama was in his first term, but it’s still taking 4 days. This is **not** ok. 

Is it unreasonable to ask that a more direct connection be established between the admins and mods of high risk subreddits like /r/BPD? If it is, then what else can you offer me? I’m a user of your site and a volunteer community leader.  I need you to provide me with the resources that I need to moderate your communities and keep vulnerable users safe. Please help me accomplish this.

At any point in a given day, I would bet that one of the front page posts has been manipulated to get to the top. 

What is the general opinion about the massive and blatant Astroturfing that has been going on since the 2016 election?  Is it on anyone's radar?  Is it an acknowledged problem?  Is it working as intended?

Reddit is a very powerful platform.  It reaches millions of people every day.  I feel it's your (reddit staff collectively) responsibility to maintain the integrity of the site and platform, and to put it bluntly, that integrity is swiftly slipping away.  For those of us concerned, rational citizens, do you have a show of good faith that this is something that is being discussed internally at the very least?

That's a non issue, you seem out of the loop. Spez already removed T_D from the frontpage, so I could care less what their circlejerk sub wants to post in terms of filtering my personal content.

The point is that it does not keep *them* from going out and spreading their cancer to other subs. The other point is being associated with a community that harbors white nationalists.

No, reddit comes up often in Google searches and always contains some useful, relevant information. ""Dystopian Craigslist""?

Reddit () is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called ""subreddits"", which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, video games, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough votes, ultimately on the site's front page.

***

**Twitter**

Twitter () is an online news and social networking service where users post and interact with messages, known as ""tweets."" These messages were originally restricted to 140 characters, but on November 7, 2017, the limit was doubled to 280 characters for all languages except Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Registered users can post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, Short Message Service (SMS) or mobile device application software (""app""). Twitter, Inc.

---
The following subreddit is abusing the CSS system and generally 'breaking reddit'

[subreddit link]

Here are photos from a full screen browser on a standard 1080p monitor, so assets have not been scaled to odd proportions: [image link]   

The CSS is using a .png cutout but the borders of their makeshift subscribe ""button"" extend way beyond the cutout edges. In the first picture the default report box covers the ""Other issues"" box which prevents people from reporting trademark and copyright violations to reddit. Reddit takes intellectual property concerns seriously and this community is blocking that ability. [Users can still make a report but it's buried in the links at the reddit footer]. It also blocks the link to Reddit's content policy. The second picture blocks the link to the content policy as well as three subreddit rules. Moderators can't perform their duties if users can't properly report posts.

In addition to the over the top subscribe button the unsubscribe button on the side bar is incredibly small and designed to be more discreet than the reddit default. [Overall and underhanded tactic, see below]

This CSS is in direct violation of reddit CSS rules: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/subreddit_appearance

The massive, invisible subscribe field click-jacks users attempting to interact with the report feature or that want to click something in that section of the page. It [meaning the CSS] effectively obstructs/hides the unsubscribe option just short of removing it.

Furthermore, the CSS rules forbid actions to ""maliciously deceive users"".

Reddit admins have admitted that astro-turfing is a problem on reddit and they are trying to fight against it just like any other large website: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6yrr9/?context=10000

The above subreddit has had systematic problems with vote manipulation and has been consistently demonstrated to be dedicated astro-turfing territory [plus brigading]. Both of which appear to be encouraged and fed by that community. Most users that get duped into subscribing will either find the unsubscribe button or manage it through a user settings page [also not that easy to find, especially to new users], but a few users (especially users new to the site) may not and will be stuck with that content in the subscription feed. It is a low effort 'shotgun' method hoping that some of it will stick. Given the demonstrable history it is not hard to conclude that this overstep of CSS is a shallow, thinly veiled attempt to extend their content. [and by extension their vitriolic goals]   

---   
They also tried this on a spinoff subreddit of theirs I linked in a followup message.

In this thread Spez talks about their ""anti-evil team"" and efforts to end spam, vote manipulation, and general dick-bagery but they seem to be giving a pass instead of growing spines.

But my point is that both sides use phrases like ""false ideas"" and ""influence the public discourse"" to try to justify banning *each other*, which merely leads to a cessation of actual discourse, and further radicalization.

It would be nice to have a definition that both sides can agree upon, that doesn't involve things like ""says things I don't like"" and ""doesn't agree with X ideology"".

Is this an example of a tolerant society not tolerating intolerance and claiming the right to suppress them by force, since the students beliefs were incompatible with the prevailing ideology of the nation-state?

or is it an example of an intolerant society not just not tolerating unlimited tolerance but not tolerating much less tolerance (but impossible to quantify) than Popper would like?  What I mean is, (according to Popper) who defines how much tolerating the state has to tolerate?  me?  you? all of us? the state, itself?

Could Deng Xiaoping have quoted Popper here to justify the quelling of the protests?  I mean so many of the qualifiers for when force is justified to silence your opposition are subjective.  I dont know if he did or not, but if I were him, I would have.

*edit* you dont have to downvote... just answer the fucking question....does Popper explicitly state who defines the level of tolerance or intolerance?  If he doesnt, then who the fuck is the one that does it?  He is saying there are some things a tolerant society cant tolerate, and he is justifying force.  Well newsflash, thats exactly the fucking stance Xiaoping took.  So whats the criteria?  fuck it Ill just buy the book, you shitwits wont know

And dont give me this ""its ok if good societies do it"" and only bad when ""bad societies"" do it bullshit.  fucks sake, every society always considers itself ""good"".  All of them.

A general reddit search involves searching every comment of every post and looking for related key words or phrases. And then doing that every single time one of said millions of users performs such a search.

Searching the specific comment history of a single user, by comparison, is trivial.  All the comments are already separated out into a database.  You're not searching tens of thousands of posts each with thousands of comments.  You're searching a few thousand comments, already partitioned aside in the database.

When I have reddit display 1000 comments on my page and then I do ctrl+f ""relevant key word"" and two dozen instances of that keyword light up instantly - that's all that's being asked for here.

Except instead of searching a thread, with 1000 of everybody's comments, it would just be a page with 1000 or two of my own.  That's going to present a more or less identical load to the servers as just loading a random thread I click on.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the global domination, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the free world that a large part of the population felt unoppressed.

We are on the eve of the Glorius Leaders State of the Regime adress and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we’re more divided than ever. I don’t believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. It’s much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs.

Most subs use their voice in the greater Reddit community to contribute something of value that we as a collective can appreciate and hince we add those communities as defaults or recognize them in some way annually.

T_D is a circle jerk of hatred and they hate the Reddit majority. So why would I promote/grant a voice to a group that hates the community it has burrowed into like a parasite? And why is taking away a single sub perceived as ""deprive(ing) others of a voice""? If T_D wants a voice they can easily head on over to the Drudge Report or Breitfart where they can sling their bullshit with a truly cohesive and like minded culture as opposed to being siloed on this little island/safe space surrounded by the very people they despise and propose killing *numerous*, *NUMEROUS* times. Hell, go to groundzeros, go fcking nuts, there is no shortage of white nationalists havens right now and I see no reason why Reddit should accommodate **one** if we are banning the rest.

For this same reason I have no issue silencing Westboro etc. Are they entitled to free speech? Sure. But the entire religious community in America wishes they would all fuck off and die. By their own admittance their knee-jerk tactics create solvency/revenue, its like a brand based on being a dick, much like Arya Mosallah if you are current on YouTube drama, his brand is merely being a jackass. 

Now obviously from T_D or Arya's perspective they are not in the wrong. And from my perspective I am not suggesting any of this in isolation, otherwise I would have long sense resigned my views.

Generally users don't care a lot about your site and just want to consume some content. They don't want to learn to use an interface, they want it to work based on their experiences with other sites.

It's also why on Android and iOS all successful apps follow the same usability patterns. I've seen how replacing a ""custom"" interface action with a ""standard"" one can boost engagement a lot, and there's a ton of research into it.

There's of course a small subset of users who are experienced enough that they'll make use of almost all interfaces whatever the case, but that's such an incredible minority that you just can't build a site like Reddit around them.

Verifying sockpuppets is not that simple, and just going by IP block is awful and we don't even do that (also, who still uses the 30 years-dead classful subnetting anymore?)

As others mentioned there's various issues with that.  Most cell networks have large regions all operating on a few shared IPs.  We have various methods of sockpuppet detection and mitigation, and it's still not remotely as easy as you make it out to be.

Some of our measures include:

1) Direct IP match - the obvious one. -  Not as useful when it's a mobile network.

2) Disallowing registration via VPN or proxy.  - We have the detection on this working pretty well.  Usually dumps the registration request into manual approval queue, unless it's from really egregious known spam or blacklisted IP, where it gets auto-rejected.

3) Email address similarity.  Some people are really dumb.  Their banned account might have used idiot@livetroll.com, and they come back and register with idiot2@livetroll.com.  Creative.

4) Device identification.  - This one is the most useful.  We've got it setup for both registration, and any time an account logs in, we will get a notice if the account was logged into a specific device that also logged into another account.  At registration it dumps to manual approval queue.

5) The human element - writing style and behavioral recognition.  If they subvert all direct technical means, but their intent is to still get in passed a ban and post whatever bullshit they were, then they always eventually give themselves up simply by writing the way they write.  There's more obvious things, too.  Like showing up to support their own position.  Oh gee, this account signed up just today and resumed the banned guy's talking ""points?""

After all that (and some others I left out or forgot) we still get tons of false positives that end up being family/roommates/friends.  In fact, *most* sock detection hits are this.  There are more legitimate users coming from even the *same device* than actual sockpuppeterrs.  Looking for a /16 block will just implicate dozens of users who have never even met, especially if it hits a mobile network.

So why is this sub not banned but /r/blackcrimematters which had a tenth of its subscribers and much less active was?

The answer is pretty clear that they just want to find a couple obscure spaces to ban to make an appearance of action without anything substantial actually happening.

I want an actual policy by reddit that subreddits are held too and I want white supremacy removed from reddit.

With that said, I've always been against calling out individuals in that way and I think it is a sad way to things.

If I ran a sub I probably would delete things like that and only ban the poster if they continued to post similar things after having been warned.

But even with that I would only delete it because I find it distasteful, not because it is wrong. So I can easily understand why a mod wouldn't delete it and respect them for that decision.

>The 66-year-old Illinois man who opened fire early Wednesday on members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game had raged against President Trump and once singled out House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was wounded in the attack.

>[...] he cited the MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show as one of his favorite television programs, adding that a recent show had highlighted the contributions of 17 wealthy donors to the Republican Party.

>""These men are trying to buy our country,'' he wrote. ""You know they expect something for all this money. That something is that (then-GOP presidential candidate) Mitt Romney and a Republican Congress won't raise their taxes.''

>Hodgkinson appeared to express his most extreme political views on Facebook, where he took particular aim at Trump and the president's family.

>Donald Johnson of Ann Arbor, Mich., said he became Facebook friends with the suspect last February.

>“I was friending a lot of Bernie supporters at the time,” he said. He never met Hodgkinson in person, he said, but they exchanged memes over Facebook.

>“We never even messaged,” he said, “but he liked a lot of my posts.” “He seemed kind of extreme,” said Johnson of Hodgkinson’s Facebook posts, referring to him as a  “Bernie-bot.”

>Johnson said he has been scrolling through his wall since learning that Hodgkinson had been identified as the shooter, wondering if any of his posts may have negatively affected the gunman’s behavior. Johnson recalled posting something in January about the on-camera slugging of white nationalist Richard Spencer, intimating he understood why someone would resort to such an attack.

>“If [Hodgkinson] was reading that, he could have taken that as a go-ahead, I suppose,” he said.

>But Johnson said he has ""never advocated for violence.'' ""I think violence is wrong,'' he said.

I remember back when AlienBlue was the app that everybody and their dog used. And Reddit actually ended up buying AlienBlue as a result... But then AlienBlue slowly morphed into a bug-infested mess. It seemed like with every single update, a new bug was introduced. It got to the point that you basically had to manually refresh your login every time you opened the app, and crashes were fairly common.

And I know for a fact that this wasn’t due to OS updates or phone updates - The old version of AlienBlue is still available for the users who had purchased it... And it works very well, even on the most recent iOS update. It hasn’t been updated in *years*, but still somehow works better than before it was bought by Reddit.

And just as people started switching to new apps, (because they were tired of what AlienBlue had become,) the site went “wait! We’ve got an awesome *new* app! An **official** Reddit app! Use that one!” But then it had less features than even basic basement-coded apps. Don’t get me wrong; I’m all for open beta testing... But the official app release felt more like an *early* alpha, at best. So why has the site continued to push a basically half-finished app down users’ throats? 

I know the app has more features now than when it launched... But why even have the launch to begin with? Why force users to switch? I know I’m touching on some /r/Conspiracy territory here, but it seriously feels like AlienBlue was intentionally filled with bugs, in order to make the official app seem nice when it launched. But again, why bother? Reddit *already* owned AlienBlue by that point. Why not just make that app the best that it could be, and make it the official app?

Like I said, I have no concrete evidence, but in my non-expert opinion I believe that the default subreddits are ""gamed"" more frequently than otherwise.  But again, lack of evidence, so this is really nothing more than my personal opinion and can pretty much be disregarded.

>Whatever you believe in, people are astroturfing in benefit of your cause, too. And, people are gaming as frequently for ""the other side."" It goes both ways. If this is a Trump thing...

It's definitely not a trump thing.  No one is astroturfing in benefit of my cause, because my cause is to end the rampant corruption that has taken absolute control of our political system.  And I agree with you completely.  It goes both ways.  /r/politics has always had an extremely liberal bias, but around the same time that a certain PAC known for it's online social media presence received a significant budget increase it suddenly changed from a liberal bias to a Democrat bias.

To anyone outside the US, both Democrats and Republicans are what they would consider political ""right wing"" politicians. In /r/politics apparently the current US Democrats are the epitome of progressives and we should be thankful to have any of them because ""they are pulling everyone more left than we have ever been historically."" While true, it *kind of misses the point*.

It matters because reddit is a powerful platform to sway public opinion, as was clearly seen in the 2016 election.  It matters because AstroTurfing is an easy way to convince the hive mind that the most important thing to do now is Red shirt vs Blue shirt saber rattling.  ""It's the GOP's fault!"" ""Lul! Salty libs.""

To ignore the possibility of abuse when a platform with as much reach as reddit can be so easily manipulated is simply naive. 

>The reason he won't respond is because you're caught up in some partisan vendetta and don't realize it's fucking irrelevant.

I knew he wouldn't respond because reddit doesn't want to touch this topic.

No I disagree strongly - there's money to be made manipulating reddit but that's detrimental to reddit's bottom line.

If they make a new account to get around a ban and keep posting in the sub, that's obviously ban evasion.  It seems like your ideal ruleset is that bans are only to be used to stop one account (which takes a second to make) from posting in your sub.

The idea comes from common sense. And you litteraly just repeated part of what I said without bothering to read the rest or the other comments in the list of context.

>
>You can contact the mod team after a ban by replying to the mod message.  Every day I see several people do that in my modmail.  Why is someone making a new account to do so?  


Because, if you refer to the original complaint it was about being banned and muted and stopped from being able to communicate and discuss the ban. 

Just because you don't ban and instantly mute doesn't mean it isn't a well known problem. 

>
>Also, do you know a specific person that the admins have taken action against simply because the user made a new account and contacted the mod team once via modmail after being banned?  Also, can you tell me why that person made a new account, since they didn't need to?

That's literally impossible to know unless someone speaks up and tells thier story.

You should look at all of the controversy that happened over subs like fatpeoplehate and coontown 2 years ago in July? They are consistently giving users the reasoning behind censorship and banning - on a site like this, the issue is where do we draw the line? I think there *should* be less space for this anti-social reform. But that's also not the society we currently live in. What is okay and what is not okay to talk about is a pretty grey issue and grey area. I agree that some moderation of this conversation needs to happen, but trying to find a clear cut level of moderation is an incredibly difficult issue to approach in a way that everyone will find fair (and by everyone, I don't just mean you vs white supremacy groups - I mean you vs. me vs. random-reddit-user-348982). 

They do ban and have banned some large and active communities - the larger the community gets, sometimes the harder it is to say for certain that there's one single problematic ideology or problematic action taking place. At what point is a news article about ""3/4 hate groups in Poland are black"" (to pull an example from that uncensored news site) change from neutral to polarized rhetoric to radicalized to radicalized hate, and where does the line get drawn? And at what point do you as a web aggregate of information, founded on complete lack of censorship say ""this is what we can and will censor""? 

The answer to all of this is - it's a pretty tough line to walk. If it seems like there's a possibility that general social morality is being thrown under the bus for the sake of $$, that's worth mentioning - but I don't think reddit is to that point - they've done a lot to start to include some measured censorship and banning despite users not wanting them to.

Many sites implement such technologies and they are very effective. You can give the mods of a subreddit the option to block users who do this. You can also give mods the ability to IP ban users from their subreddit.

You can have the option to mask usernames of community members from others so that they can't PM them when they see User X post a thread about contemplating suicide. Perhaps have an option where the mods can verify users and only those users can see the real usernames.

As for the mods abusing their power, mods of such subreddits could have their real identity verified by Reddit, and all of their actions logged with reasons for said temp ban. Logs are reviewed by Reddit employees. Scripts can alert Reddit if the mod is banning a lot of members and what not. You can have said mod sign a contract with Reddit where Reddit can pursue legal action if said mod is found to be abusing their power.

I know some people wouldn't like this idea, but you can track and block people via cookies.

You can create another permission level that is below full admin, of course, where they receive some of the permissions as stated above.

The_Donald, on the other hand, does not do these things.  Instead of articles, *screenshots* of headlines are used, making people do extra work if they want to see what the article actually says, and whether or not it contains any truth or sources.  Often, articles screenshotted have not only editorialized and misleading post titles, but the articles being screenshotted (which is almost always limited to the headline, so that even the initial text is not visible) refute the T_D post title within themselves.  

For example, a recent poster complained, with a screenshot of a headline, that Andrew Cuomo wanted to give free college to illegal immigrants, and *not* to American citizens.  This was upvoted to the top, with people echoing the sentiment of the post title, and complaining about how treasonous this was. 

I found the screenshotted article, and the VERY FIRST sentence disproved the title - Cuomo *already* provides American citizens living in New York access to free college, and simply wanted to extend this opportunity to ( a small number) of others, who were eligible for DACA.  

I asked the poster about this, and since then, their account has been deleted.  

This is par for the course on The_Donald; sources are purposefully obscured, opposition positions are misrepresented, and people are proclaimed guilty without a single shred of evidence beyond an assertion by a Pro-Trump mouthpiece like Breitbart, ZeroHedge, or Tom Fitton's dedicated obstruction organization, or a tweet from a known far-right (or sometimes, even neo-nazi) personality.  Hell, one of the most common post types is a picture of someone deemed an enemy of The_Donald, with ""Hi, my name is [insert name of chosen enemy], and I [total bullshit about what that person supposedly did without a shred of supporting evidence]!""

Please don't tell me what I find ""hard to conceive"".  I can conceive of it just fine, I'm clearly an adult with a brain.  Saying ""it's hard for you to conceive of X"" is an insult.  It's a way to call someone dumb and act like you're not doing it, you should avoid that in the future unless your intent is to insult.

This is a case of a person who didn't like how the mods did something, said ""I'm gonna deliberately fuck with them"" and then got banned, and acts like this is ""malice"".  This is not at all malice.  This is **at best** a person who complained about the noise in a restaurant to no avail being kicked out after they started yelling loudly to make a point.

Simply listing a false dillema doesn't make it so.  The obvious answer is 4. They're not the **same exact circumstance**.

> This is a tricky line, since there's absolutely no recourse against mods who specifically fuck with users.

If by ""fuck with users"" you mean, ban them.  There are usually other mods on the team.  If they agree with the ban then no, there's no recourse.  There shouldn't be.  Any time this ever comes up people complain there is no recourse but never once has anyone suggested a remotely plausible recourse that could exist.  The admins can't **possibly** adjudictate every ban.  Even me just replying to you, who made an account **specifically to fuck with the mods and make a point** has taken at least 10-15 minutes.  If everyone who's ban was as justified as the one you receieved demanded 10-15 min of admin time they'd have to literally hire dozens if not hundreds of staff people.  It'd be completely untenable.  In addition admins (as humans) will undoubtedly remove a ban that should be put in place, then what?  Are mods forbidden from punishing users ever, do they have free reign to do as they like now?  The other oft-cited ""recourse"" is a way to vote out mods, but I think the downsides of that are so obvious it'd be a waste of time to list them.  So list a tenable recourse, otherwise this talk is meaningless.

There is no recourse if you disagree with a mod team over a ban you got because even if a recourse was good for reddit (I don't think it is), no reasonable one exists besides making a new sub (the recourse the admins list in the FAQ)

Right to bare arms, and the right to free speech, because if you cannot speak, you cannot organize, and if you cannot bare arms, your movement has no teeth if peace doesn't work.

Will you ever change their minds? no, probably not. but, a susceptible person may be watching and realize that your point proves the nazi's viewpoint is absurd. Silencing them you make people ask questions, are they right? why are they being silenced? why not just say they are wrong and prove it?

> You're the mod of Eli5. Do you moderate based on feel, or guidelines? What do you do about moderators who bring their personal issues into their moderation actions? E.g. banning people they don't like (outside Reddit) without eli5-related cause because they're simply in a position to do so?

**How do you know this is what happened?**  I'm accused weekly of banning someone for <insert completely fabricated reason>.  Someone feeling that a ban was based on personal issues is not at all evidence it's based on that.

(All this said, I wouldn't even concede that mods shouldn't be able to ban users for actions taken elsewhere.  If Bob from the Klan rally shows up at your party, and isn't currently yelling slurs, I don't see an issue with expelling him from your house)

> If a teacher repeatedly just told you to shut and stand in a corner for no reason, that's harassment.

That's not at all what a ban is.  A ban is someone expelling you from their house, and not letting you back in.  You're not forced to stand anywhere, you're not forced to be quiet, you just don't get to be in their house.  Is expelling someone from your house harassment?  Of course not.

> No. A wrongful arrest has recourse in the US. The officer who made the wrongful arrest can be sued, put on trial, and gotten fired for his misdemeanor.

Here's where the analogy breaks down, a ban is not an arrest, not even a little bit.  It's a guy expelling you from his house party.  You have no recourse for that, and you shouldn't have any recourse.

> My position isn't that mods shouldn't be allowed to ban on their own subs. My position is that mods shouldn't be allowed to trigger site-wide bans after they themselves have been harassing users in direct violation of the ""don't break Reddit"" clause.

I don't believe this is happening. As far as anyone has explicity said here, the incident in question is:

1. User banned, mod doesn't say publicly why the ban happened, or the user doesn't feel the ban is justified
2. User makes new account to keep posting in sub, evading the ban.
3. Mods message admins when it's discovered and admins punish user for ban evasion.

**Did all these events not happen in this order?**  If so, the user should be punished, they broke **extremely clear** site wide rules.  It doesn't matter at all if other things happened before, after or in between these events.

Please explain what exactly is this harassment you're talking about.  It can't just be ""someone was banned from a sub"".  That's not **at all** harasssment.  Harassment isn't ""someone did something I don't like"", harassment isn't ""someone expelled me from their house"".",False,False,1517363295.0,194515,6398,1239548171.0,False,True

Common sense is that ban evasion = evading a ban.  Anything more is your own opinion unsupported by reddit history, or admin actions.  Ban evasion is not ""evading a ban <with my own personal conditions>"" it's just ""evading a ban"".  It's quite possibly the most simple and clear cut of all reddit rules.  I'm genuinely surprised that someone would interpret it other than the most obvious possible way.

> read the rest or the other comments in the list of context.

I don't know what you mean by ""list of context"" here.  But I've read an enormous amount of the comments here and responded in detail to all of them.  I think it's unfair for you to suggest I'm not reading things given the time I'm putting into the responses here.

> Because, if you refer to the original complaint it was about being banned and muted and stopped from being able to communicate and discuss the ban.

You contacted them.  They chose to not respond.  You're not owed their attention forever.  Should mods be compelled to discuss a ban just because the user feels like posting more replies?  Before the mute I've had users who literally posted day and night for weeks in modmail.  How much should I be forced to read?

> That's literally impossible to know unless someone speaks up and tells thier story.

There's no way on earth that's possible.  Describe a realistic recourse you could imagine which wouldn't require reddit to get 100x the paid staff.

> In my case, I asked the mods via modmail without response; when someone else brought it up on the sub (not me), the mod in question simply removed the thread. I.e. the mod misdemeanor was sacrosanct.

Sacrosanct?  That's awfully dramatic for ""mod removes meta thread complaining about a ban"".  Please share a screenshot of the modmail message you sent to the mods of that sub.

> Not dissimilar from the cop shooting someone out of spite, and other cops arguing that well, cops have to shoot sometimes.

Again, you're MASSIVELY dramatizing something without much of a basis.  Literally every single week I ban someone who complains the ban was unjustified.  It's not shooting someone.

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.

The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s, while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.

***

**And you are lynching Negroes**

""And you are lynching Negroes"" (Russian: ""А у вас негров линчуют"", A u vas negrov linchuyut) and the later ""And you are hanging blacks"" are catchphrases which the Soviet Union used in response to American criticisms of its human rights violations. Use of the phrases, exemplifying the tu quoque tactic, was an attempt to deflect criticism of the Soviet Union by referring to racial discrimination and lynching in the United States.

The Soviet media frequently covered racial discrimination, financial crises, and unemployment in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used as a form of rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings.

There are three reasons to ban this sort of racism from reddit that have nothing to do with ""heresy.""

First: because it is an intellectually indefensible position that is clearly accepted and propagated because of the desire of its adherents to view some people as subhuman. It is not part of any valuable discourse. There is no genuine debate. It is an idea advanced only because it is useful—because it is a weapon—for those who wish to express their contempt for black people. 

Second: because the expression of those ideas reveals the incredible mediocrity of the speaker. Somebody who feels the need to participate in this elaborate role-playing game of racial superiority contributes nothing valuable to his community. He contributes nothing valuable to those who interact with him. He is not just disgusting, he is boring. 

Third: because giving it a forum attracts the sort of warped and bitter homunculi that like racism, and like their toxic beliefs, and want to talk to people who feel the same way they do. These echo chambers of racism and small-mindedness emerge, they grow, and eventually they metastasize. The toxicity of racists is not contained in their idiotic subreddits; it infects other communities populated by ordinary decent people whose experience is spoiled by exposure to that filth. 

I have the feeling, based on your responses so far, that all you'll take from this is ""disagreement is heresy."" If you reduce all disagreement to the simple form of one man saying A and another saying B, then sure—but by the same token, a man who says the earth is flat just disagrees with the rest of us. A man who says that it is okay to murder or rape children just disagrees with the mainstream view.

I don't think it as simple as 'ban bad ideas', 'ban hatred'. People know what hatred is when they see it.

If a Muslim subreddit kept having posts about how women are inferior reach its front page, and was a breeding ground for hatred. 

Ban it. (I'd be first in line to ask for its ban as a Muslim myself, as a matter of fact if there any such subreddits, let me know and I'll add them to my original post and ask /u/spez to ban those too). 

The thing is, my post wasn't about what I think Reddit *should* be, it's about what /u/spez wants reddit to be. 

As long as T_D and other white supremacist subreddits continue to dominate and flourish on the platform, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the world notices and declares reddit a platform for white supremacists. We saw it happen with /r/jailbait and the fappening etc. At that point, /u/spez or the CEO at the time will be under a great amount of pressure to ban it. Even if they do, Reddit's reputation will once again be in shambles. 

------

However, your point about banning 'bad ideas' is one of the great debates I believe America needs, and why your tone earlier was frustrating. 

The First Amendment is a cornerstone of the American identity, but it only applies to the government. However, what responsibility do private companies such as reddit, twitter, facebook etc. have to uphold it? Does that responsibility outweigh the responsibility to speak out and act against hatred?

Classical liberalism is a political ideology and a branch of liberalism which advocates civil liberties under the rule of law with an emphasis on economic freedom. Closely related to libertarianism and to economic liberalism, it developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to urbanization and to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States. Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include John Locke, Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo. It drew on the economics of Adam Smith and on a belief in natural law, utilitarianism and progress.

So Person A was trying to antagonize the people who made the rule to make a point?  I'd kick them out too.

The difference with your extension is that I suspect most people aren't annoyed by person B.  If they were they would have left the community, like someone would in a restaurant.

If you are saying that this: https://www.reddit.com//r/RightAgainstTrump/wiki/violence has dozens of examples. I won't disagree, but you will have to give me the actual examples in that list that haven't been deleted. I went through around 20 of them at random and they were either deleted or not actually threatening violence.

I can't hold the mods responsible for comments that are hateful but yet they delete. If I do hold them responsible, in order to not be a hypocrite, I would have to advocate banning any sub that has ever had anyone say anything hateful.

""The ones that still exist and haven't been deleted don't count because doxxing, harassing random trans people, infighting violence and hatred isn't ""bad"" enough for you, or is apparently the same as hating a member of the government who has put himself in the limelight to do something particularly bad. ""

I didn't say any of that. In fact I argued that the example I was given *wasn't* an example of those. 

The only ""whataboutism"" I employed was me trying to point out a different point of view that can't be overlooked. I wasn't saying that anytime something hateful is said on T_D and isn't deleted the mods didn't see it. I said that you can't accuse them of being racist for not deleting things they don't see.

""I'll leave you with a note from a mod there: ""Transphobia is not against the rules"". But they're unaware of it, deleting it, and totally not harassing anyone, right?"" 

A couple problems with your example. That post is from March. **Two** years ago. For all I know that mod has been removed by now. (You are welcome to prove me wrong... Or you can just insult me and refuse to provide evidence... Thereby cementing my opinion that you are just blowing hot air. Seriously, I wouldn't mind being proven wrong.)

Also, last I checked (and it has been awhile) reddit itself doesn't have a rule against transphobia and (at the time at least) T_D definitely didn't. So therefore the mods claim *is* accurate. That doesn't mean I like it. (I don't) But that doesn't make it sufficient grounds to ban the subreddit without changes to reddit's rules.

Again, I stated that harassment (http://www.dictionary.com/browse/harassment) requires the ""target"" to be involved. Otherwise any time I say something not nice about someone -in private- to a different person I am harassing them. You can attempt to change my understanding of the phrase, but that seems unlikely as the legal definition also generally agrees with my sentiment. https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/harassment


I did notice while writing this response that the person I responded to edited their original comment to include more examples. I didn't get a notification or them telling me they did so. That is a very underhanded way to make me look like an idiot. (And unethical, especially when they use that as a way to attack me.)

If you open yourself up to reality for a few minutes notice three things: I never said I liked T_D, I didn't say I like the people who post there (or even approve of them) and I've never posted there. (Not even on an alt.)  What I did say is that I haven't seen evidence of subreddit bannable offenses (that weren't removed quite quickly.)

Elaborate on ""you are NOT banned from contacting MEMBERS OF THE SUBREDDIT""

What **specific actions** are you saying a person is not banned from taking here.

As far as I can tell the only three things you could mean are:

1. When you are banned from a subreddit you are NOT banned from posting new threads
2. When you are banned from a subreddit you are NOT banned from making comments in threads
3. When you are banned from a subreddit you are NOT banned from messaging users.

if you meant 1 and 2 you are obviously wrong, as that's exactly what a ban means.  So I assumed 3.  Please explain another option, since I genuinely have no idea what you mean if you don't mean one of these three specific actions.

> Literally a guy up near the parent of this thread telling his tale of that happening.

What is to elaborate? Mods are also members of the sub, being banned from a sub does not ban you from contacting members of the sub, this includes mods. As such it is not ban evasion to use an alt to contact a member of the sub. 

>What specific actions are you saying a person is not banned from taking here.

Exactly what I said above.

>As far as I can tell the only three things you could mean are:

When you are banned from a subreddit you are NOT banned from posting new threads
When you are banned from a subreddit you are NOT banned from making comments in threads
When you are banned from a subreddit you are NOT banned from messaging users.
if you meant 1 and 2 you are obviously wrong, as that's exactly what a ban means. So I assumed 3. Please explain another option, since I genuinely have no diea what you mean if you don't mean one of these three specific actions.

Congrats, number 3 is the winner, as it should have been obvious to anyone.

Again, I didn't say that someone who disagrees with my views is evil by default. I said that if they are intentionally deceiving people they are an asshole. Very different.

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.

The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s, while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.

It's  quite cunning. 

If you refuse to give in to him you will appear to actually be harassing him, because the poor guy just has to have the last word, *begging* you to stop replying to him. 

If you do give in then he can claim victory as well, then he'll say you stopped replying because you knew you were harassing him or the authorities made you stop. 

Either way he wins.

Wins at being a dirty cheat and horrible liar, but still wins, in his mind and perhaps in the minds of those not paying close enough attention to the sleight of hand as well.

It's because you are absurd. Genuinely absurd. 
This is an anonymous internet forum and you seem to have some bizarre, fucked up idea of what entails ""harassment."" At any moment in this conversation ***YOU*** have had many choices. MANY ways to end this. 

Let's list them off:

* Ignore me. Do not reply.
* Block me. Never see anything I post again.
* Claim harassment over and over while 'politely' asking me to stop 'contacting' you.

You chose ""Claim harassment over and over while 'politely' asking me to stop 'contacting' you."" Which clearly is not working. But what's that! You have other tools at your disposal! You could cease this thing you call ""harassment"" at any time, but YOU are the one choosing to continue it just as much as I am. Comment chains are not a one way street, bud. You have to reply to me just as much as I have to reply to you.

So if you truly want me to stop replying to you, stop replying back. Or, if you find me so unfathomably intimidating that you cannot stomach ever seeing anything I post again, BLOCK ME. I don't care. It would make me a bit sad, because then all this fun would be over, but that's a choice you can make here. And for whatever reason, you are not making it. Stubbornness, I suppose? I don't know.
