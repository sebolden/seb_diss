You're missing the most important step here: incorporating the suggested feedback and having leadership that has sufficient resolve and tenacity to change track when they see something isn't working as one'd hoped.


----

I'd love a list of the 10 biggest changes in policy and vision you've made as a result of user-feedback since the alpha of the redesign.

Where were you most wrong and what did you learn from being wrong on those issues? How is that helping the team get the redesign even more right prior to launch?",False,False,False,201929,21008,1345491898.0,False,True

[This is what we have setup currently](https://i.imgur.com/xOdFQBy.jpg) over at /r/NieR

* We have a basic animated banner.
* Posts are stylised, and have a number count against them.
* Thumbnails change depending on the post type (NSFW, Spoliers, Discussions, Announcements).
* Submission buttons overlapping the sidebar image.
* Custom userflairs with popup text upon mouseover.

None of this is at all achievable with your redesign, and furthermore what you can change is heavily restricted:

* Banner image heights are limited to 3 sizes, with very little control over their placement.
* All colours are purely static, no gradient support at all.
* The new userflairs are a huge step backwards in what you can do with them.

The whole thing quite frankly sucks in its current implementation, the only redeeming feature from this entire thing is the new configurable post requirements section.

**Breaking down a standard submission:**

[Here's an image](https://i.imgur.com/c53kfWT.png)

-1. As mentioned above, our thumbnails are different depending on post type, you can currently only assign one ""default"" thumbnail in the redesign, there's no ability to configure these for spoilers/nsfw etc. There's no ability to set the size of the thumbnails either, they're something like 40x60, so no nice uniform square thumbnails.

-2. There doesn't seem to be a way to align submission flairs to the left hand side, with the redesign they're always on the right, not to mention you cannot style them.


-3. This is the overall background image of the post, you can currently change this in the redesign but then it'd clash with item 4 which is a second background decor image placed in the corner, the redesign only allows you to set one BG image, and very little control is given as to how you'd like to use it.


-5. Much like post flairs, there's really no customisability in the redesign for userflairs. 


-6. No ability to even show post rankings, let alone style them.

There's a load of other things i'd like to go into such as the inability to use a different font, change text colour, and so on but there's really no point.

If not, you run the risk of third-party analytics (people posting images which track who's looked at a post). Imagine if Facebook and imgur struck a deal. Any image hosted on imgur and hotlinked into a comment. Imgur puts a cookie on your computer. Facebook now knows you hang out at /r/ClopClop...

If so, be mindful on a couple of things (which you're probably already aware of):

Most (if not all) bitmap formats (jpg, png, etc) put the header at the beginning of the file. The file is read until the end of the data, not the end of the file. RAR archives put the header at the END of the file. If you take a JPG and use:

    copy /b 1.jpg + 2.rar combinedfile.jpg

You'll end up with an file which displays a picture in the browser and can also be opened with 7zip. I'd suggest implementing both a size limitation and a file truncator (your server looks at the image's header and discards everything after the end of the image data.

Current Reddit is unpredictable in terms of Title-Click behavior, and while an experienced Redditor knows what post type does what, through our user research sessions over the past year, we found that for any new user, this is an non-optimal experience. We opted to consolidate all title clicks to lead to one location. In most of our post types, it leads to conversation. Over time and a lot of feedback from the redesign community, we made link click behavior more prominent in terms of indication of clickable thumbnail and outbound source after the title.

Overall, we think this approach best sets our users up for success in terms of not having to think about what goes where, and understand that the change in functionality can be frustrating.

If you're doing a redesign, you're better off thinking of ways to improve your site's core functionalities instead of adding a new one (chat) that runs contrary to your modus operandi instead of taking your core stuff forward.

I'll be the first to criticize reddit's main design for not allowing group conversations but instead just comment threads where people reply to one another on a one-by-one basis. You can't have a group discussion or subscribe to a comment thread.

The logic for this is that with infinite scroll, they want there to be a fast and logical way for you to return to your place in the home feed without losing your place. If you middle click / open in new tab, you get a non pop-up version of the thread, so IMO you're already able to choose how you want to view.

Well, speaking as an r/politics mod, I *do* always want the rules widget to be visible at least. As for the rest of the sidebar - they only recently started having all widgets show up and I'm not sure I care? I guess as long as there has to be space over there for rules - and ads, which I'm guessing is the main reason - might as well load the entire sidebar.

To your perspective, you are perfectly able to comment and post, but no one else is able to see it. According to the last announcement where it was discussed, admins try to only use the operation for spambot accounts.

If you post something and a moderator or automoderator bans you, you are given a message informing you that you are banned from that subreddit. After that point, you can no longer comment or submit posts in that subreddit, but you can still read and upvote/downvote.

I *think* you are referring to a trick that some subreddits do, where they modify their automoderator script to detect submissions authored by a given user and quietly deletes that activity. I've heard this referred to as an automod-ban or a stealth-ban, but there's no ""official"" term for it, because it's just a manipulation of the scripting mechanism. 

I believe you are talking about that third type. I was not aware of many subreddits bothering to use this much anymore. All you need to do to detect if this has happened to you in a sub is to post a perfectly innocuous comment, and then sign out, refresh the page, and see if your comment is visible (it sometimes takes a moment).

Whenever this third type of ban happens, it means that a moderator with permission to edit the automoderator script has taken the time to edit the script to add your username to the list. This is not an operation that can be performed by automoderator; as in, there's no (normal) way to instruct automoderator to start deleting everything you post from that moment on, just because it detected that you posted something against the rules.

Now outside of the automod script, people can write more formalized bots that can be granted moderator priviliges. Those can then use the reddit API to issue a traditional subreddit ban. At one point, people were writing scripts that would scan activity even on *other* subreddits, and ban you from a subreddit that you've never even operated  in. I'm opposed to this. And this was brought up repeatedly back when they were doing the community_dialogue effort.

But as far as polarizing political subreddits, as long as a subreddit's moderation team has the liberty to ban however they please, this is still going to be every bit as much of a problem as it currently is now. The only way to solve this is to use a *completely* different platform that involved a stronger mechanism for meta-moderation, such that moderators can be taken to task for issuing bans to users who are participating in civil discussion. Wikipedia, for example, has such a mechanism and it's explicitly defined. However, it's also *extremely* complicated.

Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. He was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons, the website framework web.py, and the social news site Reddit, in which he became a partner after its merger with his company, Infogami.

Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism.

I'm sure the entire design team knows this, but for others who aren't as deep into the subject, here's a short overview.

---

The properties of the objects need to lead users to use them correctly. A door you need to pull should have a handle that leads to you pull it. An automatically sliding door shouldn't have one. 

When we navigate the web and click on something, we expect to arrive at that something. 

That's the most basic affordance of hyperlinking and it isn't something reddit can change unless they find a better solution to the same inherent design-problem across the web.

It's less clear cut with pictures: on some sites clicking on a clickable picture leads the picture to be enlarged, on other sites it leads to the image file or something else.

---

The basic, most common affordance of hyperlinking online, whenever you scroll through some feed, or are on some landing page, clicking on the title of a submission, you expect to come to that submission.

So inherently, marking the different use case, the text-post that exists on reddit and should lead to a comment page, should clearly and obviously  be distinguished from off-site links.

That means that self-post elements should be designed differently to link-posts so we intuitively realize they're different and should expect different results by clicking on them.

Alternatively, you get rid of link posts altogether (as in the redesign where you always land on the comments). If that's the goal, reddit has changed form its outset as a content aggregate.

By claiming that it ""incited violence"", I can only assume that reddit was including suicide as ""violence against the self"", but even then, that's tenuous. It's more of a philosophical argument than anything else, can you commit violence on yourself? Or does violence imply a lack of consent?

""The vast majority of suicides are unnecessary reactions, because most people recover from suicidal depression.""

This is exactly the reason that Sanctioned Suicide existed, to provide a place to talk free of this opinion. It's unfounded, and very hurtful. Even if we assume that it's true, what about the minority that don't recover from depression? Or who aren't depressed? Or you are making a rational choice to end their lives? That was the purpose of SS. /r/depression, /r/suicidewatch, etc, are for the ""majority"" who are getting better or want to get better. There is now nowhere for the minority, the ones who won't get better, and despite what society tells us, sometimes, people don't make it. Not everyone has their happy ending.

""But that sort of thing is not the type of thing that needs to be discussed with random people who don't know you, but with your doctors and friends and family.""

So, you're saying people aren't allowed to discus personal issues on the internet? If that was true, social media as a concept wouldn't exist. People wouldn't talke about childbirth, cancer, personal finance, etc, because they are ""personal"". The anonymity of the internet provides a voice that many people, including myself, would be unable or unwilling to use without that anonymity. That voice is now gone, and while I can understand why reddit did this (To cover themselves legally, I expect) I can't agree that there was ""not much reason"" to keep that sub. There is nowhere for people like me to go now. There are a few ""spinoffs"" from SS, but I'm sure they will either die due to inactivity, or be banned as well in the coming days or weeks.

""Every single person who killed themselves after reading that sub would be Reddit's fault.""

This would be the perception, and is, no doubt, the reason for the banning, but it is untrue. Sanctioned Suicide, as it name implied, simply respected the free and personal choice of an individual to end their lives. It did not encourage or suggest it, that choice and that responsibility always lay with that individual.

That's equivalent (essentially) to saying ""If you need a place for people to talk about religion, then it needs to be based on Christian ideology"" or ""If you need a place to talk about homosexuality, then it needs to be anti-gay rights"". Why does discussion of suicide need to be life-affirming?

> The vast majority of suicides are unnecessary reactions, because most people recover from suicidal depression.

*Most* people recover from suicidal depression? Do they, really? I wouldn't be so sure about that. First, there is the fact that there is a large enough number of people who say that they are depressed, but are not actually depressed - thanks to depression having become a bit of a ""fashionable"" thing in recent times. These people will say that they are depressed over minor (and ultimately inconsequential) things and sometimes go as far as to say that it'd be nice if they were dead, so that they didn't have to deal with it. As soon as those 'problems' resolve for them, they will say that they are no longer depressed and suicidal. This gives people who have never experienced real depression the idea that depression (and thus also suicidality) is something that is easily solvable or something that a person can ultimately just snap out of. This is at the cost of the people who are *truly* depressed and suicidal, because they will be taken less seriously as a result. The faux depressed essentially give the real depressed a bad name, often unintentionally so.

In addition to this, there is also the fact that whenever the general public gets to hear people talk about their failed suicide attempt, it is always done in a pro-life manner. You always only ever hear about the people who regretted their attempts and subsequently were able to find meaning in their existence again. You never hear about the people who didn't regret their failed suicide attempt (other than the fact that it failed) and are determined to do it again. There are *plenty* of those out there, but society does not agree with their viewpoints, so they are hidden from view. In other words: the general public is only allowed to hear about one side of the coin and members of the general public are not interested enough to voluntarily want to do some digging of their own and find out more about the other side of the coin. In fact, most do not even care to educate themselves on the *very basics* of depression and suicidality by reading a book about it (preferably a scientifically-minded one instead of e.g. one that is written from a religious point of view). They will just remember the bits that society feeds them through the media every now and then, and then just mindlessly follow the narrative that society has laid out for them.

When you combine all of this and other similar things (that involve misinformation and misconceptions), it is clear to see that there is significant potential for the non-depressed to be easily misled into concluding that most people recover from suicidal depression. That is not necessarily the case at all. The reality is much more likely to be less simplistic and darker than that.

> But that sort of thing is not the type of thing that needs to be discussed with random people who don't know you, but with your doctors and friends and family.

It would indeed be wonderfully ideal if suicidal people were able to discuss such things with their friends and family, but that is not a realistic expectation to have. At all. For example, such things need to be discussed calmy, rationally and without judgement - and friends and family are often too close to the suicidal person for them to be able to do so. That is, when the suicidal person comes from a non-abusive family and even has friends. They will react emotionally (and even hysterically in some cases) and as a result, subsequently make decisions that *might* come from a place of good intentions, but are actually not thought through and misguided and will often leave the suicidal person even worse off. Such as calling the police on them or having them be forcibly hospitalised against their own will for ""their own good"". Do you *really* think that that will make suicidal people feel warmly understood and invited to share more about what they are going through? Do force and draconian measures *really* make life seem more bright again? Quite the opposite, in fact. It removes trust and the inclination to talk about it with people for good and makes the suicidal person put the little energy they have left into putting up a socially acceptable mask of fake happiness. As a result, the suicidal person's sense of being misunderstood and alone is increased. Ultimately, the suicidal person will end up feeling that they are being kept here against their will.

A doctor isn't going to be of much help in this either, by the way, because they will be afraid of possible lawsuits from grieving but irrational relatives and the like. So even if he or she personally respects your wish to die, he or she will not do anything about it in order to protect themselves (which is understandable in the current pro-life climate). At best, they might be knowingly passive in the whole process and essentially leave you to your own devices. At worst, they will diligently follow the whole ""Keep you alive at all costs!"" script (which includes forced hospitalisation) so that afterwards, not even the best attorney will be able to build a case against them for medical malpractice or something along those lines.

So, all in all, doctors and family and friends are not the go-to option as they might seem at first glance. They might be for everything else, but not for suicide. Not if you want to avoid having your freedom and privacy taken away and subsequently be violated in many ways (be they subtle or not so subtle)... if you want to avoid being made to feel less than human.

And all this while it is a suicidal person's *own* body and *own* life. Why is it that society is okay with people doing all sorts of things with their bodies because it is *their* body and *their* life (""live and let live""), but as soon as these people wish for their bodies to die and make active preparations for it, suddenly society claims it has the right to butt in and have a say about people's bodies and lives? What gives society the right? People are not owned by society, we are not slaves. Society is quite hypocritical as well, by the way. You can enlist in the army at age 18 and subsequently be shipped off to war zones (where you could *die* at any moment) as soon as your training is complete, but when an adult of 30, 55 or even 72 decides after long and careful contemplation that they want to take their own life, it has to be prevented *at all costs*?! These double standards that society has, are much sicker and unhealthier than any suicidal person that is being honest about their feelings and taking steps to do what they feel is best for them. Why can't people let other people alone? Stop infantilising people and nannying them. Let them make decisions for themselves, otherwise people are just glorified slaves in a hamster wheel. Their body, their life, their choice.

Also, sometimes the most loving thing to do, is to let someone go. I'm saying that as someone who is not only suicidal, but has also lost people (including a close relative) to suicide. But unfortunately, it seems that most people aren't capable of that kind of open-mindedness, strength and altruism. That is a right shame, but hopefully that will improve somewhat in the coming decades.

> Every single person who killed themselves after reading that sub would be Reddit's fault.

No, people are responsible for their own decisions, actions, bodies and lives. Including their interpretation of the texts that they come across on the Internet. It is unfair to put that on Reddit.

> If you need a place for suicidal people to talk, then it needs to be life affirming.

If you dearly love life and enjoy being alive, then good for you. You belong to a fortunate and privileged group of people then. However, that does *not* give you the right to dictate that any communities dealing with suicide should automatically be life-affirming and thus inherently anti-suicide. Your reality is not necessarily that of other people's and neither are your views and opinions. You have no right to impose your reality, views and opinions onto other people to the point of forcibly shoving it down their throats. I certainly do not have the right to do such things to you, which I'm sure you would agree with. So why does it appear that you think that you somehow do have the right to do that to me and other suicidal people?

I just went over to r/politics and opened the “Mueller subpoenas Trump organization post” and saw 13 Russian shill accusation in less than 3 minutes of browsing through the comments.

It's worth pointing out that the latest alpha iteration did make the external URL more obvious buy exposing more of the URL slug, and coloring it in that familiar blue hyperlink color. 

Personally, I agree with others who suggest that any attempt to de-emphasize external URL's will negatively impact click through and hence decreases the number of people who read the content. But I think you and I both know that they are not turning back from the current design where submission titles will open the thread.

Though they've already tried to compromise with the new exposed URL method, I think something similar to [/u/majorparadox's proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/81baxs/mockup_for_moving_new_url_links_under_the_title/) might be in order.

A shadowban is a status placed against your account that hides all of your submissions from **all users, in all subreddits,** except the moderators of the subreddit you are posting in, and to yourself hence shadowban as you aren't made aware of the fact nobody else can see your posts.

You're talking about automod rules being set up by the mod team to remove specific posts, and submissions, that they themselves configure and manage. This is not a shadowban. I agree that this is also an issue, but this is enforced by that subreddits modteam, and is really no different from them going in and silently removing your comments/posts without telling you.

I don't know - I suspect at *least* a year, maybe a few. There are some old options that reddit inc has allowed to keep running for a surprisingly long time (see: the reddit compact site). 

The problem becomes that there are a number of new features in the redesign that don't necessarily degrade gracefully to the 'old' site. One big one: emoji. The product team wants subreddits to phase out use of CSS 'image flair' in favor of 'emoji flair', which will be better standardized and visible to users on mobile. But on the 'old' site, that will only be visible as a :text: tag. 

There are more little things like that, which I suspect will pile up and make the 'old' site somewhat of a chore for users, mods and the design team themselves.

Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.

Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance.

* Somewhat sensible: Some people have very large widescreen monitors and browse fullscreen, and it truly is more difficult to read large blocks of text if the linewrap is 20inches away from line-end to line-beginning.

* From good to bad: Studies and articles (like these: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=optimal+line+length ) have long told page-layout designers to use a ~75 character maximum (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length#Printed_text). This is partially why dictionaries and newspapers have narrower-than-full-page-width columns (2 or 3 or 4 columns depending on page width). People who don't spend most of their waking hours reading text, seem to be more appreciative of this line-length (and people with vision problems and dyslexia too). People who want to fill their window no matter what width, are frustrated by this.

* Very frustrating: having a maximum width (even in a responsive design), makes it easier to make a semi-predictable layout, which is good for designers. This often leads to daft problems, e.g. most News websites.

* Diversity: Some people are overwhelmed by very dense text or UIs. They would rather scroll a lot, or have options hidden. This group includes both old-timers (who deal with constant frustration) and newcomers.

Which is good, as I would hate that. I often reopen the same content if it has a lot more comments. So fading should be comment based. 

The third is ""why are you still restricting the front page to 50 subreddits?"" I don't have more than that, so it's not a big deal to me. But surely the tech has evolved to where you can just include all the subreddits. 

The fourth is that you  need to take into account how some subreddits are specifically repetitious and only work because they have fewer subscribers. I actually did wind up unsubbing a subreddit that I had before almost never saw on my front page, maybe one per visit. But lately I started seeing more, and it annoyed me enough to unsub.

He had the domain [bits.are.notabug.com](http://archive.is/d4NPt) before reddit existed and

[not a bug](http://archive.is/eBNaf) was the name of reddit's parent company when it was acquired by Conde Nast.

T_D being banned is not about people liking them or not disliking them. It is the fact that they are spreading, in a **purposeful manner**, misinformation and propaganda meant to create chaos and sow distrust between americans. 

There is proof that the T_D has been pushing Russian propaganda, there is proof that the T_D has been pushing for violence and unrest, there is proof that T_D is sowing seeds of distrust.

for r//trees, all the users do there is smoke an unadulterated plant that grows freely in nature in many places in the world, and hang out being mellow after smoking it. They don't bother anyone, they are not spreading propaganda, they are not creating chaos, they are not pushing for violence.

Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law. In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain federal acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with federal law.

The pricing for Google, Yahoo, or Bing on a website are $4-5 per thousand queries.

How many queries are Redditors doing? It can't be that many if Reddit doesn't feel the imperative to implement a better internal query system.

The suggestion that I want them banned because I don't agree with them is ridiculous.

> If they truly are breaking rules then they would have been banned by now.

You'd think that, and that's why I'm not letting it go.

T_D was caught brigading, red-handed, multiple times. That's why they were pulled from the front page. And they have a long standing history of doxxing and witch-hunting as well as an ongoing racist component to the overall culture of the subreddit. I know this isn't hyperbole, because I spent a second on the sub, and I know it's a serious problem that Reddit is for whatever reason refusing to address, because I stayed longer than that.

I wish you wouldn't characterize my concerned position as being a whining crybaby who isn't getting what he wants. I'm not whining, and this isn't about what I want, it's about what I am deeply concerned is contributing to a shittier version of American culture.

I also wish you wouldn't parade free speech around as if it's a relevant issue here. The right to free speech is enshrined in the constitution, but the right to use privately-owned social media to broadcast and magnify hate speech is not constitutionally protected. And the idea that there is an exchange of ideas between people with opposing views is nonsensical. T_D is not exchanging ideas, they are polluting discourse and there is *ample* evidence that there are many people on T_D who are on the Russian payroll and who have been directed to stir shit up, who have been directed to start conversations like this one. They're trying to influence our country to be divided and afraid, and I don't feel it's whiny to be concerned about that.

These answers obviously only apply IAMA, but:

>If you don't mind me asking, how many hours a day did you have to do ""mod duties""?  

No required hours in IAMA. I typically had 2-3 hours of modding in a normal day while I was between task at work. Usually I'd just read AMAs and remove comments as needed, occasionally checking modmail to help people out. With IAMA, we also have to check out people's proof as well, and that usually happens in modmail or email.

>Were you working during it?  

Yea, this is how I slacked off at work. I had an IT support job then, but had a lot of downtime when stuff wasn't breaking.  

> Did you have any social life outside the internet?  

Yep. It didn't really impact my life much.  
>I'm imagining moderators as those who live in their parents house on their PCs all day, as that's the only way I can possibly imagine they'd be able to moderate- or do mods take ""shifts?""  

Lol. Our mods are mostly working professionals putting in a few hours a day. I don't think any of us live with our parents. IAMA in particular is mostly only active during work hours in the US which makes it easier for a dozen or so active mods to keep an eye on things when we have time. We have a couple mods based in asia/australia who cover the night shift pretty well - not much going on.

>Are there strict schedules/hours you're expected to keep up?

No. If a mod doesn't do any mod actions for a couple of months we usually check in and see if they're okay. We don't kick mods for inactivity. If we find that we're not able to keep up with things as a team, we recruit a few new mods.",False,False,False,137522,42355,1279857224.0,False,True

I've also witnessed conservatives attempt to defend their views and have their arguments completely unraveled. And threads where people within both parties are split on issues. That seems fine.

It's unfortunate that people use downvotes for anything they dislike, but reddit's Eternal September has made herding those cats impossible.

I'm not even going to begin to consider the problems that would arise from actually trying to enforce any site-wide method of keeping discussion of news open to all perspectives.

Looking at your opening reply:

>LOL is there any evidence that Trump didn't say anything because they're black, or is that just because the media told you Trump's a racist and you don't want to think for yourself?

You've probably been downvoted because you're coming off as flippant and letting your feelings about the community in general bleed through rather than simply calling the specific assertion into question.

""LOL"": Suggests that you think the entire premise, which the majority is running with, can't be taken seriously.  
""the media told you Trump's a racist and you don't want to think for yourself?"": Suggests that you don't believe Trump is racist - unpopular opinion in them parts - and that they wouldn't have deduced it from his words and actions.

You've called everyone's ability to think into question before engaging with anyone in particular - attacking them, and not the assertion. It comes off as rude, and sets the tone for the reply chain.

However, when someone replied (also somewhat flippantly), you continued to engage, asking for proof of their remarks - and since your post here, they bothered to check the accuracy of their statements, admitted they were wrong about something (?! THAT HAPPENED *AGAIN?!*), and provided an article to back up another one of their statements.

So while it may be harder to communicate, it *isn't impossible*, and it might've been easier to reach more people with careful phrasing. (""How do we know the victims' races are the reason Trump hasn't commented on the attacks? Can anyone share something to support that?"")

I'd advise you to stick around and keep calling out articles that jump to conclusions or contain questionable information - every individual fighting against a collective bias helps. Reaching someone is better than reaching no one, as someone can reach someone but no one can't reach someone, and also, no one can't reach someone if that someone is within reach of everyone, but if they have claustrophobia and they run fast enough that can turn into no one being able to reach someone *real* fast.",False,False,False,15495,3330,1325127777.0,False,True
