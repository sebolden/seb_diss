While I doubt we'll ever find out exactly what changes were a direct command from Ellen, the one that I found most curious was demanding all employees move to San Francisco. To me, one of the successes of reddit was how all of these amazingly talented people from across the globe could work together without HAVING to be together. With a global reach for staffing, you're able to have the best team possible, but by demanding geographics, you're limiting yourself to whose willing to move/deal with the cost of living in San Francisco, etc.

I understand that face-to-face working/meeting is different than virtual, but where I work, because of geography, we simply can't be all be in the same place, and that's just the reality of it. There is no way to congregate everyone. We trust everyone to perform their roles, have a reporting process and meet regularly through teleconference and video conference.

When reddit announced/commanded that everyone must move to San Francisco to remain employed I saw that as the end to reddit as it was. Even if everybody moved, you'd have a lot of people who didn't want to and were leaving their homes/families/lives. Having happy employees is more important than a punch clock/physical presence, especially for a virtual company. Yes, there are SOME jobs that should be physically together (the physical servers of reddit are somewhere, so theoretically someone who needs to be switch things on and off needs to be near them), but reddit functions 24/7, so having people spread across the globe/time zones would benefit the operation.

I know this isn't an AMA, but I'm curious whether you, Steve, are going to step back and evaluate all of reddit and consider making big moves that may look like going backwards, because that worked.

I also appreciate that we don't/can't know why /u/chooter was terminated, but if the rumours of her disagreeing with the changes of her role are the root cause, I would hope that you'd be open enough to consider that someone whose been in the role should be listened to for their opinions. I'm not suggesting you hire /u/chooter back, but if the reason for her termination was a disagreement with someone who has now stepped down as CEO, it would mean a lot to the users if /u/chooter was given the option to return - let her decide. If I was Victoria, I'd consider it, but I'd be wanting a firm personal employment contract that protects me from termination without severance unless I was stealing from the company or something. You pay people to be good at what they do and think/contribute, not to be drones and do what you say. If you want drones, fire everyone and outsource overseas.

Another voice seemingly lost in all of this is /u/kickme444 who brought such positive energy and commitment to the reddit userbase. Truly, the reason I created my account and stopped lurking was to be part of the first Secret Santa. If you check the age of my account, you'll see it was created within days of the first Secret Santa campaign, run out of Dan's home, for free, all to bring some joy to the world. Again, I doubt we'll know why Dan was terminated, but seeing that reddit killed the store connected to redditgifts, which presumably was a source of income, I can only guess that reddit Inc. was cutting ties with anybody who didn't agree 100% with what they were being told to do. Same as my comment above - Dan was hired and redditgifts bought from him to contribute to the community/organization/company, so if he was terminated for having opinions on what he created, reddit is the loser in the situation. Dan will have no trouble finding another job, but the chaos reddit created in his life by forcing a move and terminating him is disgraceful.

Pao just did what the reddit board wanted. She couldn't possibly have made those changes herself and have nobody disagree with it. Reddit is getting commercialized, or at least, changing how they are getting their money. And that's okay. Better communication would have been nice.

Ellen Pao stepping down now will change nothing, unless the board miraculously un-fires the people who have been let go, reinstates banned subreddits and members. However, since nothing in the announcement nor comments points to this being a possibility, it's very likely that the changes Pao took flak for will just stay there.

From a business and strategy perspective, this has been a great move, lots of people bought it and jumped on the hate bandwagon, but they completely lost track of the real thing happening here, and that's the structure of reddit being changed.

I'm not opposing this. I'm just in for the smaller subreddits which have an awesome community and a website has got to find ways to survive, and it can't just forever lean on karma and reddit gold.

Ellen Pao is just one of the problems. Advance Publications is the company that bought Reddit and makes a lot of the rules. **Sam Newhouse and the board of [Advance Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications)** are the ones who you should keep an eye on as he is in charge of things over in Advance Publications. Remember that they assign the board members who decides what happens here on Reddit and who to hire for Reddit as well. Aaron Swartz, one of the founders of Reddit, hated working for Condé Nast so much that he stopped going into work and was eventually fired. Eventually Reddit was picked up by Condé Nast's parent company Advance Publications.

Ellen was simply an interim CEO.

Suppose you are the young Reddit and you are badly in need of cash. A venture capitalist comes and offers to invest in reddit, the one condition is that you must pay the profits at the end of 10 years. There was no certainty that Reddit would turn, so the VC was taking a huge risk, not surprisingly they also make huge profits. With reddit it should be somewhere around 1000% profits.

So the VC wants the maximum return for their money at the end of the 10 year term. This means the investment must be maxed out in value and then sold. Ohanian and co. knew that would happen and when. They knew exactly as they signed the papers 10 years ago.

Reddit finally gets bought out and sold because people have hopes that they can monetize Reddit, but doing so is hard. Pao only enters the picture after everyone with a bit of sense has taken their money and bailed out. She is inconsequential. Reddit is now owned by the same company that owns Vogue and Bride magazine. You can figure out what is in their horoscope.

Pao begins converting these in Reddit to try and make things more friendly for investors, such as banning FPH among other subreddits that could be found to be offensive. But it was offensive moreover to specific groups of people, namely extreme feminists and the more family oriented types. Although many people hate to admit it, Twitter has a very large group of extremist feminists going strong that have the capability to destroy people such as nobel prize winners like [Tim Hunt](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/nobel-scientist-tim-hunt-female-scientists-cause-trouble-for-men-in-labs) for obvious jokes. It's made all the more obvious that Pao was catering to feminists by leaving /r/shitredditsays untouched for the brigading that they continue to accomplish by posting links directly to posts. If it was in the name of hate, you've got to better explain to me why /r/coontown is still here as well.

In any case, Reddit is a culture of allowing people to post and say what they want much of the time, allow any type of ideology to break that culture should be frowned upon. It's not just *radical* feminism, it's the idea of family friendly entertainment and cutting out less popular belief systems.

It makes good business sense to try and appeal to the radical feminists that seem to have so much power nowadays, and eliminating offensive subreddits also encourages those who are worried about sensitivity to actually invest. Reddit's part of a business after all, it just makes sense to try and make money in any way possible.

All you have to do is look at the trends that Advance Publications' publications are trying to set in each of the magazines and you should be able to determine where they wish to steer Reddit.

Just make sure that you don't believe that this is the final victory or anything. I'm not saying that the company is evil, only that obviously ideology can be passed down the line from company owners and it's up to people here to make sure that we don't allow things to go to shit. 

Edit: Okay, lots of words. Obligatory plz no shadowban plz. Ah, and I should clarify that calling out radical feminism isn't synonymous with misogyny in the same way that calling out radical Islamist doesn't make me a racist who hates all Arabs.

**TL;DR**: You've heard Ellen Pao is stepping down. You haven't heard that policies that were set in place while she was here are being reversed. Don't believe you've won or that things will change yet, stay vigilant and be sure that you always state what you will and won't stand for.

Due to the length/# of comments on this thread,.. I haven't had time to judiciously read down through all of them. Please forgive me if any of my comments are duplicates of what's already been said. 

And I'll also be honest in saying,.. I don't know much about you. I've been on Reddit for 6 years,.. but obviously nowhere near the time/capacity you have. I'm in no place to tell you how to do your job,.. but I wanted to give my feedback anyways. 

1.) I've said it in other threads,.. but I genuinely hope the controversies over the past couple weeks are taken as a sign to the Reddit Admins that their Userbase is deeply passionate about Reddit. You can look back through the comment-count in postings to /r/announcements and definitely see which threads are pushing 10,000+ or 20,000+ ) You guys should take that NOT as a negative, but as a positive sign,.. and brainstorm creative ways to recognize and harness that energy. No matter what problem (perceived or real) you're having -- your Users are your best resource. As long as you do right by them,.. you'll be fine. Keep it real and make it a point (yourself) to regularly engage with Users at their level. Look for ways to unexpectedly delight Reddit Users. One of the things I would do as Reddit CEO -- would be to occasionally drop-in/visit a random sub-reddit just to say ""Hi"", ask questions/contribute or just remind them how you value their contributions. Explore and Interact with little corners of Reddit you don't normally visit (and whom may not expect a visit by the Reddit CEO). I think that would be pretty awesome. 

2.) I'm disturbed and concerned about various comments made about ""increasing the # of Users on Reddit"". I sincerely hope you guys aren't trying to do a ""quantity over quality"" mistake. If you're focusing solely/specifically on ""bringing more Users to Reddit"" -- then I think that's going to be a giant fail. (or another giant controversy). Forget about User-growth,.. and simply focus on **QUALITY**. User-growth will come as a nice side-benefit as long as you simply take care/foster the great things on Reddit that already exist (things like Reddit Gift Exchange,etc). Internet forums don't become a ""destination of choice"" simply because of the # of Users. People are drawn to quality content and a quality community. 

3.) I know you (and Deimorz and others on the Admin team) have stated (and are actively working) on improving Mod Tools, refining and clarifying the Content Policy and other improvements. I think this is great (and long overdue). I hope you'll engage the overall community in every step of that process,.. and be fearless in the face of feedback. I firmly believe the Reddit community is pretty forgiving as long as you're making efforts to constantly communicate/converse with them. Lack of communication is what fuels confusion, feelings of exclusion and/or bitterness/divisiveness. I think we've all seen examples recently of that. 

I love Reddit. Not afraid or ashamed to say it. I think there are already numerous User-created/sustained ecosystems within Reddit that make Reddit great. Those became great because of genuine, natural, organic and bottom-up effort & contributions by everyone involved in them. **That's where the power of Reddit lives.**. As long as you don't lose sight of that,.. I think the potential of Reddit will continue to grow and be strong. ",False,False,False,252300,3336,1228760034.0,False,True

How delusional can you guys be? I love reddit. I sincerely do. It's exactly what I want in a website and 90% of my computer time is spent on it to some extent. But do you guys not care about us? Do you seriously think so little of us that you'd rather appear to be a 'professional' business than to just be straight with us? Death threats are not cool. But reddit has been very extremely vocal in saying, "" WE DO NOT WANT TO GO THIS DIRECTION."" "" DON'T CHANGE WHAT REDDIT IS"" And that is what Ellen was trying to do. She was trying to change reddit. I'm not trying to say she is a horrible person or even a horrible CEO. But she tried to do things her community hated, and you guys just ignore us.

And then even had the gall to say that the majority of users didn't care?

Good luck with that. You can't engineer a better society. Many have tried. We'll do what we do and you'll try to find a way to make your website look more appealing to whomever it is you're trying to impress. If you go down this road she put you on, Reddit will wither on the vine.

Ellen was a fraud, a liar, a bullshit artist. The sweeping majority of Redditors **don't make the content of Reddit happen** either. So that annoying little 1% of users and moderators are the ones you should try not to *alien*ate. (See what I did there?)

I wrote this in the past, and I will write it again and again.
The very ""rude"" tone on the internet is NOT just because we are anonymously writing.
It also exists, because people feel the need to substitute with harsh words the OTHER signs of heavy displeasure that we use in day to day life, and are used to.

One can't make an actual angry face, so people substitute that with harsher language. One can't communicate with body language, so people compensate with harsher language, and one can't communicate via infliction or volume, and all the other little things that makes our voice communicate besides just words, so people compensate with words.

The results are words, that would never be acceptable in actual in person communication, but there, it would already be coupled with the other things, and then would be ""on top"".

Which means to create the same ""range"" of expressive emotions JUST with letters as with normal talking communication means increasing the range of words.
And quite frankly people who get hurt easily do not account for this, and just take the words, and act like someone actually talked to them like that, and THEN add what they think that person would look and sound like on top (and they might very well be wrong).

The language on the web, is the result of increasing the ""volume"" until they get taken serious, to the point where it is unquestionable that they are angry. But it doesn't mean what they wrote should be taken literal, or as something that person would say face to face. And not just because they would be afraid of repercussions. Partially because doing it would be unnecessary.

The complaining of a certain type of people who seem utterly new to the web, while failing to account for fundamental differences in how this communication is limited and different is like a person just nilly willy moving to a different country, and then getting a percecution complex because everybody is angry all the time, just because they fully don't understand that this is just how the local language there sounds, and that their interpretation is biased based on THEIR language, instead of an honest representation of the local mood.
The fact that the web uses their language in writing is only a minor difference.


>Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.

And I believe an actual majority would fall very much in between. And I find the dichotomy and resulting defending of bad faith decisions very disconcerting.

It might be true that a majority didn't give 2 shits about what other people were angry about, but to me that often is also the kind of majority that is ""always"" fine with sycophantic brown nosing, until the same mode of decision making hits something that they can relatably be angry about losing.

And honestly, I find the post in it's entirety confusing, too the point that I can't determine anymore whether sacking her was JUST a placating move, and the things she had to take the brunt for will actually keep on happening, or whether this move is an actual show of replacing key personal that had a bad influence.

""[Ellen] brought focus to chaos"" - She fired a valued member of the community for no apparently-decent reason, which sparked chaotic outrage in the community.

""[Ellen] drove growth"" - It seemed like many long-time users were considering leaving the site because of her 'scorched earth' policy when it came to managing staff. I've stuck with the site largely because of the quality of the science AMAs, and she destroyed valuable relationships which upheld that when she fired Victoria.

""[Ellen] is a pioneer for women in the tech industry"" - She sued Kleiner Perkins for wrongful dismissal (allegedly caused by gender discrimination), but lost the case because the jury found that her performance at the company wasn't sufficient to warrant promotion (her role required promotion to perpetuate employment). Furthermore, she had an affair with one of the employees she accused of discrimination (he was married), so it's not exactly like the didn't aggravate the gender issue.

All of that comes across as selfish hijacking of REAL gender discrimination issues, to try and claw back a job that the company had every right to fire her from in the first place. That in turn tarnishes the reputation of equal-rights advocacy, because it perpetuates the false rebuke that women hide behind gender discrimination when they under-perform.

Obviously death threats and other personal attacks are completely inappropriate, and it's noble of Ellen to acknowledge that this doesn't represent the general Reddit community. But she was absolutely the wrong person for the job, and the community, and she HAS done damage to Reddit's reputation that may take a long time to fix (not just with users, but also with some scientists). We are very fortunate to see the back of her, and this serves as a shining example of how democracy can achieve great things when power becomes otherwise corrupted.

In fact, it's probably quite fortunate that the public reacted so vociferously to her appointment, because otherwise she might file another discrimination lawsuit (this time against Reddit), claiming that she was fired for failing to meet unreasonable goals. That might sound a bit harsh, but it's EXACTLY the same thing she accused Kleiner Perkins of doing.",False,False,1436585753.0,701,139,1411899875.0,False,False

I created an OC post back in February that made it to the top of /r/all and quite frankly it garnered attention from all over the world once it gained momentum here on Reddit.  It wasn't the kind of story that was interesting as fuck, but it was the kind of story that was uplifting as fuck.  It was just about my grandma being crowned the ""princess"" of her nursing home for Valentine's Day.  Ellen sent me a heartfelt email describing to me how the reddit staff had really embraced the story...and my grandma.  She told me how it had made everyone smile and a little happier that day.  It honestly moved me that she'd take time out to reach out to me and let me know that I'd made a difference.  Even though it was a pretty small difference in the grand scheme of things, it made me love Reddit that much more and it made me feel special in a sea of millions of people.



Alexis also reached out to me asking for my address because team Reddit wanted to send my grandmother something special. A week later I received a brand-new gold Apple iPad for my grandmother and I to Reddit on!  It was engraved on the back ""To Princess MaryAnn from your loyal subjects at Reddit"".  Reddit /r/aww is what we do when I visit her every week...she loves ""the Reddit people"".

Reddit is the greatest website and I just wanted to take the opportunity to remind people that it got this way on the backs of people like Alexis and Ellen.

And now I'm sure everyone who flocked off to Voat will come rushing back and those who ""resigned"" as mods will want their positions back. But whatever, I'll still continue to use Reddit, but the way the mods acted even when they weren't directly affected by what happened in many subs made me loose respect for such subs and how they're ran. But I'll still continue to use Reddit because it is the best site and despite the nonsense that happened the last couple weeks there are still some really great communities. 

EDIT: I also think there needs to be a more strict set of rules mods must follow especially if they moderate a large community. Some mods tried to permanently shut down their subreddits in ""protest"" with no notification to the users and kicked out the other mods in a display of just absolute power-tripping behavior. That to me is unacceptable. I think it's too easy to become a mod and too easy to abuse power as a mod. More rules and guidelines are absolutely necessary.

Part of the beauty of Reddit is that the interface is already simple enough to be used on the phone. I question what an iconographic interface adds to a largely text-based website.  I am generally annoyed that my phone will occasionally redirect to m.reddit because I really like the simple look and fast load times of text.

If there was a mobile version that was still largely text based and simply changed the sizes of links that are more tedious on mobile I would love that. But the current heavily graphic mobile interface leaves me wondering, why am I loading more assets on a platform that generally has less resources and less bandwidth?

I probably will be lurking here until it, or me, dies. We live in a reality where IF there is anonymous posting and popularity, the trolls and garbage will come. There was terrible garbage on there 7 years ago when I joined and there is now. Also some really awesome and cool things.

I think the actions reddit took for the hateful subreddits were needed and I applaud them, but I do think it is a slippery slope in context of what the community seemed to originally be about.

Maybe people who are into whatever is deemed ""perverted"" or ""sick"" by the masses should be filtered out. I feel Reddit is becoming a dulled version of itself by necessity. IMO, the dulled version is more friendly version, but maybe some of the ugliness is what made it special?

So we get rid of the blemishes on Reddit's face with some concealer... give em a nosejob to fix that crooked nose... apply an Instagram filter to make it feel more homey. Tidy up all the ugliness.

On top of that, you idiots who believe banning a subreddit dedicated to taking peoples personal photos, posting them to a board with over 100,000 subscribers without concealing their faces, and then visciouly mocking/dehumanizing them have no clue at all what ""free speech"" entitles or when and where you are entitled to it. What FPH did was the *pure definition* of harassment, you don't have to physically assault someone to harass them -- making an individual the unwilling subject to the hate and ridicule of thousands is harassment plain and simple. If you took out a commercial that was nothing but a photo album of a girl you went to highschool with labeled as a fat worthless piece of shit, that would be harassment. You can lie all you want, but the truth is that being exposed on a platform as huge as this inevitably results in unwanted attention, being harassed outside of the confines of the subreddit, messages on other sites and even being recognized in person. FPH was not a quaint niche community for people to productively criticize the obesity epidemic. Their targets were not always ""fat activists"", and many of them weren't even notably fat or were even trying to lose weight. FPH was a fucking hate mob designed to dehumanize individuals at random, and Reddit had every right to not want to be associated with it. Psychological harassment goes beyond ""hurt fee-fees"" and if something were to go down (eg. a teenager targeted by the site commits suicide) Reddit could have been liable. Your right to free speech doesn't overrule Reddit's right to moderate content being posted on the site that it doesn't feel comfortable hosting.

A tyrant manager has to have total control over everything and fires employees who have a difference in ethics or agreements instead of having a honest debate about it. Compare this with a consulting manager that empowers their employees to make their own decisions, listens to their concerns, and has an open office with transparency and good communication skills. 

When Ellen first became CEO, she had my support and respect. That was until she went on a power trip, and started to delete subreddits without warning, that was until she fired Reddit employees with no transparency one of them eve had Leukemia and another one Victory did the AMA subreddit verification.   

For the record I never issued death threats or even an insult. All I did was disagree with the ethics of each decision she made that had impacted the Reddit community. It seemed like Ellen had her own secret police that did her buddings. 

I was ready to leave Reddit for Voat and other places, I'm not so sure right now that Ellen resigned. 

I think most of the problems came from the Gamergate people who are also in the Redpill subreddit. If you want to ask me who could be behind death threats and insults.

Just remember what Ellen Pao did to get the petition signed against her, and don't do those things as the new CEO and things should go back to normal.

The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world. People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

I have to say this, I'm sorry. I don't agree with the hate people spewed at Ellen and I do agree with all you've said about compassion and remembering our humanity -but... I want you to remember that how you and Ellen feel when you see that hateful, cruel behavior is *precisely how people feel when they see reddit providing a safe platform for racism and hatred in subs like coontown.* Now, to dish out a bit of tough love, if you expect us all to lump that, then you need to as well. I'm sorry it was upsetting to Ellen but then I haven't noticed much concern for *other* ""fellow humans"" that get to be the target of far greater hate than Ellen had to deal with for a long weekend. If you want to make us all remember that people have human feelings and that we should be mindful of not allowing hate to rule us, you can start by refusing to be a platform for hate speech. Or, if not, be sure not to admonish us again when some gets directed your way. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

I know too well the importance of free speech, but I also know that while someone has the freedom to say something, I also have the freedom not to host them in my home or business. You may be free to spew hate about Jews and love for nazis, but McDonalds isn't forced to allow them to use the dining room to make speeches and hand out pamphlets.

Again, I do condemn what people said about Ellen but I also condemn the various racist subs on reddit. Free speech is a two-way street -if we must tolerate hate, then we *all* must -Ellen included. If we want to grow to be above that, then we must apply those morals evenly.

Under US law there are actually several classes of threats which are still protected under the first amendment such as threatening politically motivated boycotts, threatening social ostracism and any threats which a reasonable person would understand as hyperbole.  Many threats, including hyperbolic death threats are in fact covered under free speech.  It is not at all clear to me how you've determined that the threats you are banning people for do not constitute free speech nor how you would have the legal authority to decide that.

Reddit is a company not a court and the fact that you can ban users for things they say has everything to do with the private agreements we signed to post on this site and nothing to do with constitutional free speech.

Today we, as a community, have allowed that to happen and have allowed progress to regress. Ellen Pao, in all honesty, I learned mostly about you through the deleterious and hateful speech of a very vocal group here. It is unfortunate that the staff and administrators did not condemn such speech but also encouraged it. What you stood for and tried to do will be remembered. The true reasons why you were pressured to leave will also resonate in our memories.

It is a sad day when an administrator of CoonTown is gilded and upvoted into the hundreds in the very same thread that the new Reddit CEO, Steve Huffman, has announced his return. The parallelism between the two have set an unprecedented domino effect; the tolerance that Reddit was once working towards is now crumbling before us. Those who hate are not punished, but they are celebrated. Groups who hate others solely on the color of their skin are not persecuted; they are celebrated in the same breath as the return of a CEO.

While I'm happy to see old management return, the decision to get rid of FPH and other similar subreddits was a mature and compassionate one and should be upheld. Please stay true to your word about balancing authenticity with empathy as you draft your content standards. Reddit's open community should not be one where we allow hate, harassment, and ignorance to thrive and as a result, spread, in the exploited name of freedom. Freedom of speech doesn't exist in a binary state of ""all or nothing"". We should use critical thinking and social skills to determine what content shouldn't be encouraged. There is no socially responsible justification for reddit to earn money from content like FPH, creep shots, child porn, overt racism, and more. Hate spreads like cancer when left unchecked, as we can see when racism and homophobia is passed on from generation to generation in ignorant communities. Yes, it's more work and yes, it requires more vigilance to avoid the slippery slope into censorship, but I think it's worth it to make the effort. Many young, intelligent, creative minds gravitate to reddit and as such, reddit can help guide the next generation into balancing freedom of speech with respect and compassion.

Like most of reddit, I'm happy to see this change in management. I just hope that you will show the fortitude necessary to develop a strong community that balances ""authenticity with compassion"" to use your own excellent choice of words.

I'll just hold my breath and see how many times Steve is referred to as Chairman Huffman, not only in the future, but in this thread alone. Oh, what's that? Nobody is doing that?

This is a start, but it's not quite the right direction. We need clear *rules*. The current [rules](https://www.reddit.com/rules/) are vague in a cutesy sense that worked fine in a smaller, self-regulated community. They're not good enough for a large, centrally administered site with serious problems on both ends: abusive users and abusive moderation/administration.

We shouldn't *ever* hear about inexplicable shadowbanning except in the commercial spam contexts for which shadowbans were designed. Users should be subject to fair processes, with fair notice and clear resolution according to published rules. (This should apply to subreddit rules as well, but that's not the subject of this thread.)

For example, as a user I'd like to have it clearly explained when I can and cannot comment and vote in threads. Should I refrain from doing so in /r/TwoXChromosomes because I'm male? Does the fact that I followed a cross-subreddit link to get to the thread change that? What about a link from offsite? Does it matter whether or not I subscribe? Is this question subject to the subreddit rules, or to sitewide Reddit rules, or both? If the subreddit matters, should the mods be able to track where I came from?

The internet is a communication tool, a way for us to talk and that is something we must cherish in the most basic sense of what it means... we are the world and we are talking, instantly, to one another, through Reddit. We are using pictures, gif, video, audio, meme and just any way we can think of to talk to one another.


What this also means is that all of humanity is contained here, our best and worst, unfiltered and REAL. That is what we love, the reality of it all. We don't want to be told how to communicate, we want to be unfiltered and able to speak our minds to one another.

This website has given the world a platform to discuss anything, from cats to silly stories to our favorite tv and movie moments, it has it all.

What I believe we fear most is losing the ability to freely express ourselves and I mean express ourselves; the best and worst of who and what we are. What are we? Animals. Creatures that live on this planet, we are flawed and we are weak and beautiful at the same time.

We make mistakes, we cheat, lie, steal, kill, laugh, love, giggle and most importantly  we express ourselves and JUDGE the world around us.


We want to be left to freely chat and say things that offend or bring love or all feelings in between.

I think it is important to realize what this has been all about, it is about the freedom to not be governed by a corporation but have the liberty to speak as a community of humanity.


I suppose the roots of what reddit is needs to be underlined in the next few months and to just leave it alone, allow it to grow and to become what ever it is to become on it's own.

As the world has no peace there will be no peace on reddit, it is ok, don't try too hard to moderate the natural way of the world. We can slowly make changes to ideas and to talk to one another but the problems reddit faces are the problems the world faces; we must grow together as a world divided and never forget that we are all animals here, clicking away on the internet..sometimes we are mean to one another, that is ok, sometimes we hate one another... that is ok, sometimes we are just truly nasty individuals, that is ok... this is what you wanted, the world all in one place... and guess what?

The world has it all.

However, on a serious note, can some long-term Redditors pipe up with some comments about Steve?  In particular, back in the day was he better at interacting with us?  By ""us"" I mean both mods and the full community here.  Are there any good interactions we can look back upon?

Also, this:

> If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion

...sounds good if we're talking about the context of people not posting death threats.  I get that.  I ran a Web forum for a few years and had a user who eventually told me he intended to kill my wife and kids.  I just ""noped"" out.  I'm not down for that level of incivility or violence (implied, threatened, or realized).  No job is worth that shit.

However, IF that sentence in any way suggests that Steve has ""drunk the Kool-Aid"" in regards to prettying up Reddit, making everything PC and ""safe,"" and barring offensive comments, then I am really disappointed in this development.  I don't want to swap out one ""you better only say nice things"" CEO for another.  I want assholes to have free speech just as much as I want a wonderful saint of a person to have free speech.  That's the entire *point* of free speech -- it's a concept that needs enforcing *because* it can get uncomfortable sometimes.  For example, dealing with Ellen I feel required a lot of really hard-line talking (obviously not to the point of death threats, but certainly some very blunt ""you are an awful CEO"" opinions needed to be aired), and I don't think we would have ousted Ellen if everyone was meek and compassionate.

And yes, I get it that Reddit is a private company and free speech is not really a ""thing"" for companies.  I'm suggesting that in the context of a forum like Reddit, we should strive to get at close as possible anyway.  We should even allow ourselves to feel discomfort.  We should see objectionable speech, grit our teeth, and say, ""That's awful, and I'm going to say it's awful, but I'm not going to ban it or insist that the only things allowed are those which hit a proper level of compassion.""  At the very least, if there IS going to be some kind of banning/censorship, I'd really like it to be down at the moderator level.

Sounds good :)

> A few other points. Mods, you are what makes reddit great. The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you. You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.

These are empty promises for now, but I trust that reddit will deliver.

> Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be. The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Uh-oh, this implies that changes are going to be made on reddit soon, this stuff has been talked about before. Hopefully there won't be unpopular changes... again!

> Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile. I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.

Really? That's the best the entire combined pool of Reddit tech-team, P.R. and human resources could come up with in order to make this whole debacle finally go away?

I swear this happens every single time a SJW gets in trouble to a point where their attempts to bring forth their skewed notions of ""justice"" (which is really just a code-word for censorship on the internet these days) has alienated every one so badly that even their allies feel compelled to intervene.

It's either death threats or rape threats or both.

As soon as those things are even hinted at, no matter how little factual basis they have in reality, and who would check, they're home free.

Because, clearly, the issue was with threats or misogyny, not the poor performance of a CEO, who happens to be a woman (which no one gave a fuck about in the first place) and incompetent (this, people care about).

Let alone their history of frivolous lawsuits and ponzy schemes.

Ah, so you agree with Ellen that reddit need not be a free speech platform?

> If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community

Reddit is not a failure as a community because portions of it sometimes support negative ideas.  That's like saying the human race is not great because of nazi Germany.

Those ideas are sickening, yes.  Surprising?  No..  The internet has always been this way.  Heck, if you think about it, real life is this way too.  People say mean things about other people when they're not around.  Should individuals be censored or punished for that?  I don't think so, and neither does the US constitution.

Of course, Reddit can do as it pleases.  But trying to censor every disparaging remark is not practical for your team.  Even if you get the (mod) community on board, it is pretty tough to find the right place to draw the line.  You've already seen the community demanding clearer definitions over what justifies a shadow ban, etc.  I expect we will see more of that even after Ellen's departure: it's just a hard problem, and in my opinion, one not worth tackling.  You can focus on cracking down on the negativity, or you can focus on supporting the positive aspects (reddit gifts / secret santa, keeping people like Victoria, not firing people who have cancer..) and trust that the negativity will be drowned out.  It was before and it can be again!  Think positive and this will be a positive place.

I understand that you, /u/kn0thing , /u/spez , and others do not work on this website in order to provide a platform for negativity.  But let's not argue that negativity is the prevailing attitude.  It's only prevailing for you because Reddit Inc is a bigger part of your world than it is ours.

Compassion for people who associate with scumbags like Fletcher.  Compassion for scumbags that think ""safe space"" is compatible with free speech.  Compassion for scumbags that actively try to destroy the values that make Reddit great.

No, there is no compassion for someone that violent.  Absolutely not.  That some minority of people you claim exist find that level of violence worthy of a death threat should not be a surprise, even if it is unwarranted.

Today, everyone is offended over everything. You can't call someone a faggot without being labeled a homophobe, you can't describe someone as black without being a racist, and you can't have factual debates outside the echo box without being labeled closed minded (ironically) or a troll. 

If reddit straddles the fence on this issue as it has been doing, then we're left with the front page of facebook/digg/buzz feed.

SO if you don't backtrack and reverse policy on this whole ""safe spaces"" crap that only panders to the people who want to treat the internet like some sort of kiddie preschool nonsense you'll basically be telling everyone who actually cares about this site that you don't care about the core values that made us flock to this site in the first place.

Just so we're all clear on this, you users who came in the last two years have more or less ruined reddit. You came for the dank memes and got offended by the (for lack of a better phrase) hacker culture phenomenon that was taking place here so you started movements to try and change that. Reddit was always supposed to be 4chan Lite, not Facebook with better organization, yet that's what you all seem to be pushing for because you're too damned lazy to hit unsubscribe and too addicted to the feeling of being offended to ignore content you find objectionable. The rest of us, the users who built reddit into the media juggernaut it is today, the ones who provided the content and the discussions and controlled the flow of information and changed the national dialogue in many cases, we all came here because reddit represented free speech. Now at least one of you is going to pull the whole ""Uh hurr durr but reddit is a private company and they don't have to allow free speech"" like I'm some kind of idiot who doesn't know that. Listen to me, don't mouth off: reddit was built on the idea of free speech, it promised free speech, and up until recently it actually offered free speech (minus /r/jailbait which is understandable even if in a perfect free speech world it would be allowed with heavy moderation), so for the admins to start shutting down subreddits they find morally objectionable is OBSCENE.

Reddit, don't you ever forget who made this site what it is, don't you ever forget that we hold the keys to your profits, and don't you ever forget that you're a goddamn fluke in a sea of alternatives just WAITING for you to screw up one more time so they can attract all the users who actually care enough to take care of a community when it upholds values consistently. We OWN you, and tell the investors they can suck a fat one if they think they're going to monetize this site the same way they would every other site. This community is too damned important to give up like that, but if you sell us out we'll leave you high and dry up shit creek without a paddle.

Obviouly, you were a co-founder of Reddit, and have ideas and inside knowledge for where this site needs to go moving forward. Also, its clear that you will do so within the confines of the board. With all of that said, please allow me to offer a few of my wishes as Reddit moves forward. 

Warning: Wall of Text



**1. Mod Tools**

It looks like you are already on top of this, and have promised to work on this. I ask that by promising mod tools, you also promise a time frame and stick to it. 

Unfortunately, many users are already concerned that the current promise for mod tools made last week is not going to happen. This is due to one of the admins saying that they will not meet the ""by the end of 2015"" timeline. 

**2. Open Communication to all of Reddit**

Not just the mods, please. Please allow us to input our ideas, and respect what we all have to say. It should be clear that the collective voice of the userbase is strong. 

I speak for the rest of us, when I say that we want to be kept in the loop. Being blindsided by the decisions made last week had a huge effect on us, and a large number of users have left because of the lack of communication/input.

**3. Restore the great parts of Reddit while progressing forward.**

As co-founder, you created this site with a central purpose in mind. Consensus seems to indicate that we have gotten away from that purpose. The first thing that comes to mind is censoring Reddit to become more ""business friendly"" (cough /r/FatPeopleHate cough).

It's okay to move an organization forward, and to make changes, as long as the changes don't deviate from the original purpose. [The core values](https://www.reddit.com/about/values/) seems like a great litmus test when making decisions moving forward. Just remember, that while looking forward, please look back to your first time as CEO and see what positive things from that time are missing, and reinstate them.

**4. Consider bring back those individuals adored by the userbase**

There may be valid reasons as to why people like Victoria and Dan were let go, and we legally cannot know why. However, if possible, extending an open hand to bring them back into the fold will be a huge step forward for Reddit. 

It's clear that we love what Victoria did for /r/IAmA and other subs, and we love what Dan did for RedditGifts. Bringing them back would restore a lot of trust and confidence for us.

**5. Be Awesome**

Self-explanatory.

--------------------
There are many other things that the userbase wants. I hope these are a few overarching themes that encompass your leadership vision moving forward.

The users of Reddit (for the most part) will be behind you as we move forward. However, we will also be vocal when things on that we don't like!

&gt; If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.

Reddit gets it's userbase from the world, and the world is still not a great community overall. It's full of all kinds of people, some are the nicest that will give all they have to help a complete stranger, and others are sociopaths that enjoy ripping others off and being a bully.

As long as that is true, and Reddit is a website open to the public, it'll never be a community that's any better or worse than any other. [[Continued...]](http://www.resavr.com/comment/an-old-team-reddit-1458935)

She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth. She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry. She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015. I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.

Shame you morons couldn't provide a gracious exit announcement for Victoria.  I'd like to think you're starting to learn some basic business skills, but I'm more inclined to believe that you're just terrified of being sued.

This is utter garbage.  If you don't have thick skin than you have absolutely no business being in a position with so much authority.

That being said, I think that this is a fantastic example of what a united community can accomplish. The community of reddit decided what they wanted to happen, the leaders of the community did what they could to make us heard, and we won. 

 But we as a community need to realise what we never know the whole story. We made a big mistake with out investigation of the Boston Bomber, which could have had much worse reprecusion than it did. While I did not like what Ellen had to say, I think that whenever reddit demonizes someone or something, it has a tendency to view anything associated with that thing as just as bad. (One moderator is bad, thus all mods are bad)

I hop over to Reddit now and then only to find out what's going on in the world and what snarky assholes like me have to say about it. I'm gonna repeat that last part cuz it's very important. AND WHAT SNARKY ASSHOLES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT! 

I love snarky assholes like me. That's what I want Reddit to be about. The world at large and what snarky assholes have to say about it. I don't come in here for drama about the people behind the scenes. Frankly, before this mess, I'm not even sure if I knew there was a behind the scenes at Reddit. This is a totally foreign concept to me. I guess I just imagined this whole crazy thing was all on one magical server in some rich kid's garage, nestled between the dryer and his dad's old golf buggy, attached clandestinely to a T-1 line at a nearby corporate behemoth the same way his dad steals cable. 

People actually make money at this? How? When you're all so busy firing each other and annoying the mods and drowning kittens? Cut the soap opera crap! If I wanted soap operas I'd watch All My Children! Stop doing stuff that makes people wanna make a statement by shutting down beloved subreddits! I didn't even know people could do that! There oughtta be a law, etc etc. Keeping me from seeing what snarky assholes like me have to say about shit in the world going on outside Reddit is unacceptable behavior! Nothing is more important than snarky assholes! NOTHING! If there is anything more important than the egos of my fellow snarky Reddit assholes, we want it caught and shot and taxidermied and propped up in an Elk Lodge where my fellow snarky assholes can go and get drunk and point at it and laugh. Cain't we all just git along!? No!? Well, get off my lawn, then! The Great Poobah Hath Spokeneth! WHERE'S MY TASSLED FEZ!? I WAS PROMISED A TASSLED FEZ!

I really don't have much of an opinion of Pao either way, and I've seen both legitimate criticism of her as well as hyperbolic and disturbing rhetoric.

Barring any further explanation, it seems as though she left due to the overwhelming hate she's received from Reddit's users, and if that's the case, I think the implications of that are far-reaching and fascinating.

Where was the authenticity of Pao when firing Victoria? This is a case of bullying worse than I have seen anywhere. Pao chose to fire a woman with a family and mouths to feed, a hard worker and somebody that put themselves ahead with the community.

Reddit has a mandate from its owners to monetize.

It is not clear that *any* metaforum like reddit can be successfully monetized. It might be unavoidable ruin... but reddit is nevertheless under orders to march in that direction. So off we go.

This new CEO is good at PR but no matter how nice he is, he can't change his marching orders. He is ordered to monetize, he is ordered to make reddit attractive to sponsors (i.e. he is ordered to silence the offensive stuff), he is ordered to find a way to bring in revenue.

1)  While we still can't comment on personnel decisions, it's important for me to get to know the team in place and their strengths before we can figure out the best ways to make it better.

2)  Zero for two! I can't really comment on this either.  After nearly half a day as CEO, I definitely don't presume to know the best way to utilize our resources yet.  However, I can say that the changes I'm passionate about won't be free, but they're important to making this community even more accessible and enjoyable.

3)  I'm sure it's a factor.  Any significant changes to a business structure will create the need for adjustments and reevaluations.  But even some of the most painful growth periods can create an even better community in the end.  I look forward to figuring out how best the community will benefit from the increased resources we have at our disposal.

4)  Absolutely not.  It would be a sad day for the Reddit community to settle for anything less than incredible.  I think it's healthy for people to try and find the most fruitful community they can.  However, there's a reason we're all still here; the users haven't given up on Reddit, you all know what this community can be, and you've shown that you have faith that it will get even better.  It's MY job not to let you down!

5)  It's healthy for us to worry a little because it drives us to continually improve.  If we thought that we were invincible, we would lose sight of the users that make this community great.  I know how much this community relies on its users and we have some pretty amazing users, so I'm not losing too much sleep!

6)  The biggest flaw in any dying business is their inability or unwillingness to listen to their biggest stakeholders.  In the case of Reddit, that is YOU.  If the admins fail to listen to the needs and wants of the community, we would follow digg to the grave.  This community is built on the users and we'll flourish as long as we don't forget that.

This is very well possible. But it did backfire to some significant extent by alienating everyone not from Pao but from reddit itself. 

> continuo Pao's mission to make this a safe place

The safe place policy as vaguely stated is self-contradictory, so it can only be inconsistently enforced. They promise to make it more explicit. A consistently enforced content policy both has to deviate from that platonic standard of ""safe places"" and be permeable to criticism and pseudo-lawyering, two things that had become impossible under the adhocracy of post-SRS reddit.

What's bad about ""SJW"" isn't the words S, J and W, it's that they can't be called to account for themselves, as calls for fairness are dismissable as ""false symmetry"". A fixed, external policy to work with/against, even if designed with the values of the ""reddit left"" (which isn't exactly coincident with the wider political left) at heart, is a push back to the more ""meta"" values of the reddit I used to enjoy circa 2007-2010.

That's the thing here. The way some people are celebrating Ellen Pao stepping down is as if they were celebrating what happened to a certain character at a certain Wedding of Purple color in Game of Thrones. Thing is, even after what happened, King's Landing was still screwed up and the people in power were still not the best at running the kingdom. 

Ellen deserves criticism for some of the unpopular things she did and for what she allowed to happen. She doesn't deserve some of the toxic, misogynistic, and other ridiculous comments made to bash her. Reddit's issue with communicating with us as moderators and giving us the tools to curate our communities isn't just an Ellen problem, it's a Reddit problem. Reddit's problem with inconsistent tolerance of what could be considered hate/racism/harassment is not Pao's fault, it's Reddit's fault. The CEO is the head of the company but the company runs on more than just one person.

I do hope Steve and the rest of the admins and folks at Reddit take a real aggressive stance on dealing with the issues we have with the company in the coming months, and wish /u/spez all the luck in the world.

Otherwise, prediction:

We can not deal with the influx of AMAs due to the lack of structure. In order to fix this, only people deemed famous enough by us will be given the chance to conduct an AMA on the official sub under controlled rules as to not overload our over-extended moderation team. The people will be helped by their own PR rather than our employee. This will reduce the strain on our volunteer team and create higher quality content for the sub and reduce the chance of public hate speech which is against our set guidelines.

For example, sure, I see a slight problem in closing down subreddits because of objectionable material; but my contention isn't with closing down subreddits itself as much as it is with the decision-making process that is involved in how they're closed down. Where people were screaming, ""FREE SPEECH"", I was wondering how we could make decisions on which subreddits to close down and how we could close them down in the most consistent and civilized manner (because, certainly, there are some subreddits that just don't deserve a place anywhere). I understand that we can't expect to go through life never seeing something personally objectionable, but I don't think that's an argument against working towards a more wholesome and positive community.

That being said, I hope that this event serves as a reminder to keep the community at Reddit (or at any other website driven by its users) involved and in-the-loop; ignoring the general community's discontent is always going to be a poor policy when traffic is driven by the quality of that same community's input.",False,False,1436564960.0,7400,1742,1257414864.0,False,False

Reddit uses AWS datacentres located in Northern Virginia, U.S.   The datacentres are fully maintained by AWS and all involvement from Reddit staff is remote.

Nothing like that happened.  They fired Victoria thinking that nothing much was going to happen, then everyone took off for the long weekend while things spun out of control.  Hopefully, Reddit will start looking ahead and down the road before making decisions.  You always have to be looking at the ""what next"" scenario so you don't get blindsided.

Newhouse focused on purchasing bargain-priced papers in growing communities; he had no interest in starting papers or in unrelated ventures (he even declined an offer to purchase the New York Yankees). Typically, he would acquire a city's oldest newspaper and then purchase the city's second newspaper thereby allowing him to set advertising rates. Although he would generally promise to keep both papers in business and in competition, he typically would merge the two (which generally meant closing the afternoon paper and keeping the morning) effectively establishing a monopoly and then using the profits to purchase additional newspapers.[3]

Newhouse largely ran his various interests out of a brown leather briefcase and kept its figures in his head, even as they grew into an empire of 20 newspapers, as well as numerous magazines, radio stations and television stations.

Lol, only people get hurt feelings and you're not talking to people. You're talking to money machines. And you are actually wrong. You, the community, are not important. What you are is a means to an end. And that end is money. 

No one cares what the community wants from Reddit except the community and least of all the people who run Reddit, at least not for the sake of the community. Any decision they make in the pretense of trying to please the community is only to please the community in such a way that will be favorable to opportunities for them to make money.

If the people running Reddit had a fast track, no risk plan to turn Reddit into something that made tons of money efficiently and completely removed the community as a factor, you can bet that that's what would happen. Because the community is unpredictable, thus a flawed asset. Of course, this is over simplifying: the community and the traffic it generates is probably Reddit's largest asset, but you get the idea.

At any rate, this is why anyone who has ever believed Reddit to be a ""bastion of free speech"" was an idiot. Possibly myself included. When you have powers who are either only interested in more power, more money or both, or even have any interest besides their ideals, the ideals will always be fallible. In this case: free speech on reddit? You're kidding yourself.

Content producers/curators are what bring people to the site, the variety and freedom of content and discussion is what keeps them here.

If a farmer built a tractor, maintained the tractor and I used it to plough the fields, am I not owed *anything* for my work? 

What has happened is akin to the farmer abandoning the farm, leaving you and the tractor behind to do it yourself. If the tractor breaks down (Inadequate mod tools), you're left to sort out the problem yourself.

So some resentment within the producers is brewing, and the FPH ban comes and riles up the users. Suddenly, what content is seen as going too far is being questioned by both users and producers. A serious issue for site that wants ""Open and honest discussion"" and freedom of speech bandwagons take it from there.

Then they fire an admin. An important one, one that has facilitated some of the most highly trafficked threads in this sites history and a lynch pin for the mod community of top subreddits. With no explanation why. Whether you like it or not that's a legitimate powder keg.

Pedophiles (Jailbait), racists (Stormfront), Nazi-apologists and defenders (conspiracy), and playing cop and accusing an innocent man of the Boston Bombings are pretty much the first things associated with Reddit. That's why the #1 reason people won't recommend reddit is that they don't want to expose them to the overall terrible quality of the userbase. Ellen Pao has done three major things in her tenure here: Not tolerate hate speech, not tolerate systematic and provable cyber and physical harrassment by the users, and not put communicating with mostly mediocre volunteers at the top of her list.

Reddit had been a pretty strident supporter of free-speech/community-driven moderation (basically the idea of a free market of ideas with up/downvotes as the currency) prior to the rule changes that pushed the site in a more ""safe space"" direction. I know that there was the whole banning jailbait ""scandal"" and removing creepshots, but I don't think there are many of us who were bothered by that.

It's the stuff in the background that worried me. A lot of articles concerning the former interim CEO's husband's fraudulent activities have been censored, among other examples. The /r/paoiskillingreddit sub was deleted. I don't think there are any excuses for this. Like it or not, the former CEO and her husband are public figures and are therefore fair game for criticism, whether they're connected to the site or not. Hate speech and threats are not acceptable, but there are certainly very legitimate criticisms that can be levied at them both.

Same with the Jesse Jackson AMA. The user who was banned asked a legitimate question. It was phrased rather aggressively (I personally disagree with his point of view), but he didn't make any threats, he offered a view that is shared by many people about the man. He was shadowbanned for this. Again, public figures are open to criticism. If you want to use your fame to further a cause, or use the bully pulpit in some way, you have to take the good and the bad. You can't try and affect change and then cry foul when other people decide to oppose you, and you can't expect to be treated in the same way as a private citizen when you're trying to leverage your power to change things, for better or worse.

You say that as though it's a minor change. It's not, it's a constitutional change. One of reddit's major draws is that (short of actual lawbreaking) you can communicate anything you like here, and it will get judged on its merits by the community. It's a true meritocracy, and injecting some nebulous PC standard into it is a mistake that chills speech and dilutes the value of everything said here.

So although I've had my misgivings about whether Pao was ever the right person to act as CEO based on her dubious professional, personal, and legal history, until she made the decision changing the fundamental rules of how this site worked there wasn't anything I felt she had done here that would count as actual mis-governance of the site.

Does /u/spez have the authority to make changes?

The other thing I think about with the SF moves is that by forcing everyone to be together, reddit had to have an office space physically large enough to hold them all, as well as all the costs associated with that.

I remember reading updates years back when the site was struggling to stay up that Amazon was involved, but I didn't understand how. I remember years before that when admins were posting about purchasing new servers and posting photos of them. That would be part of the progress of reddit that was a positive step, I'm guessing.

If there are no reddit-owned physically accessible servers, I would think that reddit would schedule their staff on a 24/7 multi-shift schedule so that there's always someone on the clock at the physical SF office to be able to keep things in check while working on ongoing projects. Why you wouldn't want someone living in a time zone across the planet to take the SF 'night shift' is beyond me, though. Imagine if reddit could function 24/7 where all of the shifts are working traditional work hours. I've worked shift work before - it sucks but for being able to grocery shop when everybody else is at work.

I wonder if the Board members were also required to live in SF. Having so many people live and work in the same physical space really is removing unique perspectives from a platform that needs to think global.

The logical setup to me is that everyone goes home-based and is assigned a shift where there are team leaders and project leaders. I can see SF signing off their shift while the Central European team kicks in, or maybe the EU team also contains people who live in SF who prefer to work nights. Hire for the knowledge needed and shifts, not for the geography.

I'm still confused as to why Alexis, the Chair of the Board would personally be terminating any employee other than the CEO.

If you want proof of that take a look at the recent Bethesda / Steam Payed Skyrim Mods scandal.

But two things factor in heavily.
People who are ""boss"" often forget that a lot of the communication they are involved in is not representative, because they tend to forget that a lot of it is coloured in hierarchy games. Something that really happens less on the internet. Unless we know that you are ""that star"" that we really love, you will be talked to like you are the nobody everybody else is, and not someone with power over us.
So from the perspective of their norms, the internet treats them like shit. But it just often means people just don't compensate out of fear.

And secondly, it has been mentioned several times that this was about user-base growth, and instead of going the route to attract new people by telling them why THIS way is exactly great, so maybe they should give it a go and assimilate, the business decision is to bork up what is already working in it's own way, till it is something entirely else that is attractive to new audiences, while hoping that the existing userbase won't mind too much and jump ship in equal (or god forbid higher) numbers.

So in that case it is not that the decision maker doesn't understand, it's that they ignore it, because the people they want to attract don't. At the cost of people who like it that way. It happens with gadgetry too. You get an update, which removes a feature that YOU really liked, because market research told them that it was confusing.

You mean horrifically monetise the hell out of it while they can to make as much as possible as quickly as possible before it's inevitable demise right?

Let's be realistic, if they're anything like traditional investors then when they ""give up"" on reddit the fallout will be very, very visible. They won't just switch it off, the effect would be nuclear.

I don't actually know who invests in reddit though. I do know reddit has some sort of stake in imgur, I don't know who reddit's stakeholders are though these days. Transparency actually seems lower on that front than back when we could all just say ""Advance Publications"".

I could be wrong and that could be readily available though, I've never looked. But it raises an interesting thought - the more complex things get the more opaque things are perceived by an audience.

I wonder if that's why the extreme simplicity of Valve's business, ""investors"" and hierarchy works so well for their public image.

People relate to and like small, simple things. People get uncomfortable with large, unruly, complex things that they don't understand and can not have a relationship with.

Simple things is probably the right path forwards. Short, simple, honest relationships and honest business practices. Not that they haven't tried to do that anyway, but it's not about what they try to do, it's about what they're perceived as, and the community hasn't perceived the lessening of communication and participation of the admins as an honest relationship for a number of years now.",False,False,False,109269,5749,1283044588.0,False,True

Freedom of speech never meant to protect things like child pornography, doxxing and such, it meant to protect sharing of ideas, discussions and opinions.

As for doxxing on reddit, the rules were always clear that posting any personal information, starting witch hunts and similar were a serious offence and everybody doing it would be banned.

Stop right there. This is a perfect example of how most people have an inappropriately romanticized view of reddit. This isn't some revolutionary project, for the people, by the people. You and I aren't customers: we're the product, except we have expressly agreed to receive nothing for our economic value to reddit. Truly, reddit's business model is no different than Facebook's or Google's, with the slight difference that reddit cares slightly more about your privacy.

I've had gold for a month, a constantly updating adblock app since I started, and using a mobile app for about 6 months, but I remember a point where there was a different sponsored link at the top of the front page every time I came here.

You are not the customer, you are the product. 

For simplicity, I will assume that everything presented by reddit is true.

Reddit can barely cover server costs consistently via gold purchases^[1] . It is inconceivable that as a corporation it could make enough money to stay afloat by the userbase alone. They need to cover not just server time but salaries, unless the admins are literally browsing reddit while doing their paying day jobs. 

Facebook monetizes in a number of ways, one of which is by being an authorization token for external sources. They collect personal information, so users who sign up for a website 'via facebook' have a measure of tracability that email signups do not. Facebook is built from the ground up to collect that kind of data. I'm sure it could be done, but it would be an immense programming project to collect that kind of heuristic data through Reddit, so selling that via user-directed marketing is not, to my mind, as valuable a product from reddit as it is from Facebook.

But what reddit does have is ad space for communities. Every community neatly self-sorts into pages with billboard space for sale. That's valuable in direct proportion to the number of users who don't know about Adblock, which only decreases over time without a steady influx of new users. 

The other thing reddit has is (and this is a tired old canard by now) a direct PR channel, by way of the Ask me Anything format. You are likely aware of the hypothesis surrounding the monetization of that platform vis-a-vis Victoria's departure, so I will not go into it other than to say that I have not, and likely nobody *will* see it confirmed unless it actually happens. But the theory has a certain appeal because it's one of the few channels reddit has to glean income already built into the system. This too, however, is only valuable in direct proportion to the number of users on the platform.

Finally, as users increase, server load increases. I assume after ten years that the percentage of users who are going to buy gold will remain relatively stable, barring momentary disruptions such as promotions, protests, and so on. If reddit can't keep the lights on based on current purchases without a lateral income stream, it never will.

Is it possible for you to be able to form a community of representatives from the larger moderation community of the larger moderated subs (let's say - 50,000 or more subscribers) to all debate and for you to bounce policy ideas off of, and for them to communicate their community's policies directly with you? **Even if this super-representative community cannot make policy, it's an excellent idea to consult them and gauge their reaction before making a huge costly decision.**

I've heard (not used it, as I've yet to hear a good thing said) that you can't even pause ads from running (without having to PM an admin), which is a necessity.

I understand that Reddit is a big site, and you perhaps want to avoid the huge workload of a bunch of ad submissions. But at this stage, having a working ad system with basic features like ad pausing, limited to only a few subs, would be much more appreciated by advertisers than trying to manage ads across the whole of Reddit manually.

Advertisers love it, the limited nature of the subs creates initial competition, and you're allowed time to scale the ad review time as slowly or as quickly as you want.

I realise the idea of advertising may not be popular on here. But Reddit needs a way to survive, and give me some sidebar ads over branded AMAs any day.",False,False,1436570022.0,14,1,1421311381.0,False,False

Second shadowbans need to be eliminated. Either come out and explain the actions of a ban, or don't ban.

>A __contrarian__ is a person who takes up a contrary position, especially a position that is opposed to that of the majority, regardless of how unpopular it may be.  It is similar to [iconoclasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconoclasm); attacking or openly rejecting cherished beliefs and institutions or established values and practices, but unlike the contrarian, the motive is not simply to be contrary or a tool to incite discussion. Contrarian styles of argument and disagreement have historically been associated with [radicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalism_(historical\)) and [dissent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissent).

Black held that a statement is not a criminally punishable threat unless it was made ""*with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death*."" The Court's focus was not on the possibility that the threat would actually be carried out, but on whether the target of the threat would be reasonably put in fear of attack.

It's hard to pin specifics on her, not having access to what goes on behind the scenes at reddit, but I can say that I've seen an increasing amount of chatter about killing off some of the offensive speech around reddit, and that was well before it was outright stated that they wanted reddit to be a ""safe space"". Ellen said she didn't want reddit to be a free-speech platform, but plenty of people on reddit feel that it should be. That concerned a lot of people who were worried that their ability to speak freely on this site may be under attack and several people questioned if reddit's motivation for cleaning up the site was to make it attractive to advertisers or buyers. 

Justified or not, the banning of FPH with less than clear evidence of wrong doing by the mod team fueled a lot of those concerns. Even the firing of Victoria has been rumored to have been over a dispute about adverting/PR. 

Maybe it was all just a huge circlejerk that Pao was ""changing reddit"", but there were signs that reddit was in fact changing for whatever reason and there was very little reassurance that the people running Reddit value keeping the platform a place for free and open discussion and that they weren't about to sellout the community or sacrifice some of what makes reddit special in order to court advertisers. 

Edit: it's probably worth mentioning that her shady history and associations didn't help with her rep around here either. She didn't understand the website, or it's users, who were suspicious of her and her motivations. As people's concerns about her grew she failed completely to calm the users down. Seems like this wasn't a good fit for her no matter how you look at it.

Pao brought a new wave of censorship to reddit. Claiming issues with harassment and 'brigading' that were never issues before.

She censored things that hit her personal buttons; anything that regularly attacked women, like FPH. But had no problem with subs that regularly attacked men, like all the racist subs.

Look into the supposed harassment and doxxing of imgur employees, you won't find anything specific about them

Suddenly anytime something got a lot of attention that didn't fit her teams point of view there were issues of brigading, which is what reddit is for. She tried to turn reddit away from the community that would instantly bring huge attention to government secrets like the TPP.

She openly says that she does not believe in free speech and regularly censored negative stuff about her self from the site.

And she was in the process of bringing an overhaul to the AMA system. They obviously say it was not about monetization, but you would be a fool to believe that.

There are so many offenses in her personal life outside of reddit that I can't even be bothered to type it all out.

I am also troubled with her elimination of pay raise negotiations.

If something is not fair, we usually try to put safeguards into place or change the way, in this instance, raises are negotiated and approved. We don't just eliminate the process and it seems like backwards thinking.

But as a younger male nearing graduation I know I have a million other companies I can choose to try to work for and where I may have this advantage when it comes to raises. I don't have anything against 'making the playing field equal,' it just seems counterintuitive to pave over the field entirely rather than to attempt to transform it.

And also because male, I can offer only a drink from the pitiable well of my own empathy whenever she is described in such positive terms. It must be infuriating for a woman who studied law take advantage of sexism and public opinion to file frivolous lawsuits multiple times in her career.

I believe in free speech but I also respect the fact that this isn't a platform that I own and so the owners of the site are relatively free to moderate the content which appears. I'm not against moderation which deletes racist abuse, as that contributes nothing to the discourse. If I owned the site, I probably wouldn't ban the sub, but I don't care whether the sub is deleted. I also have the freedom to judge and voice my judgement about the value of calling someone a ""chinese bitch"" and posting about how I hope someone kills themselves. 

If a sub that contained actual arguments and critical analysis of Pao (or whatever else) was banned, i'd have a problem, but i'd just move to another site (if the situation was hopeless).

I believe in free speech, but i'm not going to be a waterboy for hate speech which has no value whatsoever. They're free to say it, but reddit is also free to remove it if they so choose. The people who insist on publishing that kind of thing always have Stormfront to fall back on.

The thing is, questions as to her character and CEO conduct are not hidden - it isn't as though a critically minded person who was so inclined would have trouble digging up the information for themselves. And so it seems to me expending a great deal of effort explaining to you why the hatred she's received is well justified would be effort inefficiently expended. I don't really feel the need to trudge up endless supporting links for the litany of points that can and should be made. 

But I'm a sporting fellow, so I'll name a handful of issues revolving around her that you should be able to confirm with a quick Google search if you're so motivated:

* There is an open question as to the legitimacy of her marriage. Her husband is a man who by all accounts, prior to his involvement with her, was staunchly homosexual. Not bisexual, not sexually confused, but exclusively gay throughout his romantic and sexual career. That, juxtaposed with Pao's own murky track record of infidelity have led many to suggest that it is a marriage of convenience meant to enable the pair to more efficiently climb the business success ladder. This is all the more insidious when you consider that her husband is essentially the black Bernie Madoff. 

* The court records from her lawsuit against KPCB make a few things pretty clear. First, she was a poor employee unsuited for her position, Meanwhile, as if almost seeing the writing on the wall, she instigated adulterous affairs with slightly senior individuals at the firm, so that she could cry retaliation if she didn't get promoted or handed whatever she sought at the firm. Ultimately, people who had far better performance reviews that her never rose to the level of senior partner, yet they didn't sue. Trying to play the gender card and setting back women in tech by many years, she did, and frivolously so. Throughout the process, KPCB went to great pains to be more than fair, offering her far more than she deserved. But she had dollar signs in her eyes and pushed an absurd lawsuit. 

* While CEO of reddit, she made a number of terrible policy changes in terms of hiring practices. First, she imposed an ideological litmus test, explicitly rejecting otherwise well suited candidates for employment because they didn't share her obsession with racial and gender identity politics. She further banned all salary negotiations for prospective employees under the guise of protecting women, which is flawed on too many levels to list. And as we saw with the firings that have come to light, she's not even shown loyalty to important employees whose tenure predates her reign, and who by all accounts were performing well. 

* She fundamentally upset the site's guiding ethic. Yes, the first subs were banned under Yishan's watch, so there was precedent. But he made great pains to ensure that the scope of these bans was narrow and in response to specific legal concerns. One might fairly object to the decisions he made, but they seemed more pragmatic than ideological. Meanwhile, Pao specifically rejected the idea that free speech was part of Reddit, and began a push to make reddit a ""safe space."" And throughout the waves of controversy surrounding her various policy changes, there was an unprecedented amount of censorship of dissent. ",False,False,False,99846,57519,1198888992.0,False,True

without going into too much detail, she did a lot more than smooth relations between mods and talent. She went above and beyond her role many times to help.

It's not just about the GREAT job she did with talent and mods, it's about what a GREAT and selfless person she was. Her willingness to go above and beyond with a smile no matter what it cost her ***is*** irreplaceable.

Should he be on the internet?  Yes.  No one's arguing that.  

As someone who is a redditor who subscribes to /r/MuseumOfReddit, I am telling you, specifically, in reddit, no one thinks /u/unidan deserves to be back.  If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either.  He admitted to the vote manipulation.

If you're saying ""bannable offenses"" you're referring to the reddit policy, which includes things from death threats to doxing to posting child porn.  

So your reasoning for demanding /u/unidan back is because random redditors ""want him back too?""  Let's get users banned for death threats and harassment back, then, too.

Also, saying he should be forgiven but being fine with banning people for posting CP?  You can't have it both ways, that's not how reddit policy works.  They're both bannable offences.  /u/unidan broke the rules and so did everyone banned for CP.  But that's not what you said.  You said /u/unidan should be back on reddit, which is not true unless you're okay with *all* banned users being allowed back, which means you'd be fine with people who posted death threats, doxing, and other bannable offenses, too.

Yishan understood very well that pissing off the user base was the reason for digg's demise, and he was terrified of the same thing happening under his watch. As a result, he was incredibly indulgent about bad behavior, even when he shouldn't have been. Even during ""the fappening"" he refused to make a clear stand against illegal and unethical behaviour, but at the same time couldn't bring himself to endorse it. His public announcement was wishy-washy and confusing to both sides. That attitude encouraged the trolls and haters, and soon by default the new ethos of reddit was ""anything goes"", even the shittiest of shitty behavior.

That new ""ethos"" that all the fatpeoplehate supporters chant for was the result of institutional neglect, not a moral principle of the founders. Spez would have cracked down on that bullshit quick fast in a hurry. He had no problem swearing at people in his posts. But since he was doing it in the name of what is right, he got away with it, and generally everybody fell in line.

Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no legitimate, surviving children. The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments. Publicly, she became a national icon, and was identified with strict standards of personal morality.

Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840. Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the sobriquet ""the grandmother of Europe"". After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.

Her reign of 63 years and seven months, which is longer than that of any other British monarch and the longest of any female monarch in history, is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover.

Just to be clear, I am not equated success or failure with colocation. What I am saying is that many of these people complaining about finding talent etc don't even really consider that maybe someone can be not at the office and move their game forward.

Lastly, open floor office plans suck and while maybe companies are still successful there is a growing body of research that claims this is despite those floor plans, not because of them.

If a person says a strong central government is a good idea, I might disagree. If a person says that murdering black people is a good idea, I don't have to be accepting. If a person says that being fat makes them a subhuman, unworthy of our respect, I don't have to be accepting.

A community can only exist when others have respect for each other. This is a far more fundamental truth than any high minded arguments about free speech. If a person is being cruel and hateful to another member of the community, that person no longer deserves to be part of that community.

There are two things that I want:

  -  I want people to be kind to each other.

  -  I want people to realize that others might accidentally be unkind to them, and to take steps to point that out and resolve the situation.

  -  I want people to realize that they themselves might be unkind to others, and to be open minded enough to correct their behaviour.

FPH did not follow these rules. I am glad they are no longer part of our community. coontown and company also don't follow these rules, so I am optimistic that they will be shunned as well. I disagree with many of SRS's policies, especially their willingness to treat ignorance as malice, but they primarily target people I have no respect for anyway.

My point is, no matter what Ellen would do in these past few weeks, her haters would NEVER forgive her. Never.
She could literally cure cancer and they wouldn't care. Everything she did, everything she said, it was used against her. It didn't matter what she said, she was downvoted, insulted, etc.

First, people were asking for a clarification and an apology about the whole Victoria fiasco. 3 days later, they got exactly that - a huge announcement thread in which the admins - especially Ellen - apologizied and promised a better future for reddit. It didn't matter, people were screaming ""This apology is just PR bullshit, it isn't sincere, nothing will change"" etc. etc. Nevermind that these people got exactly what they asked for - they used everything Ellen said against her. In that very same apology thread, people were saying ""I don't care about your apology, the only way to appease us is to step down. It's the right thing to do. Show us that you care and really mean it that you messed up, step down!""

And again, Ellen did exactly that, but it's clear as day that people still aren't happy, are still insulting her, are still mad at her, even though she did exactly what was asked of her. Seriously, say what you want about Ellen Pao, maybe she was a bad CEO, but in the last week, she did nothing - NOTHING! - negative on this site. All she was trying to do was explain herself, apologize, appease the users of this site. It didn't make a difference. Users continued downvoting her, harrassing her.

Okay, no offense meant, but I'm going to ignore the first two points. It's a sad state of affairs but almost all CEOs of major companies are not nice people. I don't care about her personal life or what she and her husband are doing or why. If someone is a CEO, I will start out assuming I will dislike them on a personal level.

The third point is valid. She's not a good boss, and that does affect the company and site. She's pretty cold hearted. Reddit should be a fairly friendly company if they want to maintain a friendly community, and she has failed miserably at that.

The fourth point... Honestly, I'm not sure. I can't see much evidence of those policies coming directly from her. Most of the fuss about censorship came from the banning of the few subreddits, but they never actually said that the banning were a result of her, did they? At least they didn't in the initial announcement. I'm not willing to place the blame for Reddit's censorship entirely on her shoulders, as it may have come from other employees or the board of directors.

So, you raise points about how she was a bad boss, and how she's a bad person, and I don't particularly disagree with those. But come on. People were sending her death threats and comparing her to Hitler. Is she really Hitler for not allowing salary negotiations? Even if the subreddit bannings were her idea and hers alone, does that make her as bad as Hitler?

The fact is, I still haven't heard anything that makes her out to be nearly as bad as the internet as a whole made her out to be. A vast majority of people claimed everything wrong with Reddit was her fault. I just don't see hard evidence that points to things being her fault and her fault alone for anything that negatively impacted the site. And I do like to believe in innocence until proven guilty.

That's why I maintain that the people who were campaigning against her and calling her Hitler and sending her death threats were incredibly immature about the entire thing, and usually either just getting on a bandwagon or blowing things way out of proportion.",False,False,False,128790,5754,1354476283.0,False,True

>If she was let go because of how the Jesse Jackson AMA went, or she refused to do the AMA's in a format that could be commercialized (a reasonable assumption given Pao's track record and legal history), that's absolutely our business.

No it isn't. That's called running a business. You may not agree with it, and that's fine. You don't have to come to reddit. 

>If she was let go because she didn't ""mesh"" with the way the company was going, which was contrary to the way we (the users, the only thing that keeps Reddit in business) wanted, she should absolutely be brought back.

Why? Do you honestly think a new CEO means new direction for the company? 

>If it was something else, like behavior or conduct or something unbecoming of a Reddit employee, that's different. And that would probably have to be some pretty wild stuff.

Wild how? You have no clue what was in her contract and what stipulations she could have violated. It could have been something mundane as hell, yet still warranted termination. 

>To be honest, everything that goes on in Reddit is our business. We're the ones that keep Reddit alive. We're the linchpin to the business. We should be kept in the loop about the dealings of this company, because the backlash of hidden bullshit will be so much worse the longer it sits.

With your logic, we'd also be entitled to know why every employee at Facebook, Twitter, etc. gets fired when they do. You've got some serious entitlement issues.

If you're saying ""/u/unidan family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Unidae, which includes things from copycats to troll acounts to clueless idiots.

You said /u/unidan is /u/unidanx, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the /u/unidan family /u/unidan, which means you'd call copycats, troll accounts, and other idiots /u/unidan, too.

_________________

The problems with reddit go back as far as the fall of Digg and how the loss of that magnet funneled everyone into reddit... and we lost our status as the top fraction of nerds...

Condé Nasté is overjoyed as they think that *masses* is good for profit... but they [didn't  factor in the bad seeds that are coming in with those sacks of grain.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia_esula#As_an_invasive_plant)
They sprouted up as *puns... lots of puns* and as the trolls and the like.

Reddit got larger and the admins lost track of what it that made the site great.
Communication broke down - that was the primary reason for the fall of Digg.
Yishan didn't see that either it seems.
His forcing people to move to one of the most expensive places in the nation forced many of the best people that were able to work out of their homes to give up their positions.  The voids were filled with people that couldn't communicate with the communities primary regulators -the mods. 

Not only did they now lack the tools, but they also didn't have any way to bridge the gap that formed between corporate types that used them for their free labor and expertise....  while the ""admins"" insulated themselves.  Their focus shifted to Silicon Valley politics, money and seeking power rather than the community of reddit.. and admins working out of their homes.
Then a series of continued mismanagement decisions (Yishan really earns top score here.. second only to Ellen's social justice and feminist agenda)


I'm trying to encapsulate a lot of things here... 
But basically reddit's problems go back deep and years in time. 
FPH is really a social backlash against the [""fat acceptance movement""](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/773/632/e77.jpg) Yes it's an inarticulate and perhaps emotional venting, but it it stopped someone from self harm and death via obesity then it can be viewed as having helped people and -save lives.   

All of this is well beyond the former CEO...  Ellen was just the last straw in a greater failing to cultivate the community.

Sam Altman's comments show quite clearly that he's also missing the mark by playing into the meme of the women being the victim and *blaming* the community for it's hostility... something I view as his deflection more than anything else.

No, you don't. But if you think you now have the right to remove them from the community completely then, again, you will ruin the community. All of their potential future contributions will happen somewhere else or not at all. That is the cost of your need to censor those who have distasteful opinions.

>A community can only exist when others have respect for each other. 

Is that true? I certainly disagree with it. Many communities consist of people who don't enjoy the presence of fellow members. I believe a fundamental part of life is tolerance of the presence of those who we find disagreeable. It's probably safe to say that *most* communities have people who disrespect and actively dislike each other. 

In the real world, though, you usually have to suck it up and tolerate them. Only on the internet can the insane notion of censoring and removing them completely even come into consideration.

People just hand wave away that the defaults are just shit, but they fail to realize that is the bulk of Reddit's traffic.  That is where the majority of users read and comment.  And there is so many awful comments that get upvotes and often times gildings in many of them.

It's a sad state of affairs but almost all CEOs of major companies are not nice people. I don't care about her personal life or what she and her husband are doing or why.

Entirely fair. The question of whether she's a good person and a good CEO are fundamentally different questions. I happen to think they have the same answer in this case - no - but that isn't universally true. I mention those points only because, while not relevant to her performance as CEO per se, they do add to the hate she's received, since many people consider the totality of Pao when speaking ill of her. Also, I think they provide some general insight as to her thought process, and are thus at least tangentially related to her reign as CEO.

> Most of the fuss about censorship came from the banning of the few subreddits, but they never actually said that the banning were a result of her, did they? 

This is true, but I think misleading. As CEO, she is fundamentally responsible for any decisions made within the company except those by the Board of Directors. Just understanding how corporate boards operate, it would be insane to think that they decided to ban the five subs (or the mushroom subs that followed). So no, while she never specifically said that it was her decision, I can't see how it would be reasonable to place the blame elsewhere. If you want to argue that perhaps others share the blame and benefit from a measure of anonymity, I'll concede that it is possible. But, to borrow from law, at best there is joint and several liability. That is, even if others were involved in the decision, she as a party to it is still fully accountable individually. 

>  People were sending her death threats and comparing her to Hitler. Is she really Hitler for not allowing salary negotiations? Even if the subreddit bannings were her idea and hers alone, does that make her as bad as Hitler?

I fully agree with you, and am not defending such conduct (the death threats - comparisons to dictators, presumably made in jest, are morally fine, albeit intellectually hollow). I advocated for her firing, and I hope to see her husband in jail for many years. But it doesn't mean I have to condone the worst excesses of the anti-Pao crowd.

In short, I take issue with your characterization that ""it was mainly twelve-year-olds who had no idea what they were raging about."" There are very significant reasons to be anti-Pao, and I think most of those most vocally so had a clear understanding of the issues. I certainly agree that some people responded inappropriately with death threats (or so it has been claimed), but I'm troubled by efforts to write off the anger of hundreds of thousands of the most active members of the community as simple juvenile rage without cause.

Extremists SJWs and racists are similar: they both are hung up on demographics instead of character and the ghettoization of reddit into fiefdoms ""owned"" by their moderators causes a lot of ""us v. them"" slap fighting.

I agree with the SJWs in principle, but the tactics of attempting to silence others is wrong. You can argue moral equivalency, that the racists censor too, but I expect people who portray themselves as morally superior and who purport to represent my politics to have a little more self restraint. I expect the community to chastise people who hatefully attack traditionally dominant classes of people as I reject treating people differently based on birthright or sexual preference. What I don't like is hate being excused because the target doesn't understand that he's privileged. It's the functional equivalent of blaming a girl being molested on her choice of dress. Those most involved in social justice are a trainwreck.

It's possible to actually care about social justice without being apologists for epitaph-tossing hateful people and without dragging the same issues into every topic of conversation.

Anita S. casually said that she wasn't a gamer when she started her video game tropes series. If it stopped there, it wouldn't be a big issue. There are outsider critics of every hobby and interest. Gun owners have their critics. Car enthusiasts have their critics. The difference with Anita S. and similar activists is that the press has transformed the outsider critic and dressed them up to be representative of the hobby. Gaming press was bullied into saying that all gamers hate themselves for treating women so bad in video games. Bullshit, it's just art. It's art that also actuates hand-eye reactions and spatial awareness that taps into primal drives. But to be clear, for the vast majority of gamers, the gender issues relating to characters in any game is taking a back seat to gender issues. If the gaming press last year was to be believed, the gender issues is all that matters. That is the danger of letting a clique of people who feel morally superior to their audience throw shit at others without restraint.

In the same way, the danger of letting a clique of moderators who feel morally superior to other redditors throw busy brigades and bannings without restraint and then implying that which remains represents the ""true reddit"" is a delusion. The truth of reddit is that good people outnumber the bad by a country mile. We shouldn't be in each other's corners hatching plans to strike at each other, we should all be wrestling in the same pen and we should be bitch slapping the fuck out of neo nazis, not hiding from them.

Reddit is not a safe place. To paraphrase Q's speech to Captain Picard: ""If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid."" 

As a white male liberal I have no problem putting on the boxing gloves and bitch slapping a racist idiot in an argument on reddit. When you ban him, you take that away from me.

Anyway, this is rambling on because it's late and i'm tired. But the thing is I found TIA, TIA didn't find me.

She is. Her dedication and resolve is not just a ""get the job done"" PR person. I dont agree that a lot of people would do things on the level she does. It's her person, her character, the Victoria that is special. She was MADE for this type of work. 

 I guess you'd have to know her, I'm probably doing a bad job of explaining it. I agree there are a lot of bandwagon people who didn't have any interaction with her defending her. I think that's great, of course, albeit a bit silly to follow without real direction.

Me neither. Alexis made it clear it was his choice.

meh. I decline to comment on this. She is classy, she wont give into (one way or another) the bash/rumor mill. 

I admit I have an extreme bias, but I will also say that I disagree that her personality isn't unique. The way she carried herself made people around her want to be a better person. She wasn't just a voice on a phone, she had valuable character which was evident in the AMAs she assisted with. She fought for more time, asked hard questions, etc.

That is kinda the point. If they aren't going to be respectful of others, then they don't get to be around others who are. If the cost of my ""censorship"" is a site with fewer racists, that is a cost I am willing to pay - not that I have the ability to make that decision anyway.

The term ""Distasteful opinions"" is a little weasely. Like I said, there are many opinions I disagree with that I think deserve to be heard. Thinking that I can walk around the streets and punch people in the face is an opinion too. There is a line between unpopular opinions and hate speech. Saying that being fat is unhealthy and that every fat person should probably attempt to make a change is an idea (one with its own problems, but not problems that involve banning people). Saying that a person is a subhuman, regardless of their actions, is not.

> Many communities consist of people who don't enjoy the presence of fellow members.

I'm guessing most of these communities are mostly communities of necessity, that have other reasons they are still together. If you have an example, though, I would be interested to hear it. Sounds like it could be an interesting study.

> In the real world, though, you usually have to suck it up and tolerate them.

The real world is mostly made up of decent people. There are also broad social changes that make hate speech socially unacceptable. We still have minds to change, but change is coming. Basically, no you don't. If someone approaches you in the street shouting slurs, most people will either ignore them, call them out, or at least socially exclude them. If they get aggressive, you can ask authorities to get involved. Basically, the real world is being censored all the time, in small ways.

Reddit is also mostly decent people. However, the system of anonymity and forming communities means that people who wouldn't dare express beliefs they hold in public can join communities that support those beliefs, and are less afraid to parrot those views into the Reddit ""public"". This reinforces Reddit as a ""safe-space"" for these kinds of beliefs, and makes them more vocal. Most of Reddit doesn't really condone it, but they don't care enough to speak out, or don't realize where these statements are coming from. This makes Reddit appear to be a haven for hate speech, which by positive feedback loop, makes it one. This same system is what causes the SJW culture on tumblr to form. 



> I want those things too.

I'm glad. I'm not advocating banning all edgy jokes, or insta-banning anyway who says something insensitive. I just want reddit(both officially and socially) to demonstrate that it isn't willing to tolerate hate speech, and that the kind of people who frequent fph or coontown are not allowed to use reddit as a tool to advocate their ""cause"" and recruit others.

My ideal world: the coontown network, plus the other hate speech and child pornography subs get taken down. Shadowban anyone subscribed. Hate Speech subs are chosen conservatively - i.e. things like KotakuInAction and BlackPeopleTwitter, while home to some of the worst people, are not fundamentally about hate, and at least pretend to be positive communties.

Reddit admins continue to take down any similar ones (unlike the violentacrez fiasco).

If you're interesting in a wide variety of things, try something interdisciplinary, perhaps?  I do ecological work, so sometimes what I look at is a mix of biology, geology and chemistry (hence, I'm technically a biogeochemist), and I like that.

And yet you fully subscribe to one of my most abhorrent notions: censorship as determined by some random person or administrator. That seems to me an endorsement that we are to be socially sculpted as someone else sees fit. It seems like it comes from a concern that those ideas will proliferate and propagate themselves, e.g.:

>the kind of people who frequent fph or coontown are not allowed to use reddit as a tool to advocate their ""cause"" and recruit others.

...whereas I believe that most people already have some of that in their system already and usually they just self-censor. Perhaps it's just a fundamental difference in how dangerous we consider ideas to be. Regardless, I appreciate the thoughtful replies.

People are starting to go back and look objectively at Pao's post history, reading her resignation post, not being so afraid of downvote brigades and speaking up. She's seems like a decent, well-intentioned human being.  She tried hard to do a job that was thrust upon her. She made mistakes perhaps, but she tried to learn from them.  This sort of person is not deserving of the level of hate levied upon her.

And fat people?  people don't really hate fat people, they hate the confusion of why it is such a problem. they hate how us as a species can have such an evolutionary flaw as to want to consume more than we need when there is very little risk of future shortages.  They hate how ""healthy"" quite reasonably equates to ""sexy"" and yet so many in our society, in their minds, reject both health and sexuality.  It doesn't make sense, and they rage at it. And if they are prevented from raging at it, then they rage at anything that gets in their way.  It's a resistance against accepting the ultimate truth that, in our innately selfish perspective, ""life"" is unrelated to ""fair""

But now that we've been forced to acknowledge the existence that cesspool; an apt-metaphor: a pit where negative things collect, and swirl about; we can finally start to step back, observe it, and begin to understand it.  Call me idealistic if you like, but I feel that with that understanding can be found the seeds to diffuse it; to take those strong, now hateful emotions, and help lead people to a logical narrative that will eventually allow them, or at least, those of their ilk in the future, to redirect that passion into more constructive and positive efforts.

  If you are seriously offended by the people hating on your ""progress"" pics, you shouldn't have posted them on the internet if you weren't ready to take whatever anyone says. If you think everyone on the internet is jolly and supportive then you should probably get off your computer because you clearly don't know what you're getting into.  
  If some people decided to make fun of you and that takes away all of the happiness you had recently, you are fucked. Might as well give up.

But I overcame it because I took action, and didn't make up reasons why I wasn't capable of fixing my life.  
  TLDR: Stop making excuses about being fat. The only one controlling your life is you. If you to get better, you actually have to work for it. Big surprise.

Lincoln University provides this information from its Criminal Justice department:

> While the language of the First Amendment appears absolute, [freedom of speech is not an absolute right](http://www.lincoln.edu/criminaljustice/hr/Speech.htm). Certain limitations and restrictions apply. Conflicts involving freedom of expression are among the most difficult ones that courts are asked to resolve. This ongoing process is often contentious and no one simple legal formula or philosophical principle has yet been discovered that is up to the trick of making the job easy...

> According to the current state of law, freedom of speech does not protect the following: Speech that contains ""fighting words"" (insulting or abusive language that is likely to cause ""an immediate violent response""); Obscenities; Language or communication directed to inciting, producing or urging the commission of a crime; Defamation - words or communication that are false and untrue and are intended to injure the character and reputation of another person; Abusive, obscene or harassing telephone calls; Loud speech and loud noise meant by volume to disturb others or to create a clear and present danger of violence.

And the New York Times writes an article that cites case law about how:

> [Online perpetrators can be criminally prosecuted](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/08/19/the-war-against-online-trolls/free-speech-does-not-protect-cyberharassment) for criminal threats, cyberstalking, cyberharassment, sexual invasions of privacy and bias intimidation. They can be sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In a few states, they can also be held to account for bias-motivated stalking that interferes with victims’ important life opportunities, such as employment and education.

Before that, the article states:

> But there is a point when trolling escalates beyond the offensive and shocking into cyberharassment or cyberstalking — actions that are not protected.

> Intermediaries — usually the websites where trolls post comments — *can step in to revoke the privilege of anonymity, or even remove abusive speech* that violates their community guidelines but when trolling turns into cyberharassment or cyberstalking, the law can and should intervene.",False,False,False,34718,3815,1436317922.0,False,True

You can only joke about ""niggers"" being an inferior race so much while citing *working links* to *real academic studies* that *claim to prove this* before you're just actually racist.

And the media only did so in response to the changes in attitudes of their consumers.  It wasn't leading that change, it followed suit and helped keep the ball rolling.

Honestly, the biggest contributing factor was that more and more LGBT people came out to their friends and families and helped those people realize they do know someone (often who they care very much about) who is LGBT and that those attitudes, comments and actions do impact someone they know.  Many of my family members and friends no longer hold many of the opinions they once did after I came out and after I explained to them how those viewpoints were homophobic and there are many others who will say the same.  And even those who faced great backlash for coming out furthered the improved image of LGBT among the masses, as many could not fathom kicking out their children or abandoning a friend who had always been there for them, and didn't want to be like those people.  

People coming out and putting a face to the people that these people regularly mocked and denigrated was and has been probably one of the biggest drivers of people's changing opinions in seeing the ""normalcy"" of LGBT people and them not matching up with the image that the media and fear-mongering social conservatives sold to them up until then.

And please keep in mind I am not talking about the blatant trolls we see on reddit.  Many of the people who make these casually racist, sexist, etc. comments aren't trolls.  They just don't know any better, don't have that line of empathy and don't see the context and connotations of what they're saying.  Only when they are able to empathize and have a face or relation to it do they tend to finally realize it.  On reddit, it's just very difficult to do due in part the anonymity of the users here.",False,False,False,34424,4757,1298535858.0,False,False

You won't get everyone, but it can and does result in usually those insensitive assholes being relegated to the bottom of the comment section or in their own little niche subreddits.

And sure, reddiquette says what upvotes/downvotes are for, but the reality of reddit is that it will ultimately be an agree/disagree function.  Plenty can easily make the case that those sorts of comments and views don't promote a valuable discussion and that was why they downvoted.  People use the upvote function all the time just because they like something, not because of the merit of the post or that it adds anything to the discussion at hand.  Hence why shitty pun threads make it to the top of almost every major reddit post, despite having little value to the discussion at hand in most of the subreddits. In an ideal environment, posts would be voted on for their merit and value to the discussion, but this is not the reality of reddit.

>The ""SJW!"" thing is kinda brought on by the constant whining over nonsensical stuff I suspect. Some of the so-called sexism or racism or whatever they've been focusing on has been so moronic that people are just getting tired of it.

There are plenty of people who overreact and I am not saying we must kowtow to every little complaint.  It's impossible.  But that doesn't mean just because of those people we should completely dismiss some of the at large casual derogatory comments and attitudes that pervade through reddit at large.  Every group has its extremists, its assholes and its misinformed.  That doesn't mean we write them off as a whole, much like your example of just because some Danes are racist, doesn't mean all Danes are racist.  But that also doesn't mean that the majority of Danes are incapable of holding some racist views or making a racist remark, while still feeling and thinking that they are not racist, nor even intending to be so.  But when you have a fairly large minority who says ""hey, that's kinda racist, maybe you shouldn't say that"" it might be worth considering not to.

And I'm not trying to say reddit is outright racist, or sexist or whatever.  But it regularly posts, upvotes and makes comments that are, while often not intending to, because the majority is not a part of the group it insults and thus does not fully understand why it is insulting.  Your words and actions can be derogatory and insulting without you ever intending them to be.  And it doesn't make someone a bad person when they do say or do those things.  But when, like many on reddit do, someone doubles down or throws up the defense of free speech when their words and actions are pointed out as being derogatory, that says then that you don't care about the fact that it's insulting, you care more about not being seen as racist/sexist/whatever than actually not doing/saying something derogatory.",False,False,False,34424,4757,1298535858.0,False,False

I'd personally say it's deeply connected to the banning of FPH.  That was, IMO, the first blow where Reddit really reacted viscerally to what she was doing.  That primed the pump.

Pao had already rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, and her wrong-headed decisions on these and other things pushed people to sign that petition and this in turn generated a lot of negative publicity.

As far as the community reaction? Well, I will continue the Microsoft comparison. The reaction was very similar to the way the community reacted to the E3 reveal of the Xbox One. There were good concerns that needed to be raised (Don was admittedly an unabashed asshole and needed to go) but the community decided the console was the embodiment of everything currently wrong in the world which was absurd.

you're being purposefully obtuse. It's very different to have characters to be sexist or misogynistic or racist, and it's another for the creators to be that way too. My favorite example is Archer: he is by ALL means a racist and sexist asshole, yet it's very clear that the show and it's creators aren't because literally all the other main characters in the show (most of them women) continuously call him on it. In the same vein, just because most of the male characters in Mad Men are sexist, doesn't meant the show is or it's viewers are by association -- in fact Mad Men, particularly in its last few seasons, had a pretty feminist slant.  

You can make the same argument about Peter in Family Guy -- clearly he's a sexist dumbass (especially re: his treatment of Louis) and we're supposed to make fun of him for it (and all the other reasons Peter is awful). The difference between Seth McFarlane and Adam Reed or Matthew Weiner is that the latter two don't take those attitudes their characters have onto the real world and make asses out of themselves the way Seth did at the Academy Awards where he stood there and literally made fun of the women in the room to their faces bc b00bz.

In much the same vein, making a sexist/racist joke to punch up (the way Louis CK does or Amy Shumer do in their comedy) in order to make fun of those attitudes, that's great! I'm all for that.

100% agree with you there. She made a name for herself in the community and you can't put a price tag on that.

Fair, though, since we have no clue *why* she was actually let go (everything is really just speculation at this point), it's unfair to bash reddit for it.
