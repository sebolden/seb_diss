- Join me in welcoming krispykrackers to her new and much deserved role of Head of Community at reddit!

- It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now.

- Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause.

- Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community.

- I want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community.

A lot of people can feel very isolated in the real ~~weird~~ world, whether it's because of depression or social anxiety or anything along those lines. I think one of the main reasons (aside from pictures of cats and boobs) that people keep coming back is that sense of community that reddit creates that is so often lacking in people's lives in the real world. 

I think /r/thebutton is an excellent example of that. Just a button and a timer with no guidelines or instructions, and yet out of that, enormous communities (and even rivalries) formed out of what color your flair was. Such an awesome experiment (read time-waster). 

That being said, I'd like to thank you /u/5days for all of your help in making reddit as awesome as it is!

As someone who is a scientist who studies popped corn products, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls kettlecorn popcorn. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""popcorn family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of orvillae, which includes things from toffeecorn to crackerjack to movie theatre butter.

So your reasoning for calling a kettlecorn a popcorn is because random people ""call the sweet ones popcorn ?"" Let's get chocolate dipped and popcorn balls in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A kettlecorn is a kettlecorn and a member of the popcorn family. But that's not what you said. You said a kettlecorn is a popcorn, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the popcorn family popcorn, which means you'd call Doritos, Bugles, and other corn snacks popcorn, too. Which you said you don't.

Darren Wilson is a hero.

Mike Brown had strong armed robbed a store just minutes before his death. When Wilson saw him, he did not know about the robbery. He stopped Mike Brown for walking in the middle of the street.

Brown, when confronted, like a typical thug with no respect for the law or authority decided it was in his best interest to attempt to fight an officer, grab his gun, and he lost.

Mike Brown, like so many of his 'brothers' would still be alive today if they possessed an ounce of common sense and chose more carefully their actions instead of thinking they're above the law. Wilson did the community good by taking another thug off the street.

So, a quarantine happens when you believe that at least 50.1% of reddit users would be extremely offended or upset by a community? Seeing as how we're a pretty liberal, secular crowd, I'd like you to please quarantine subreddits relating to religion and conservative politics. I, and arguably 50.1% of reddit, find them upsetting.

So, ""revenge porn"" and /r/TheFappening is OK, since the photos were *taken* with permission and only later used without permission?

> Do not post content that incites harm against people or groups of people.

What the hell is ""harm""? Only physical injury and illegal acts, or does it also cover any negative impact, such as loss of income or emotional distress? Further, when does somebody incite harm? If I make a post in good-faith that tends to increase the likelihood a person or group will be harmed, have I violated this policy?

> Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.

Like ""harm,"" this policy abuses the word ""safety."" What does it mean? Only physical safety, or the safety of my ideas *a la* [safe-spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space)?

As if that isn't enough, you've apparently created an exception to the content policy within its first hour:

> ... we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else.

Ridiculously, this standard for *banning* is easier to meet than the standard for quarantining. And it gets even worse when your later comments implicitly change the ""and"" to an ""or."" Reddit's content policy now seems to ban any content or communities that ""generally make Reddit worse."" You can't get more vague than that.

I also take serious issue with how quarantines are implemented. It's a generally good idea to keep certain, well-defined categories of content isolated. But requiring login and e-mail confirmation isn't so much quarantining as it is imposing arbitrary standards to make it harder for the communities to exist. Why not also start limiting their comments to 200 characters just for kicks? You could achieve a quarantine using much more narrowly tailored means--just require a NSFW-like confirmation per subreddit, exclude them from /r/all, and block search engines from indexing.

In short, I'm extremely disappointed. Not so much because of the policy itself but because of how you've misled the community into thinking that Reddit was truly interested in community feedback and in creating clear standards. **You've created a content policy with a bunch of words, but an overriding exception that boils down to ""if we don't like it.""**",False,False,1438815573.0,1984,1,1438810243.0,False,False

Both subs engaged in harassing behavior directed at the dentist who killed Cecil the lion. Reddit's policies define harassment as follows:

>Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.

The Cecil story remained in the news long enough that the comment trends ought to be considered ""continued actions."" The comments directed at the dentist were meant to demean him. The dentist could also reasonably believe that Reddit is not a safe platform for him to express his ideas or participate in the conversation.

**The harassment rules include no exceptions for public figures or subjects of news stories. They do not require direct contact with the victim.**

You can draw a picture of a minor, but say they're 18, and that's where the legal grey area comes up. To put it simply, IT'S FICTION. 

Regarding you saying this will encourage sexual predator, I think the opposite. Would you rather have them look at real CP, or fictional characters. You'd want the latter, of course. It provides an outlet for people who are attracted to underaged people to ""express"" their views without causing real harm.

Under that logic, why is SRS ***still*** not banned? They harass, dox, brigade, comb the histories of users they don't like solely to downvote ancient comments, and do nothing but talk about how much they hate Reddit (yet they still use it).

And just recently, a couple of SRS users [THREATENED A WOMAN WITH RAPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/3fc9qg/update_im_the_girl_who_received_rape_threats/) because she had the temerity to say something they didn't like.

You have been given numerous and REPEATED examples of SRS violating the VERY SAME RULES you use to censor other communities, yet you do NOTHING to SRS.

SRS is consistently voted [the most toxic community](http://idibon.com/toxicity-in-reddit-communities-a-journey-to-the-darkest-depths-of-the-interwebs/) *on the entire site*. They add nothing of value, and they actively seek to make everyone's experience worse.

And still, you do nothing. In doing nothing, you are complicit in their behavior. Your platitudes of ""banning behavior, not ideas"" is rendered bunk. You are actively seeking to silence not those who break rules, but those who hurt your feelings. Instead of banning them for the same reasons you supposedly banned other subs, you merely ""develop tools to keep them from doing anything mean.""

When CT or other 'offensive' subs hit the media, it's bad for business.  Advertisers don't like the negative press for sites they pay to promote their products.  Admin can't really come out and say this without looking like they've abandoned the original premise of reddit - totally rewriting it - therefore they make lame excuses and rules so vague that they can be applied at admins will  aka  'advertisers are complaining again'.  Because even though some subs don't have ads, when the advertisers or media rolls in to see what's up, the posts can be quite shocking for people who do not understand what reddit is.  

It's only fair to all of reddit that they just come out and say what the real deal is - $$$ - and what the real rules are, so that everyone can be on the same page.  At least that way, users have a choice of whether to access reddit or not.  

I don't think any of us are going anywhere, despite whatever vague rules they come up with or who they ban because we may fight, fuss, kick each other around, talk rude shit, shock the shit out of each other - but there is much human kindness at reddit too, and at the end of the day we're a true community....and hooked on reddit.

What makes r/anime safe from quaruntining, when it routinely gets similar stuff to the lolicon subreddit posts, *on the front page*, but you'll ban r/lolicon when it is not nearly as popular and rarely, if ever, shows up on the frontpage?

Now, I don't want r/anime to be banned or quaruntined, but this seems like a lapse in logic to me. Is it just the content in r/lolicon being purely about underaged-looking characters in sexual positions? Or is it something else? Do you think banning or quaruntining r/anime will just result in an uproar you want to avoid? If so, doesn't that mean you're only banning things convenient for you?

That said, I'm not that upset about that removal of that sub. It was the perfectly civil places like /r/neoFAG that was removed for no open reason, only because its users were GamerGate supporters.

Reddit has turned into a sanitized atmosphere, where users can't speak their true thoughts without either being banned or being shamed and bullied by the user base.

This hasn't been true in about a year. It seems like no matter what type of comment you post, there's somebody here to tear you to shreds using false information, straw-manned arguments, or ad hominems. The rate at which Reddit has changed in just this year has been frankly astounding.

Why? What actual harm comes from reading something offensive? I'm hugely offended by political correctness and some of these policies, but that doesn't stop you from saying them.

If the average redditor finds that community to be offensive, then they are free to not subscribe to that subreddit. (You are, of course, referring to subreddits because there is no other way to ""quarantine"" a ""community"", nor even to define a community on reddit.)

> we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else

That's what is known as a rhetorical smear. You are declaring their purpose as somebody who is opposed to them. Is that their own stated purpose? What is their position on the matter? What checks and balances are in place to ensure a just, due process evaluation of evidence to reach that conclusion versus just you enforcing your own personal beliefs, or those of sponsors. History is rife with authoritarians who rhetorically smear groups before oppressing or banning them. How can we judge the legitimacy of your actions? How do we know if you ban an anti-Monsanto subreddit because Monstanto pays reddit to do so, and you simply declare them as ""exist solely to annoy other redditors""?

> I believe these policies strike the right balance.

Then you believe wrongly. You have not explained one iota why banning and quarantining is necessary versus telling annoyed people to simply stop going to a subreddit.

If you are referring to individuals who frequent some subreddits who annoy others in other subreddits, then how does banning any subreddit stop this problem? Those individuals can still do the same thing. You are making a massive mistake of essentialism, that subscribing to a particular subreddit is a necessary part of annoying others. It is *individuals* that do that, and individuals who should pay the price for their behaviour.

This is why I moved to Voat and rarely come back here. (In fact, I was led here from a Voat link.) I can deal with annoying people and offensive positions by either ignoring them or criticizing their positions, even educating them to bring them around to a better position. (And sometimes even learning things myself in the process.) Authoritarian banning serves no useful purpose on a site like reddit, except perhaps to the authoritarians.

Goodbye reddit. You were once good, but your wrongheaded admins have poked enough holes in your hull to make you no longer seaworthy.

Let me check the calendar-- no, it's not April 1st, so I guess you're serious about this in which case? *What the hell were you thinking?!*

Look, I get it. Creating policies that are succinct enough to be understood by the average person is difficult. But would it have killed you guys to maybe elaborate a bit more on where the line between a subreddit being banned or it being quarantined lies? Does it just come down to your personal opinion? /u/spez, you will *not* be CEO of reddit forever (and yes, I'm sticking to the lower-case ""r"". Fuck the new style guide.). What happens when the next guy or gal takes the reigns and their personal opinion is different than yours? Will subreddits that you merely quarantined suddenly get banned? Will subreddits you banned be reinstated an quarantined? 

This is why the rules need to be more clearly defined. Ray Charles could see that.

I'm very disappointed by this new, vague, open-to-interpretation content policy you're implementing. And you know what? I don't even subscribe to any controversial subreddits! The reason I care about this is that like many others have stated, /r/srs still exists and it clearly breaks the rules you have set forth here but they're not even quarantined. Meanwhile you've yet to present any evidence for why some of the subreddits you've outright *banned* deserve the boot. So my question is: when a future redditor decides to make a subreddit, should he or she be afraid of what might happen to it? With clearer rules they would know what is and what is not acceptable. But right now you are sending HUGELY mixed signals (e.g. ""SRS can harass and bully people, we'll develop technology to stop them... but oh, THIS subreddit here? Yeah, they're banned because I don't like what they say... I mean, the average redditor wouldn't like what they say. Oh, this one? Meh, I'll just quarantine it, I think... This one? Ugh, I had to deal with them three times last week! That's taking up way too much of my time. Banned."").

""It's annoying to the average redditor"" is a bullshit answer, Spez, as is the ""it takes up too much of our time dealing with them"". Not only that, it's frightening. 

True fact: I have a friend who found /r/CatsStandingUp to be, ""creepy as fuck"". If the average redditor is like her does that mean they deserve to be banned? You'd probably say no. But what will the next CEO say? Or the one after that?

In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites.

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g)."" Source: American Psychological Association

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278) Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change. Source: University of Delaware

http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004socialconsequences.pdf

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

Source: University of Johannesberg

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/ravensiii.pdf

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

Source: http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-lowest-average-iq/

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites. Source: US Department of Education

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18] Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ#Estimates_of_the_heritability_of_IQ

What I'd suggest is that when a quarantine or a ban is put upon a subreddit that there is not only a list, but a brief written explanation of why the action was taken. That will help the community see that the policy really is content neutral, or it will expose the lack of neutrality.

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""
Source: American Psychological Association

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)
Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.
Source: University of Delaware

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

Source: University of Johannesberg

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/ravensiii.pdf

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.
Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

Source: http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-lowest-average-iq/

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""
Source: American Psychological Association

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)
Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

Source: University of Johannesberg

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""
Source: American Psychological Association

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)
Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.
Source: University of Delaware

http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004socialconsequences.pdf

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

Source: University of Johannesberg

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/ravensiii.pdf

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.
Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

Source: http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-lowest-average-iq/

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.

http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/studies/2009495.pdf

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

I'd've been interested in a democratic vote on which of coontown or SRS most would like to have seen banned.  Coontown was contained and most of us just ignored it, just like we do with people in society who habour hatred or extreme views, yet SRS pervades everywhere and is the great untouchable.

Personally I think you've made a mistake with more banning, when you could've used your new quarantine opt in.

Which essentially means this is becoming a morality police.  I can applaud taking down harassment, but drawn child pornography?  What's next? Any swearing?  we already don't want swearing.  And if we go by ""illegal"" in any area then much of reddit needs to be closed.  Hell there are laws that say women must be fully clothed in a burqa if in public, so /r/realgirls and all the rest should be shut down because that's illegal. 

Before people go ""It's horrible"".  This is drawn.  No child is harmed from taking a picture, no child is harmed by looking or distributing it.  It's usually not considered child porn because it's... not child porn.  It's a drawing, just as a drawn picture of a celebrity nude isn't the same as a picture of a nude celebrity. 

The real problem here is this is morality judgements.  This isn't ""harassments and downvoting"".  This is just someone's enjoyment. 

There's another important problem here, the collection of email addresses for these Quarantined subreddits.  While this isn't as bad as it could be, it still is a step to collect potential harmful addresses.

2534,8df07,ctsvv2n,t3_3fx2au,t3_3fx2au,1438813747.0,0,"I believe, that the more you [Reddit] try to walk this fine line of what is right/wrong, hateful/humorous, good/bad the more you will find that the fine line is actually too fine to stand on.    Every step you take you will inevitably slip off of one side or another.

It is your fourth bullet point in the ""unwanted content"" section of your linked content policy that much of the objection is being raised about, which states:
>Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.

You claim that harassment is actions to demean/torment *someone*, not a group of people, segment of society, or type of anything.  Maybe it is ironic that at it's core, your decision in many ways mirrors that of the Supreme Court in the recent, and now arguably imfamous, [Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) Supreme Court decision.  It's the motivations behind this viewpoint that is questioned by many, and perhaps even to a higher degree in the user base of your site in particular.

The question before you is can free and open speech happen in the same place where hateful content does.  The answer is yes.  However this is why privacy rules, and the 5th rule in your Content Policy / unwelcome content in particular is SO vitally important.  If information here is not personally identifying, no individual would have good reason to fear for their own safety for posting their comments.  It is our anonymity to our audience that protects us from fear of retribution.

What are you/we/us/the world/reddit to do with hateful content anyway?  Hide it?  Banish it?  Destroy it?  None of these things are *solutions* to your problem.  Free and open conversations?  Well here is what I want to do, here is how I want to exercise my freedom: I want to be able to go in to those hateful Sub's every once in a while and tell them to Fuck Off.  I want to be here, to be loud enough so they know.  I WANT THOSE HATEFUL ASSHOLES TO BE ABLE TO HEAR ME LOUD AND CLEAR.  

But if you ban them.  Make them leave, go away.  What will they hear.  They will hear themselves.  In their own self-loathing mixed world of shit, until one day they decide to come back.

I believe that reddit is still a good place, and it accomplishes the goals you set out in your posts about being a place for authentic conversations.  The questions before you though is do people feel safe to open their thoughts and opinions or not.   Hate exists.  It always will.  But your policies are not creating a better place, just a more insulated one.  We, as humans, actually have a responsibility to engage this hate, reason with it, and bring these people back.  Banning these hateful groups isn't going to make them go away.  I feel safer knowing what/how/where people hate others in this world, because every place I know, might be a place where somehow I could have a chance to make a difference and help someone stop hating.  I don't know how to do that though, probably I never will.  But some of us do.  Some one person might.

I was thinking about sending you a message the other day but I didn't know if I was allowed to do that.

I humbly ask that the next rules to be revised to be the rules on shadowbanning and self-promotion.

I've had my account shadowbanned for having more than 10% of my posts go to the same youtube channel. (mine, which is non-profit).
I read that you said shadowbanning should never happen to real users. I'm a real user who makes videos for my community. Not all of them are hits but some of them are. I got an answer from an admin, and he said the shadowban was justified. (He didn't reply when I asked about your comment that real users should never be shadowbanned.) I didn't get a warning. Now I'm banned forever I guess. I thought the mine/not-mine ratio was 50%ish percent not 10%. 

Anyway I would like to see a reddit where I can post my videos and the users with their up and down votes and the subreddit mods can decide what stays or goes, and the self promotion rule can apply to people obviously trying to make money or sell viagra.

If I were to comb thru reddit and check the most popular 'hero' redditors, I think I'd find a good number of them post to their own content more than 10% of the time. Should they be shadowbanned too? I don't think that would be good for reddit. I could give an example but I'm afraid the guy might get banned.

Summary:    
Please make it so:     
""no real user ever gets a shadowban.""    
People get warnings.     
People get partial or timed penalties (can't post buy can still comment, can't post for a week - vs shadowbanned forever)    
Allow content creators to post their content at greater than 10% ratio. If I post 9 crappy not-my-things just to be safe to post my 10th thing that doesn't help reddit.

>You need to understand that there are a shockingly high number of people who don't understand the philosophical concept of free speech and free thought.
Back in Phil101 I had to do a debate on Speech Codes. Back then I wasn't even remotely ""racist"" by today's standards. I was writing essays against white privilege passionately at the time. Anyway, I remember I had to defend the idea of people being able to speak and write whatever they want - including racist things - on their own private sites.
That is't quite the same as what has happened here. But more on that in a minute.
The point is that the class already took issue with this. The mere act of speaking those words seemed to have the psychic effect of makong them feel as though I was apologizing for hateful ideas and thoughts. Yet what I was really doing was standingg up for a radical anti-authoritarianism that is against any situation where authority is concentrated in one group over another, so long as that group does not intrude.
So, it was a wake up call for me. When it comes to identity politics and any issue one might consider related to ""political correctness,"" people are profoundly stupid.
Yet since then I became aware of radically free thinking texts like The Bell Curve. Discussion of ""racist"" texts like those is all but forbidden everywhere on this site. And I find that to be downright embarrassing for everyone involved.
Now, the difference is that Reddit is a private site.
But that doesn't change the fact that the idea and concept of free speech is still a thing. And by all measures of fairness, Reddit has shown that it does not support those concepts and philosophies. It supports authority rule over fringe subs and controlling what is allowed to be spoken - and thus thought - on its URL. And that's very sad.
There is no way around it. Coontown existed. Nobody had to look at it. But ideology and ideas are now being enforced. Thought is being enforced. And the mere existence of those thoughts is intolerable now, regardless of whether they actually appear elsewhere. The mere freedom of thought was too much.
Instead of debate and discussion, the boot is used. I might have shrugged and said ""little has been lost, it's bad but oh well,"" but today I know that this represents the debasement of a philosophical idea and that this site does not stand for what is right anymore.
I encourage people to leave now instead of apologizing for Reddit. You may agree with their ideas and political views, yet you now do so without any risk of being challenged. Your ideas are now to be enforced like a religion. That's not something to be proud of. It's something to be ashamed by.
The tendency is to laugh this off. ""It's minor."" ""Come on, they're just racists!""
Sure. It's also just the ability for individuals to decide for themselves what's right without being told by the guy wearing the Swastika or Stalinist Insignia on his shirt what he can and can't think. It's the right for groups to naturally discover the best ideas via discussion unfettered by ideological dogmatism and people looking over their shoulder telling them they ""just can't say that.""

Reddit also has a change to the Content Policy that explicitly bans content that features minors being sexualised, not just content that sexualises actual minors. Further, it is often comorbid with depictions of actual minors being sexualised, and is used by predators to condition their victims.

> What is involuntary pornography?
> 
> Photographs, videos, or digital images of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, taken without your permission. This includes child sexual abuse imagery, which we will report to authorities, content that encourages or promotes pedophilia or sexual imagery–including animated content–that involves individuals under the age of 18.

The first sentence fragment of this answer attempts to *define* the term ""involuntary pornography"": *""Photographs, videos, or digital images of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, taken without your permission.""* This is offered as an *answer* to the question, ""What is involuntary pornography?""

This is very similar to [Google's takedown policy](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2744324) on ""revenge porn"", which covers *""nude or sexually explicit images that were uploaded or shared without your consent.""*

Let's assume everyone agrees with that definition. I certainly do, and it seems to pretty much be the consensus for major sites these days.

The problem is the next sentence (emphasis added):

> **This includes** child sexual abuse imagery, which we will report to authorities, content that encourages or promotes pedophilia or sexual imagery–including animated content–that involves individuals under the age of 18.

But as a matter of actual fact, some of those things don't fit the definition given in the first fragment; and this makes the whole paragraph incoherent.

As it stands, the policy has the same logical structure as:

> What is murder?
> 
> The deliberate, unlawful killing of a human being. This includes cutting the head off of a living or dead person, cutting their toes off, or praying to God — even to a pretend god you just made up — that they have a heart attack.

Let's hit Reddit where it'll hurt them the most... right in the sheckles. **Oy vey!** The only reason CoonTown was BANNED instead of quarantined like we were originally promised is because the BlackLadies contacted Reddit's advertisers. We can do the same!

Maybe a couple of those subs did engage in harassment, but all the other ones (like the animated CP ones) did not and the only reason that fits is that it ""prevents (them) from improving reddit"".

Back in Phil101 I had to do a debate on Speech Codes. Back then I wasn't even remotely ""racist"" by today's standards. I was writing essays against white privilege *passionately* at the time. Anyway, I remember I had to defend the idea of people being able to speak and write whatever they want - including racist things - on their own private sites.

That is't quite the same as what has happened here. But more on that in a minute.

The point is that the class already took issue with this. The mere act of speaking those words seemed to have the psychic effect of makong them *feel* as though I was *apologizing* for hateful ideas and thoughts. Yet what I was really doing was standingg up for a *radical* anti-authoritarianism that is against any situation where authority is concentrated in one group over another, so long as that group does not intrude.

So, it was a wake up call for me. When it comes to identity politics and any issue one might consider related to ""political correctness,"" people are *profoundly stupid*.

Yet since then I became aware of radically free thinking texts like *The Bell Curve.* Discussion of ""racist"" texts like those is all but forbidden *everywhere* on this site. And I find that to be downright embarrassing for everyone involved.

Now, the difference is that Reddit is a private site.

But that doesn't change the fact that the *idea* and concept of free speech is still a thing. And by all measures of fairness, Reddit has shown that it does not support those concepts and philosophies. It supports authority rule over fringe subs and controlling what is allowed to be spoken - and thus *thought* - on its URL. And that's very sad.

There is no way around it. Coontown existed. Nobody had to look at it. But ideology and ideas are now being enforced. *Thought* is being enforced. And the mere *existence* of those thoughts is intolerable now, regardless of whether they actually appear elsewhere. The mere freedom of thought was too much.

Instead of debate and discussion, the boot is used. I might have shrugged and said ""little has been lost, it's bad but oh well,"" but today I know that this represents the debasement of a philosophical idea and that this site does not stand for what is right anymore.

I encourage people to leave now instead of apologizing for Reddit. You may agree with their ideas and political views, yet you now do so without any risk of being challenged. Your ideas are now to be enforced like a religion. That's not something to be proud of. It's something to be ashamed by.

The tendency is to laugh this off. ""It's minor."" ""Come on, they're just racists!""

Sure. It's also just the ability for individuals to decide for themselves what's right without being told by the guy wearing the Swastika or Stalinist Insignia on his shirt what he can and can't think. It's the right for groups to naturally discover the best ideas via discussion unfettered by ideological dogmatism and people looking over their shoulder telling them they ""just can't say that.""

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""
Source: American Psychological Association

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)
Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

Taken with zero context, and without considering this happened in the midst of Reddit banning a few subs and /u/violentacrez getting doxxed, SRS users decided that I was tolerant of rape, or beating women, that I was lazy, a shit-poster, pandering to my ""audience"", suggested SRS users go to Amazon to see what a piece of shit I was, that I thought ""rape"" was ""freedom of speech"", and that I was objectively wrong and thought ""freedom of speech"" was moderating a website.

They hadn't bothered to read the rest of my comments, where I said ""If this were MY company and these subreddits were on MY board, I'd delete them in a heartbeat, because I find them personally offensive.""

I was banned from SRS years ago (not for commenting, just because one of the mods thought I should be -- that's their prerogative) so I messaged the SRS admins and asked for a chance to respond, considering this post was #1 in SRS.

As you can see, the only response was ""ROFL"".

/r/Fatpeoplehate was created to mock people based on a subjective perception.

/r/Coontown was created to mock people based on a subjective perception.

/r/Shitredditsays was created to mock people based on a subjective perception.

This is their stated purpose:

>""Have you recently read an upvoted Reddit comment that was bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, transphobic, racist, homophobic, or just reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege? Of course you have! Post it here.""

They exist to mock and harass Reddit users. 

>we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else.

Your words. 

Please explain to me how holding other people up to ridicule *without even allowing them to respond* is good for reddit, encourages participation, and makes Reddit a safe place to express our opinions and ALSO differs from the subs you've banned.

EDIT: And this comment was already linked in SRS:

He regularly contributes to /r/KotakuInAction[2] , not sure why he feels like he'd be welcome here at all. He's also complaining about the existence of SRS, so yeah right there he'd be banned.
Oh no, a sexist/racist/homophobic/transphobic post was made and got linked here. WOULD ANYONE THINK OF THE RACIST'S FEELINGS?

This is a perfect example.

I have posted in KiA, and it has been fascinating to talk with the people there. Much like it has been fascinating to talk to the people in GamerGhazi.

But without context, someone might assume that because I've posted or commented there that I'm racist, misogynistic, transphobic, or maybe just an asshole. And suggesting that I think I'd be welcome in SRS, *outside of responding to people talking about me there* is ridiculous.

So with this extra data in mind, should I feel comfortable and safe posting in controversial subreddits? Or should I stay in the safe ones, stick my head in the sand, my fingers in my ears, and never discuss anything outside of cat pics?

EDIT: Since this is gaining traction, I'd like to say this about hate speech: Hate speech is by its nature subjective, which is why banning it is generally a bad idea. [Here is a 2.5 hour speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6w1S8yrFz4) by Warren Farrell. In it, he talks about things like boys falling behind in education or the fact that males are far more likely to commit suicide than women. There is nothing hateful in that speech, yet the campus feminist group protested his speech in the weeks leading up to it. They tried to get it cancelled and ripped down the flyers for it, and finally staged [this protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0) to physically prevent anybody from entering. Because to many college feminists, simply acknowledging men's issues is ""hate speech."" Simply talking about the fact that boys are 30% more likely to drop out of school is hate speech. Simply mentioning that men are 4x more likely to commit suicide is hate speech. Please watch both the video and the protest, and keep in mind that the people calling for hate speech to be banned are the people who wanted Warren Farrell's speech banned for being ""hate speech."" Similar protests involving pulling fire alarms to shut down talks about male victims of domestic violence have also happened. 

The problem with banning hate speech is that not everybody agrees on what hate speech is, and a lot of people consider legitimate discussions of men's issues to be ""hate speech"" that should be banned.

I was thinking for-sure they would just become an ad-free subreddit dedicated to hate hidden behind an 'opt-in' wall.

**Edit;** /r/Kiketown is still there. No ads for them, as they have been whitelisted by reddit staff for ad-free status, less trolls because you have to be email verified, and no spam bots because you have to opt in. You actually made life better for them. Guess I'm not shocked at all. 

/r/kiketown got the [reddit seal of approval!](https://i.imgur.com/tPBsatd.jpg) We did it reddit.

Clearly SRS is not even on the same continent as bad as /r/c..t..n but SRS does exist solely to harass people on reddit and their mission statement is to make reddit's life miserable. And you are letting them succeed.

SRS, and AMR are not there to discuss ideas. They are there to stifle dissent, police ideas, shame/slander/harass people and keep ideas they dislike from being an acceptable part of conversation.

As one example: explain why most of reddit now uses np links and srs refuses to use np links.

You can allow them to exist, but you should stop giving them preferential treatment, either out of cowardice, or out of cowardice.

When you're writing rules you can't include a list of everything that would break them, which would be the most clear way of writing a rule. This is because you would inevitably leave things out or people would change one small thing so it didn't quite break the rule. People would violate the spirit of the rule but not the letter of the rule. Additionally, you could include some behavior you didn't mean to. This is where people violate the letter of the rule but not the spirit of it. The more specific you make the rule, the easier it is for bad actors to find a way around it, and the more over- and under-inclusive it becomes. 

On the other side, you can state the spirit of the rule itself, which leaves open the possibility of making sure the rule is applied when it should be and not when it shouldn't. But then it can be difficult for someone to be able to tell what's actually prohibited. What this ends up doing is pushing the meat of the judgment onto the people enforcing the rule instead of on the people writing the rule. This makes theoretical sense because they are the ones looking at what actually happened in the specific case. However, it does allow for both intentional and unintentional misapplication of the rule.

So in writing its content policy, reddit has to decide between 1) writing very explicit rules that make it easy for bad actors to find loopholes and that capture unintended behavior, and 2) writing vague rules that make it easy for mods to abuse their power and don't guarantee avoiding the bad outcomes from explicit rules. They've chosen the latter, and the thing that will hopefully make it work is the promised transparency. This could make it more difficult for mods to abuse their power with no repercussions. The important thing will be to see how this works in practice.

I honestly prefer the more vague rule, though that may be because I'm a law student in the US (where much of our law is written vaguely). I wouldn't want to have to read through a long list of things that aren't allowed every time I thought about posting something to make sure I didn't break a rule, especially if the rules weren't effective at what they were intended to prevent.

Reddit is no longer the free-speech bastion that it was when it was created.  Remember, one of the founders faced [35 years](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/us/20compute.html?ref=us) for his beliefs that information (and speech) should be free.

Now, Reddit is a corporation.  It exists solely to make profit (eventually, they hope).  We will either need to live within this new realty or find a new place to call home.  They naively think that somehow there will be no racists now that they got rid of /r/coontown and those related subs.  Instead, in the past six months all they've done is push those communities into the limelight.  Five years I've been here and I didn't know they existed until the controversy.  For being the ""front page of the internet"" you would think that they would understand the Streisand Effect.

Read all the policy updates you want, they don't mean anything.  What they really mean is ""we don't like controversial subreddits."" Period.  They don't care about legality, they care about advertisers. If they did, /r/sexwithdogs (which I learned about from this thread) wouldn't exist.  Neither would /r/trees.  

If they really cared about harassment, they'd ban SRS (which has been pointed out numerous times).  They banned /r/fatpeoplehate and yet /r/fatlogic exists with no problem.

The bottom line is that reddit doesn't want to be reddit anymore, it wants to be buzzfeed, 9gag, etc.  It wants cheap advertiser money that comes from small, easily digestible content that's safe and fun for the whole family.

In the decision, the Supreme Court noted that the law was a ""stark example of speech suppression"" because it prohibited visual depiction of underage teenagers engaged in sexual activity, which is a ""fact of modern society and has been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages.""

The Court then goes on to note all the works of art and literature that depict ""children"" (underage teenagers) having sex: Romeo and Juliet, Traffic, American Beauty. 

Are you going to ban /r/literature if it has a discussion about the book Lolita? Sexualization of minors isn't limited to the subs you banned. It exists so ubiquitously in our society that the Supreme Court thought banning it would be an unprecedented intrusion on free speech.

This ban has nothing to do with the content policy. The Supreme Court made a clear distinction between laws that protect children (banning pornography that depicts real children) and laws that target content we don't like (e.g. drawings of children having sex). Reddit's policies were clearly aimed at the former (actual depictions of real children). The subs you banned violated your **new** content policy, which is: don't be a sub that has stuff the Reddit team doesn't like, unless you're a popular sub (SRS, WTF), and then it's cool.

It's been said that you are going to remove the more cancerous subreddits. I'm curious as to whether ShitRedditSays will be included among this category. On the face of it, a place where reprehensible comments are pointed out, right?
It must have been two years ago now when shit hit the fan and I found a link to a thread where one redditor, clearly in a distressed state, had made a post alluding to their future suicide. Now, of course, the vast majority of responses were what you would expect from most humans. Compassionate and sincere posts offering this person help and support. Who on earth would tell a person in this condition to kill themselves? Or worse, tell them the world would be better off without them? Enter ShitRedditSays.
The comments made towards this person by a significant portion of people are among the most disturbing things I have ever seen on this site. It was the sort of thing I would expect to see on SRS, as a showcase of how awful Reddit is. So, I went to the sub to see if they were talking about it. They were, but not in the way I had expected. They were bragging. They were laughing. They were celebrating. The suicidal person in question was affiliated with the MRA sub, something that SRS greatly opposes. So much so, they brigaded the thread the person had posted in, and told them to kill themselves. Repeatedly told them. And when the person did, they were happy. Because, to them, this was a war. And anything was acceptable. Telling a suicidal person to kill themselves was perfectly fine. That is how lacking in perspective many of these people are.
Much of what was said was deleted shortly afterwards so it would not be visible anymore. Well, almost all of it. The below is only a tiny fraction of what was said. There was a lot worse.

http://i.imgur.com/4qMV8.png
http://i.imgur.com/nSCSV.png
I had always thought SRS was merely a sub dedicated to showcasing the darker side of this site. A way of promoting change, but nothing malicious. I messaged one of the mods about what had happened expecting them to condemn the behavior, but instead they bragged about it like some sort of psychopath. It was one of the most fucked up conversations I have ever had. Further examination of the sub and their mods clearly showed that this is a group of people who are in fact quite hateful. Many of the mods displayed blatant prejudices against various groups.
And the media doesn't show this side of SRS, for whatever reason. Possibly out of laziness or perhaps because SRS deletes the vast majority of their more shameful history. We hear about how they got rid of the disgusting Jailbait sub, something that I (and I'm sure many others) was very happy about. But we never hear about the racism, sexism or harassment that they so frequently partake in. So, on the face of it. SRS is this progressive humanitarian group that Reddit can showcase as an example of how the site is not just a cesspit of evil. Am I right?
And that's how it appears to many users of the sub too. Young teenagers in many cases. Progressive, well meaning individuals who want to highlight the unsavory things that are said throughout this site.

a breakdown as to why this reason is a bad reason:

1. it's false - falsehoods listed below:

   a. coontown did not exist solely to annoy other redditors

   b. coontown did not prevent anyone from improving reddit

2. it's meaningless:

   a. reddit was not ""generally worse"" because coontown existed. one could argue that the existence of coontown, despicable though the particular subreddit may have been, actually improved reddit as a whole, because it was an indication that the site was truly free of censorship. you knew that if coontown existed, then there really were no secrets. unfortunately some people value comfort over truth

   b. coontown did not affect ""everyone else""

coontown was an isolated part of reddit that many redditors who have been here a long time (including myself) didn't know existed

banning coontown (which i would personally categorize as a disgrace to human intelligence, if i were making such judgments, but I'm not) is completely opposed to everything that reddit used to originally stand for.

**Title-text:** I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.

> As you're probably aware, recently reddit has experienced a good deal of blowback over some rule changes intended to ensure that reddit is a safe and more welcoming community for all of its users. Specifically, a number of openly racist subreddits have been banned and their users are particularly upset about it.

> I noticed one particularly disingenuous post that you may want to check out: in this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctt29ld) the poster indicates that because their hate speech will no longer be enabled, they intend to contact reddit's advertisers to alert them of a number of beastiality-related subreddits as well as some dedicated to other ""nontraditional"" but legal pornography or fetishes including LGBT, swinging, and incest fantasies. While I don't necessarily condone the perpetuation of some of these subreddits, I felt that you should be made aware of this person's true motives for contacting you-- they may be truly disgusted by their existence, but the timing of this post and the poster's emails implies that their goal is to damage reddit in retaliation for disallowing their hate speech.
> 
> I wouldn't be surprised if the post and/or account related to it were deleted in the near future, so I'm attaching screenshots of both the post and a partial history of the poster's comments.

> While I am personally in favor of reddit's new restrictions, I'm indifferent to your ultimate decision concerning your choice to advertise there. However, I feel that it is in reddit's and your own best interests to have the full context.

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""
Source: American Psychological Association

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

**EDIT:** Since the guy above me has decided to post a wall of text, I think I have *carte blanche* to do the same.

**First**: The distinction between subreddits that could promote real life harm to innocent third parties and those subreddits that simply anger other Redditors. Some websites either have users that are predisposed to violence against minorities or, perhaps, spur otherwise non-violent individuals to violence. 

Consider [Stormfront, which is a proud example of this](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/04/17/splc-report-nearly-100-murdered-stormfront-users). Obviously, it's impossible to say which of these two possibilities are true, but it is impossible to rule out the possibility that **some websites can incite some users to real life violence.** 

Hate speech against minorities runs a long track record of this problem, wherein a group mentality can be provoked to acts which lone individuals are less likely to perpetrate absent perceived support from others of the same belief. A private corporation such as Reddit has *no legal obligation* to protect speech of any kind. Hence the appropriate decision to ban such speech, as that Reddit's corporate overlords probably are like most humans in that they'd rather not feel potentially responsible for harm to others than to protect highly hateful speech.

**Second:** SRS is designed to provoke the ire of people, but it's not hateful. And the people it irks are just having their own words thrown back at them. It's just trolls trolling trolls, except that people are taking it all very seriously, which is weird.

As such, if SRS really bothers you, it's probably because of who you are more than who they are. Sorry if you don't like that, but it's just how it is. 

**Lastly**, the vast majority of replies to this comment are straw-man arguments that distort SRS by claiming that the comments being quoted and linked from other subreddits are in fact the opinions of SRS users instead. This type of argumentation is uncompelling to anyone who actually analyzes what they are doing in that subreddit.

That's my two cents, and I'm now going back to being a regular redditor and staying out of the drama. If anyone wants to talk about something non-drama related, there are great places throughout Reddit to do so, and I hope to see you there. While I'm at it, thanks /u/spez, it's a small step in the right direction, and I understand that you can't take a bigger one just yet because any large changes are likely to create significant disruption and cause more harm than good.

Until then, you have no complaint per the administrative staff's rules.

There is no code that says the owner of a large forum has any duty to run that forum like a community space, without restriction. Your

Originally, they used rules to make decisions on who to ban. Those who violated the clear rules would suffer the consequences. Now banning is much more subjective. If reddit determines they have to ""spend a lot of time"" dealing with it they can ban it. Or they can just say ""this offends the average redditor"" and ban it.

Those things they are afraid to ban outright, they will put it behind further restrictions, adding an additional layer of difficulty to view it (basically, if you want to sub to a quarantined subreddit, they will have your email so nobody will want to even view them with their primary account out of privacy concerns).

This is an effort to force such subreddits to dry up and hopefully move on voluntarily to other sites so reddit won't have to deal with outright banning.

This banning has just begun. Since they banned some, they will have to continue to ban more and more content, because anything they do not ban will come across as accepted by the website.

Incorrect. I'm a mod there, and I have received two such notices, and I took the items down. The first one I had a discussion with another mod there on how it should be handled, and was decided to quickly honor the request and take the submission down. So it's not just me.

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""
Source: American Psychological Association

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)
Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.

The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.
Source: University of Delaware

http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004socialconsequences.pdf

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matrices which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

Source: University of Johannesberg

http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/ravensiii.pdf

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

Source: http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-lowest-average-iq/

7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.

9) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

Yeah, ok, but the situation you're describing is a lot less considered. Someone makes a problem, the reaction is to remove the person immediately, to protect the other patrons from their behaviour, which, in this case, involves disrupting a movie.


Literally a month ago, this situation was ""on the radar"" for the admins. They proposed altering their content policy to more clearly delineate what the correct behaviour for the community was, and also proposed having a new opt-in policy for content deemed offensive.

A month later, they change the policy. Nowhere in the policy does it specify ""racism"" (which I think a plurality of people probably agree is wrong already, so this is hardly contentious as an inclusion for the sake of clarifying the ""reddit position"") is a bannable offense. At best, it falls under the ""...harasses or bullies..."" line, maybe, if you think it's possible to indirectly bully a group of people by saying negative things about the group.

Then they ban /r/CoonTown. But not other subreddits that indirectly harass or bully groups in indirect ways, like /r/KikeTown, or /r/TheRedPill.


So the alteration of the content policy didn't actually clarify the rationale for the actions, or, in some cases, the rationale for acting in one situation, and withholding action in another.

To bring this back to your metaphor, it would be like whistling in a movie, being told it was against the rules, finding out it was not specifically disallowed by the theater's rules, being told to wait in the movie for an hour while they ""clarified their policies toward customer disruptions"", then being told the new policy is that ""customers are disallowed from talking or shrieking during the movie"", which doesn't really clarify where things stand with regard to whistling, and leaves you wondering why the group in the row ahead of you is still allowed to belch loudly every 30 seconds, which seems just as disruptive.


Edit: I guess **the tl;dr point I'm trying to make here** is that, far from being this ""outside case that no one could have considered"", racist subreddits were one of the stated reasons for these changes. Their update to a written policy to describe what was prohibited, and how they would react, does not actually clarify their rationale, which is silly, considering they were clearly aware of what they felt was acceptable, and were trying to write something to justify their gut reaction.",False,False,1438821316.0,4895,17,1270166871.0,False,True

Lolicon (ロリコン?), also romanised as lolikon or rorikon, is Japanese discourse or media focusing on the attraction to **young or prepubescent** girls. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolicon)

I should hope I don't need to link to a dictionary to describe that prepubescent means under the age of adulthood, thus making them children.

That subreddit posts specifically nude and sexual content regarding ""lolis"" (it says so in the sidebar) - which are underage children, and thus, child porn.

Now, before you go and spout off ""But FloppyDingo! Lolicon is legal in the united states!"" - **no it's not**.

The specific law is here (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1466A) 18 U.S. Code § 1466A - Obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children

And specifically states it is illegal for:

Any person who, in a circumstance described in subsection (d), knowingly produces, distributes, receives, or possesses with intent to distribute, a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting, that—

(A) depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in graphic bestiality, sadistic or masochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; and
(B) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value;

In a lot of lolicon and shotacon pornography, the participants are of age, if not hundreds or thousands of years old canonically. And are clearly consenting to sex in the material and are often even the ones with power in the situation.

But aside from that. There is nothing involuntary, because the characters aren't real, and don't have an age.

How do we decide who is an underage anime character? The age they are canonically stated? If so, that treats the author's statements as awfully important, when fictional characters don't have ages. And fans also have a say in what a story means. 

And also, if that's true, a lot of lolicon and shotacon pornography should be allowed here, since there are many adult lolis and shotas. There's a big huge number of animated lolis and shotas who are stated to be adults. In this case, the word ""loli"" and ""shota"" means 'young looking'. Loli and lolicon are actually really broad terms to the fandom, and many define the term loli as a body type, not an age.

So if you ban any subs with the name loli, or sad to be about loli content, that means you're defining what the term means, for the fans. And the majority of fans don't mean the term to mean ""underage girl"" anymore, they mean it to be a body type.

Also, if it's not about age and is about being ""underage looking"" where do you define what is too underage looking? What body types are okay? What body parts are okay? Can sexualized female characters be short? Can they be flat chested? What cup size must they have before they're ""animated child porn""? What hip size must they have before they're ""animated child porn""? How short can they be before they're ""animated child porn""? How round and flat can their face be before they're ""animated child porn""?

Reddit has become not just a website, but essentially an entire means of communication, like telephony or email, allowing types of communication and collaboration that are possible through essentially no other means. It may have primarily been the brilliance of Reddit's system for organizing information that allowed it to become so popular in the first place, but once it became so popular, much of it's value as a tool came from the vast number of people who already used it.

So long as Reddit stayed true to the free speech principles that used to guide it, it's difficult to imagine how any website that offered users the same set of tools could have gained a foothold to compete with Reddit and fracture the userbase; there would have been no reason for any substantial group of users to migrate away from Reddit, and strong reasons for them not to.

If advertisers wanted to tap into the huge group of users participating in the forms of communication that Reddit allows, there would have been nowhere for them to go but Reddit. Even if some of the content in some of the subreddits disturbed them, they would have felt that they had no choice.

But with this trashing of Reddit's free speech principles, Reddit Inc. has given users a reason to migrate away. Time will tell if this migration to Voat and other Reddit-like sites may constitute a critical mass that will allow them to seriously compete with Reddit, but it's ironic that in implementing policy changes with the goal of getting more advertising revenue, Reddit Inc. may given have itself competition that in the long term will result in it having access to a dramatically lower amount of advertising revenue.",False,False,1438906965.0,10127,647,1322640908.0,False,True

Let's unpack some of the important pieces of content contained in the term *child porn*. This will let us take a look at why we find *CP* so horrifying:

1. When real children are used, they are being hideously hurt and abused and traumatized forever.
2. There is often - though not always - human trafficking involved. Which is awful when adults are trafficked - and these are children.
3. People who consume child porn (but don't make it), are pedophiles by sexual orientation (whether or not they've acted on it or not), and we tend to feel disgust toward them.
4. Sexual abuse of children triggers our [emotional disgust](http://www.moralfoundations.org/) response.

So now, let's consider how *Child Porn* created without actual children compares to *Child Porn* created *with* actual children.

Real child porn (using actual children) hits the 4 concerns listed above. Virtual child porn (created without real children) only hits concerns 3 and 4 above.

Individuals who use Real Child Porn (RCP), but don't create it, and individuals who create and/or use Virtual Child Porn (VCP) both hit concerns 3 and 4. RCP users may incentivize others to commit concerns 1 and 2, but don't do those things directly.

This is absolutely true. SRS is certainly hateful, though. Not because of their views (which I agree with more often than not), but because, well, they're hateful people.

It is certainly very possible to have a community that fights to dispel racist, sexist, or otherwise harmful views *without* taking joy in harassing and hurting people. /r/SRSDiscussion is a good example of this; despite the similarity of the name, the style of discourse there couldn't be more different from SRS. SRSDiscussion encourages sane, reasonable, polite discussion, where SRS actively works to suppress thought and encourage fanatical, unreasoning hatred.

I don't think SRS should be banned (unlike CoonTown, I don't think their brand of narcissistic rage translates to significant real-life harm), but I certainly think they should be ashamed of what they've become.

I'm far from being well versed in the whole history of the gamergate event(especially beyond the first week or so), but the problem lies in there being strongly biased people on either side both trying to manipulate perception of the other side. A lot of people simply don't like Zoe Quinn for being a manipulative person, but the opposition would try to call that dislike misogyny where it's just not liking a manipulative individual.

The problem is further deepened when actually misogynysts join the hate brigade and thus the group as a whole gets painted as misogynystic when a lot of people a) don't like manipulative people and b) are concerned with the lack of integrity in the journalism and the bullying tactics it is using.

A line is drawn in the sand and a lot of people who are more or less in the middle choose a side and get painted as extremists. No doubt there is shitty people on either side. Somehow you can no longer be both egalitarian and demand responsible journalism, you have to choose a side. That makes no sense to me and it pisses me off.

Much of this list, I agree with you on. However, some of it, I don't. For example, /r/furries. It is _literally_ a redirect to /r/furry, and /r/furry _explicitly states_ in their rules that porn goes to /r/yiff.

Here's my list and my reasoning as to why you're wrong:  

* /r/furries / /r/furry: Reasoning explained above.  
* /r/yiff: Is anthro porn. Not beastiality. And it isn't illegal, unless that's changed since the last time I checked.  
* /r/dragondildos: Isn't NSFW. I'm starting to wonder if you even clicked on some of these links.  
* Pretty much all of the clopclop subreddits: Is cartoon, and MLP. Again, I don't think that it's illegal.

>Why should reddit allow some shitty users to take up any of their time?

 - Who took up the time? Was it the users of the group, or the people complaining about the group? This seems to be an important issue if you are going to hang your hat on the time issue. Now, if it turns out as many of us suspect that it was the people complaining about the sub's, then are you still going to stand firm and suggest those that wasted the admin's time (aka the complainers) get banned? I suspect not, I suspect that you don't care about the rules, or the equality under the rules, you just wanted a group of people gone, and don't give fuck-shit about how it happened. 

>Why are so many people upset that a small portion of this website is no longer able to post in one section of this site? 

 - Not sure how many more times it has to be pointed out to you and your cohorts, but it isn't about that sub, it is about the equal application of rules. 

> This is a website. Free speech is not guaranteed here.

 - Are you being intentionally obtuse? This isn't about free speech either. It is about the equal application of rules. Got it? Good. 

>God, so many people jump to defend the shittiest people for anonymously posting shitty stuff. 

 - No body is defending them, they are pointing out correctly that reddit had to break their own rules to remove a sub that hadn't broken any rules themselves, and all it takes to get a group of people banned is to yell, scream, whine and cry to the admin's long enough and blamo they're done. If you can't see an inherent issue with this, then I don't know what to tell you, other than you are the problem. 

> They're cowards hiding behind usernames on a website. 

 - I'd say the real cowards were the ones that went (presumably) whining and crying to the admins because their feel-feels were hurt that other people, in a seperate subreddit were saying/posting things that they didn't like, but also didn't have to see or engage with. Merely knowing that those people existed somewhere was just too much for their little feelings and so they had a temper tantrum.

Help me out here please. In the content policy you define bullying as ""Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation"". I would say if someone is posted on SRS the sole purpose it shame and bully that person for the comments they are making (rightfully or not). I would say that fits under this definition does it not? 

Also, was fatpeoplehate not banned for this exact behavior? We've seen SRS publish a list of usernames targeted at particular subreddits, wouldn't that also be a tool to help make this harassment and bullying easier?

Your policy specifically says you're banning subreddits who's purpose is to ""exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else"".  That is **LITERALLY* the purpose of /r/ShitRedditSays.  Nothing more. It is that subreddit's purpose to the core.  But somehow convinced yourself again that they're not.  You just think they're some downvote brigade and thinking of some technology to handle it?

I honestly don't disagree with just about everything you've done so far and I like the improvements to the community, but I really question the motives behind how for time and time again you and your crew (including /u/kn0thing) have blatantly ignored the purpose of SRS.  Your new policy of banning subreddits is 100% the purpose of SRS, and you've completely ignored this.  Instead you're saying the brigading, doxxing, ""annoying"", and ""making reddit worse for everyone else"" is not allowed by *anyone* on reddit........... except for SRS.  

I'm not calling them out, because honestly I think it's somewhat funny watching that drama. But I'm really just confused here.  I mean, I remember a few years ago (when it was still a little of the ""wild west"" of reddit) a novelty account member who really just dove through a user's history and replied to comments to piece together who that member was completely by that freely available public information.  That's a huge part of SRS, and a member commented up top about how they did that to him.

I don't get it.  I'm not saying to ban it or ban the members specifically - I'm just wondering the justification as to how they've constantly avoided every single new policy that when I see it I think ""ahhh the fun of SRS is finally over - this has to be the exact reason for this policy, there's no other reason"".  Then I go in to see that not only is it not banned, but you and your coworkers have ignored it like a sleazy politician who thinks if they can just ignore something it'll go away.

This is a problem.  The longer you act like it isn't there, the longer it'll hurt you.  Address it - that's all.  Address why SRS doesn't fall under **EVERY** policy.  It's probably the #1 question/concern you can see for every policy change as to why it doesn't apply to SRS.  Not, ""we're working on technology"", because that's kind of weak when they explicitly violate almost every policy, but they get a free pass.  Instead of handing it a ban like other subs get, you're just throwing your hands in the air with ""OH WELL!"" and thinking technology will take care of it - you can't even get a decent search. What makes us think you'll get a good data analysis engine to shut down downvote brigades? EVEN IF YOU DO, that still doesn't address how they've avoided clear policy violations for years.

At this point, I'm losing faith in you..... fast.  /u/kn0thing was somewhat of an entrepreneur I looked up to in how to handle things in a case study versus how shitty Kevin Rose handled digg. I'm questioning that now. Not completely because of this, but because of many small things over the past few weeks. And once again, having a completely irrational and confusing stance on SRS.

You're of course not going to say ""hey brigade this post"", I don't think that has ever happened, that isn't the definition of brigading I don't think. Brigading is having multiple people go to a linked post and them voting on it, the brigade doesn't need to be stated, more implied, and with nature of SRS it is clearly heavily implied. 

Years ago when I first joined Reddit I was shadowbanned for apparently ""brigading"" by voting on a link that was top on /r/videos. According to Reddit I was brigading, I didn't know what that was, and no one told me to, I just followed a link to Reddit and thought ""gee thats dumb"", or ""thats good"" and voted. 

By that occurrence of me being banned for ""brigading"" shows that Reddit doesn't use your definition of ""brigading"" needing the users have to be told to ""go here and vote"". I followed a posted link to Reddit on Reddit, and voted, that is their definition of brigading. 

SRS link to comments they do not like, and lucky for us you broadcast the original karma of the comment, so we can see when something magically gets mass downvoted in 2 hours, sometimes days after it was made, and after previously being in positive karma. 

It isn't always, but it does happen. To say people from SRS don't vote/brigade is naive, in a truly logical world yes SRS would leave comments alone they deem as shit, or even upvote them so people can see the ""shit"" people say. But then SRS isn't logical, its bunch of people on a site the majority seem to hate, making posts and comments about comments they hate....

Now lets move on to income inequality and poverty.  Once again let's make a DIRECT comparison. Among racial and ethnic groups, African Americans had the highest poverty rate, 27.4 percent, followed by Hispanics at 26.6 percent and whites at 9.9 percent.  Now this is quite telling but DOES NOT tell the whole, honest truth.  First, let's break down the math a bit.  

 - There are 318.9 million people living in the US.
 - Blacks make up 13% of the population.  41.45(13%)million are black.  11.37(27.4%) million of these blacks are poor.  
 - Whites make up 63% of the population.  200.9(63%) million are white.  19.88(9.9%)million of these whites are poor.

Clearly you can see there are more whites living in poverty than blacks.  This throws the poverty and income disparity out the window.  BUT WAIT...there's more.  Did you catch it?

If you look closely you can see the REALLY immoral skewing of the truth.  Notice in the crime statistics (pulled directly from the FBIs sources) there are NO hispanic murderers.  Odd.  Where did they go?  I'll tell you.  They magically became white.  That's right the FBI considers Hispanics to be white when they account for murders.  So, let's do the fair thing.  If Hispanics are white when we tally murders, then they must also be white when we compute poverty.

- Hispanics make up 17% of the population.  54.2(17%)million are hispanic.  14.4(26.6%) million of these hispanics are poor.  
- Adding the (hispanic) whites we come to a total of 34.29 million whites living in poverty.

So we have 11.37 million blacks living in poverty and 34.29 million whites living in poverty.  

**The conclusion is there are more than three times as many whites living in poverty as blacks yet we STILL commit less murder.**

http://stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/poverty/  

Edit:  

I could go on to show you that doing direct comparisons of income levels, blacks STILL commit far more murder--even among the rich.  However, I don't have the sources on hand and don't feel like searching.  As you can see though, these numbers are not lies and ARE NOT based on bias.  IN FACT, it is borderline criminal to include hispanics as whites when it's convenient to paint a picture of white crime but NOT do the same when you focus on poverty.  This happens again and again.  I guess that's just another conspiracy though.  

Next time you want to do a comparison.  Pretend hispanics are black (but only when it makes you look worse) and see how you feel.

Having said all this, I don't hate blacks.  I just want you folks to admit the truth.  In the end, we're going to need to work together because it's the rich that are out to take everything from poor whites and blacks.  Things like #blacklivesmatter where you exclude whites or these (violent) protests over obvious criminals and absolute thugs that are killed by police only enrage whites that once weren't so racist.  I have been entirely pushed over to the racist side by this shit.  I think if the initial protests hadn't been violent then I would have actually been on your side back then. 

**Still, for me it's a temporary hatred.**  For as much as I hate you right now and I am pissed at blacks for doing this, in my heart, **I still love my black brethren.**

The truth is, we're both just really mad at each other right now but I think it will pass.  Until then, enjoy calling me a racial slur and I'll enjoy calling you a racial slur.

Just because a private company has the right to censor itself and it's users/supporters, doesn't make it right.

This site was built on these freedoms, and now that it doesn't rely on it's users as much, they've abandoned those principals in favor of corporate sponsorship and severe censorship.

If they break the rules, you ban them. If they haven't... ban them anyway because they expressed an opinion someone, somewhere might be offended by?

Lolicon (ロリコン?), also romanised as lolikon or rorikon, is Japanese discourse or media focusing on the attraction to **young or prepubescent** girls. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolicon)

I should hope I don't need to link to a dictionary to describe that prepubescent means under the age of adulthood, thus making them children.

That subreddit posts specifically nude and sexual content regarding ""lolis"" (it says so in the sidebar) - which are underage children, and thus, child porn.

Now, before you go and spout off ""But FloppyDingo! Lolicon is legal in the united states!"" - **no it's not**. It's ""legally grey"" (as listed under https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_cartoon_pornography_depicting_minors#United_States) but people *still go to jail for it in the United States*. 

The specific law is here (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1466A) 18 U.S. Code § 1466A - Obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children

And specifically states it is illegal for:

Any person who, in a circumstance described in subsection (d), knowingly produces, distributes, receives, or possesses with intent to distribute, a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting, that—

(A) depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in graphic bestiality, sadistic or masochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; and
(B) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value;


**Now I'm sorry if this upsets you.** I'm sure people think their hobby of collecting cartoon pedophilia is perfectly innocent but it is, in fact, illegal and you can go to prison for it no matter what you believe on the internet.

So yes, it needs to be at least quarantined, if not outright banned.

I am the whitest urban prog-liberal I know and have black friends. I've had a black girlfriend. Never honestly gave it any thought. But any time that I try to discuss black against white racism that I have experienced I am shut down with ""you really sound pretty racist."" I try to frame it as a cultural problem rather than a racially-based one, because I think that's true - but it's still as if I'm trying to dress up and hide my racism for some people.

I've had three really disturbing attacks happen to me because I was white. One was a guy who chased me for miles by car after he thought I cut him off in traffic. I was 50 feet in front of him. He followed me to a parking lot of a grocery store (I figured safety in numbers), and when I rolled down my window a bit to ask wtf his problem was he said ""get out of the fucking car so I can gut your cracker ass!"" and I saw he was holding a screwdriver. I peeled outta there fast and barely managed to lose him. This happened in my neighborhood so I basically hid my car behind my house for weeks, afraid he'd find me again.

The second time I was just driving through the neighborhood again, and I pulled up to a traffic signal behind another car. A guy comes flying out of the driver's side, telling me to ""back your dumb white ass up!"" while smacking my closed window repeatedly with his fist. I was never closer than a full two feet behind his car. Someone was pulling out of a driveway and I was trying to give them some room. 

He only backed down because people started honking when the light went green. Again, I was pretty traumatized by it. But every person I told the story to was like ""well, black people have been through a lot of oppression."" So basically: my feeling traumatized is just an indulgence; I *am* white, after all.

Third time: another part of the city. Turning right at like 2 mph, slowly creeping up to (but not nearly into) the crosswalk, when a young black male runs up and slams his two palms onto my hood and says ""back the fuck up, you white-ass pice of shit! Get outta the car so I can fuck you up!"" Ugh. 

But none of this behavior is viewed as racist somehow. The fact that I am white invalidates my distress at being attacked for being white. My discussing it, though... well, that makes *me* the racist. 

None of these incidents could be prevented because *I didn't do anything wrong.* I now carry police-strength pepper spray in my glove box. Next person who attacks me is gonna get a face-full. I don't care what color they are. I am not going to be victimized this way again. I'll probably get a bullet in the head.

In any case, I don't really know if anyone has been able to show definitively that it is the advent of internet *porn* that has caused the downturn in the incidence of rape – have a look at [this chart](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/rape-rates-765535.JPG).

You see that the rate was increasing till around 1993, when it started to fall. 1993 was the year when the web started to come into effect and everyone started getting online (me included). Of course, porn became, thenceforth, instantly and *privately* available.

Previously, there was a barrier to getting porn – embarrassment. You had to at least go to an adult bookstore, and for many, the shame of it was prohibitive.

So, there is at least a correlation between the decreasing incidence of rape and the easy availability of porn. However, perhaps it wasn't the porn, maybe it was just the entertainment and *community* (social inclusion) aspect of the internet that did it – even social outcasts could then start making friends more easily.

In any case, some other thoughts. Rape is risky. Why do it if you can just masturbate easily? Is rape about power? I don't know. I guess in my sickest fantasies, my phantom victims of my rampant raping tend to be those who would suffer the greatest humiliation, so that's about power. But, whatever.

Another thing – sex itself is about power, about domination and submission, it's built into our genes, so I suppose rape is also about power in that way.

A trivial work around is to have two bots designed to check each other. The two bots post, then look for the other bot's post. If it's not there, then that bot is shadow banned. If neither are visible both are shadow banned. They then create two new accounts and off they go again.

There isn't even a CAPTCHA of some sort to ensure a human is making the new account.

This site is *designed* to make spamming as easy as possible, so it's definitely not about protecting this site from spam.

Personally, I use the RES account switcher to periodically check that my comments are still visible to other users. It's that easy.

EDIT: It just occurred to me that you don't even need two bots. Spambot logs out. Spambot attempts to view its own user page. If  the page is ""not found"", Spambot creates new account and begins posting. Done.

The fact that the entire user account is hidden from every other user makes it even easier to detect when you've been shadow banned.

But it sure helps to make sure no one can read the comments that got a user banned. The purpose of shadow banning is obviously not about preventing spam, but disguising censorship. There are no ""banned"" users, because shadow banned accounts can still post.

But the very existence of that account, and its history, are hidden from everyone else. ""What banned user? I don't see any banned user? That account never existed!"" 

Here is the user page of a shadow banned account.

Both Emily and Kurt said don't publish this thing. And after they died they were published. I really appreciate the work Emily did. It gave voice to my depression and anxiety. I didn't know that she didn't want it published. 


But now that I know? I think the disrespect of the deceased wishes outweigh the benefit I'd gain from reading it. 

I feel that how we treat the dead says a lot about ourselves and how we view the living. 

Honestly, after I die I'd probably be down with getting smoked in marijuana joints, Ala Tupac. Since that is very unlikely and I don't think I'd get a Tibetan sky burial either. 

So... Maybe donate my body to science. And also, if I can help someone get off.. I think I'd be okay. As long as my family never learns of it. I know that it would crush them. 

Those are only my thoughts. It's a very interesting quandary. ",False,False,False,126397,25516,1312827969.0,False,False

>After losing her vampire powers, Shinobu falls into a long period of stupor. She is frequently seen in Oshino's place with her hands tucking her knees in, her face always in an emotionless state; she often spends most of the day in one spot, doing mostly nothing. Shinobu also does not talk to anyone, but she is familiar with Koyomi Araragi and Oshino, and she would follow requests from either of them without hesitation.
>During *Nisemonogatari*, however, she reveals a much brighter personality after ""reconciling"" with Koyomi. She is rather talkative, and often asserts her superiority through her archaic speech, although it is mostly playing with Koyomi's tendency to act as the follower between the two.

I really do feel like people who down vote posts linked in SRS are entirely missing the point. For one it values karma, the 'reddit credit' or whatever you want to call it, as some kind of valuable resource. SRS clearly shouldn't put much merit into those kind of things, so it's weird to value it by trying to 'take it away'.

I would say the real 'brigading' thing that might disrupt people is either of these:

* Users from SRS clicking through to the linked thread, then upvoting 'good' comments down the thread. I think almost everyone I've known from SRS has done this at some point, just when we see something that looks really well-reasoned it's hard not to sometimes.

* Users from SRS commenting or attempting to comment on the bad post, which can sometimes be very aggressive.

I generally avoid interacting with votes entirely, but I have certainly entered into discussions in the linked threads, especially when someone is asking questions or posting something I feel I could talk about. I think the 'down vote' brigades have at least softened a bit if they did exist in the past, but those two things definitely still do happen. Whether or not they are bad for reddit I can't say. I approve of the stuff that is said, and I don't feel like it's necessarily bad to turn a joke into a conversation about sexism or racism. But I do understand some communities feel like it's an unfair intrusion. So I don't know there. Sorry if this doesn't directly address what you are talking about, but I'm just saying I am aware of what happens in SRS-linked threads sometimes.

If /u/spez responds to ""what did they do wrong?"" with ""they took up too much of our time"", then either ""taking up too much of /u/spez's time"" needs to be added to the rules or something is really amiss.

You are taking the time to write new rules. Write the rules you want, then enforce those rules. Don't write the rules you think we want to hear and then do whatever you want.

If you are afraid that if you write the rules you plan on enforcing, it will cause some kind of exodus of users you need to either accept that those users don't belong on *your* reddit, or you need to seriously look at if the rules you want are what is best for the community.

Some of their ""harassment"" caps are from users with ZERO history of posting to CT (and plenty of history of shitposting to basically everywhere else). Etc.

If there is any chance such an adult could be brought to trial, but the teenager says in court that they were not coerced (lying due to the adult's coercion) and that they did consent, there would be some adulta trying this.

Contrast to facebook - you say the wrong thing and it's inexplicably linked to your person - and people get in butthurt wars over stupid shit that transitions into real life.

And if you have stupid ignorant opinions; you think math is stupid or that all black people are dumb and vaccines aren't real - I WELCOME ALL OF THAT.  Please talk about it - and here!

The best part of that is you have millions of people willing to tell you how stupid your stupid opinions are. 

But when you start to get banned for hating things and expressing your opinions - it spoils the platform.

Let's take a specific example - *you're a white teenager from a white suburbia town and lived a happy & safe, if somewhat sheltered life.*

 *Now you run into this brown guy.  He smells funny, talks in some hurka-durka language, writes funny, wears weird robes and a scary-looking turban.*

When you grow up, you learn there are reasons and significance for those appearances and mannerisms, but we're not there yet.

*So you post about how creepy it is having the guy around, and how bad he smells, and you get permab&.  WTF*.

To me, that's pretty awful.  It's natural to be averse to strange things and smells and appearances.  Fear of the unknown is *literally* human  nature - and I mean literally.

But when you pick and choose what you're ""allowed"" to say and ""allowed"" to post - you're really saying ""*you're not allowed to feel those feelings here*"".

And that's what really ruins a platform. I come here because this place has awesome content and awesome discussions. It has that because I can express myself, and so can everyone else - which is what generates content.

Going to voat isn't a great alternative because it doesn't (yet) have the content base that reddit has.  But that content base wasn't built on ""*let's regulate the content to make sure it's marketable to big box advertisers*"" - it was built on ""let people be people"".  

And losing that pillar is what really hurts.  It has to be obvious from the recent uproar how opposed the community is to these ""moral police"".  

I was an editor and mod for an old social media site *Shoutwire*.  It was a really cool platform, but you've probably never heard of it.  The adult spin-off Spankwire still exists, but that has gotten so awful I don't even want to link it.

I watched the ""suits"" run Shoutwire into the ground, and it was the most painful feeling I've ever experienced on the internet.  When I started, our priorities were a content push - write more stuff, post more links, start some discussion. Invite people to the IRC channel.

Then came the dreaded ""parent company"" buyout.  They gutted the leadership.  Promoted the guy who was famous for his ""*list of N things that are awesome*"" type posts to run the site.

*Numbers numbers.  We can fit another banner on this page.  Talking ads? Readers will love that.  Hey you, how come you didn't post more links to other web 2.0 sites? Don't mention Digg or reddit, we don't want to promote our competitors*.

Above are snippets of ACTUAL conversations of crap they tried to push on us.  They had two priorities - one, spam for more hits; two - maximize ad revenue per hit.

They were tailoring the content to make it friendly to advertising, and trimming the stuff that didn't make money.  In just the same manner, Fox News ruined MySpace.

In that last year, I've seen this exact same thing happening to reddit.  I've been a member for a long time, and lurked for years before that.  I love this site, but this overaggressive ""white-knighting"" is just ruining the content base.

You can smell the undertones - 

* Investors want growth  
* Growth requires going ""mainstream""  
* Going ""mainstream"" predicates getting rid of non PR-friendly stuff  

Craigslist is the perfect example of the site that stayed true to its roots and never let the ""suits"" ruin it.  You hear venture capitalists drooling over how much money they're leaving in the table by not ""monetizing"" - but you know what - they have an awesome service and a loyal base.

Surely some bug execs can come in and beat them then, right?  You have Angie's List.  They have their revenue model, business model, investors, and a plan - what could go wrong?  Except it's a train wreck because it's a bad forum for the end users.

This is a common pattern in tech startups, although lately it's spread far outside of that domain.  Everyone from xerox and ebay to vitamin water and bp use non-capitalized company names.  Even JCPenny now goes by jcp in a number of contexts.

I refer to is as the ""Silicon Valley"" model partly because it first became popular there (lowercase names are visually 'clean', they match web addresses for internet-only companies, and lowercase leading letters are reminiscent of variables in code).  Beyond that, though, the TV show *Silicon Valley* mocked this with the company ""pied piper"" which uses a stereotypical logo of their initials in lowercase.

I mentioned a few fairly legitimate reasons to do this, but I'm mostly annoyed by it.  It's often affected and unnecessary, and it almost always creates confusion (companies like Twitter can't seem to make up their minds, and most everyone varies their capitalization sometimes).  It's largely a ""no creativity in the Valley"" pattern at this moment, and one which has been copied, diluted, and ripped off by massive companies aiming to look innovative and modern.

Other companies guilty of this:

- intel
- at&t
- adidas
- citi
- girl scouts (really? the freakin' girl scouts are going to a ""techy"" brand name?)
- tcby
- mapquest
- virgin atlantic
- nook
- bing
- flickr (also guilty of pointless misspelling)
- hp
- sears

No.

For a private company like Conde Nast or Reddit?

Definitely.

First off think about it logically for a moment. Do you think that an ISP would put their entire reputation on risk because REDDIT asked them to do so?

Also ISPs aren't just know for rolling over when anyone asks them too. Sometimes they can put up a fight against goverments and companies alike.

I am against the ban of Loli Hentai / Cartoons subreddits because I don't feel like it is CP or that it hurts anyone. The characters are not even real, they are fictional. Also like one of those guys said some Loli Girls are ""petite"" and some people are attracted to that.

There is even a thing / meme called Pettanko that means Flat Chested that is a character stereotype in Anime Girls. ( Like people who like flat chested woman or busty womans )

A petite cute flat chested anime girl can easily be mistaken as a Loli.

If you take a look on r/rule34 Top Posts of All Time, there are tons of underage characters being show on sexual ""animated"" images. It has 150k subscribers, so it is in no way a small subreddit.

So guess what, people growing up can have crushs for characters they like from cartoons, animes, games and movies. People have crushs on fictional characters because they like the character personality or how they are presented.

It might happen these characters might be underage because they watched cartoons, played games, watched movies while growing up, so their ""idol crushs"" might be those said fictional characters and you know teenages are horny motherfuckers.

Just like lots of people had crush on Emma Watson during the Harry Potter era, besides her being underage at that time.

I don't really know if Loli Hentai helps Pedophiles reduce their desires. That's why I asked echolocat10n to give a source. Because I would like to have more knowledge so I can give a better opinion on this discussion.

And I think lots of people were upvoting those who are against the censorship because they don't consider Loli Hentai the same thing as Child Porn. They know how to differentiate Fiction from Reality just like people can differentiate GTA from Real Life. So they think that the censorship is dumb since Loli Hentai doesn't actually hurt anyone.

I also feel that the Admins from Reddit were not transparent about this ban, for example they didn't say what subreddits were banned. 
 I wish they were more transparent on what they banned instead of just listing a few Racist Subreddits that got removed and not them all.

Not everyone looked up to Dylan roof as a rolemodel. You clearly are oblivious to what coontown is or else you would have known that mods came out and denounced dylan roof. We dont support his actions as violence is not the way to go. Almost all of coontown including myself condemned him excluding a few of the more extreme members.

>It's funny that you say I'm the one living in a fantasy world when coontown members think the holocaust is a Jewish conspiracy.

Not true. Most members really didnt even talk about jews at all. The sub was dedicated to blacks and we actually invited all races and people even blacks and jews to join us and quite a few did believe it or not. I dont know where you get all your info from but its clearly wrong. There werent very many discussions about jews I mean for fucks sakes the subreddit is called coontown not kiketown.

Not all of us advocate segregation. I dont hate all blacks as we had many active members in the community who were minorities myself included. Im hispanic btw and we had many black members as well. I only hate worthless blacks (and any race for that matter) that leech off of others and feel like they deserve special treatment. They dont work or contribute to society in any way. But are the biggest contributors of crime.  They are protected by the media and most people because it isn't politically correct to speak out against them even when they are in the wrong. I think thats fucking stupid and we need to get rid of all this politically correct bullshit. But the main reason why I joined coontown was to piss off sensitive and retarded SJW's like yourself who are clueless to most things and ignorantly jump on the hate train.

This doesn't change the fact that the idea and concept of free speech is still a thing. And by all measures of fairness, Reddit has shown that it does not support those concepts and philosophies.

Nobody had to look at it. But ideology and ideas are now being enforced. Thought is being enforced.

For blacks to reach the population levels of whites you would have to multiply their numbers by 6.15.  
For whites to reach the poverty levels of blacks you would have to multiply their poor by 2.04.  

Currently blacks murder 4379 each year.
Currently whites murder 3799 each year.


Now let's compare the murder numbers when everything is equal.  With both populations being equal at 255.1 million and their poverty rates being 27.4% whites would kill 2.04 times as many people or 7750.  Blacks would kill 6.15 times as many people or 26,930.  In short with population and poverty rates being the same, blacks would murder 3.47 times more people than whites!!!

Next time you want to argue bullshit, try doing it with someone that doesn't COMPLETELY understand the math.

As far as your silly Hispanic arguments, it really doesn't matter, I was simply showing that many times the white numbers are boosted to appear greater than they are.  I included hispanics as whites in this since, in the links I provided they are included in the white murder numbers.  It's called consistency.

As far as ""judging"" them goes.  I don't give a damn about who they are and they don't give a damn what I think.  I just want them to stop killing so many whites honestly.  Now that you can call racist because I've lost hope in them killing each other and as much as they sling shit our way, I don't really care anymore.  Here are ""racist"" stats on that.  
http://i.imgur.com/l8YTvcU.jpg


Edit:  Ahh, I see, the FBI link does list hispanics.  It's in a frame and you have to scroll it horizontally to see it.  I apologize I was wrong there.   I am very use to many sources lumping hispanics in with whites.   Let's adjust the numbers as I want to be completely objective.

For blacks to reach the population levels of whites you would have to multiply their numbers by 4.84.  
For whites to reach the poverty levels of blacks you would have to multiply their poor by 2.77. 

Currently blacks murder 4379 each year.
Currently whites murder 3799 each year.

With both populations being equal at 200.9 million and their poverty rates being 27.4% whites would kill 2.77 times as many people or 10,523.  Blacks would kill 4.84 times as many people or 21,194.  So with population and poverty rates being the same, blacks would murder at a rate greater than 2 times that of whites.  Not a violent people at all are they?

 - Easy on the funny stuff pal, I'm in a relationship. ;-) 

>Here's the thing, this attitude is like an angry teenager complaining that the world isn't fair. Surprise!!!! It's not, like I said, Reddit is a business, the reason they don't ban SRS is because while they might break the rules, the world outside doesn't care.

 - Here is the thing - you keep missing the point. And they will care, and do care or did you miss this 19 thousand post thread with people ""not caring""? Also, when those ""bad"" ideas aren't contained and out in the default subs, even the advertisers will care - so not only have you (and reddit) missed the point of all these people ""not caring"", but also have made it worse for all parties. 

>Here's the thing, this isn't a court of law, there is no constitution. 

 - How do you continually miss the point, even after it has been spelled out. Multiple times. ??

>People like you are the one's who's ""feel-feels"" are getting hurt. Look at all of you, whining, complaining, sometimes downright throwing temper tantrums.

 - Maybe we should have taken it to the admins in PM messages? No, wait, that is what ""all of you"" did isn't it. Stop your projection. 

> Look. If the US government comes in and says ""let's ban racist speech"" I'll be the RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, arguing that to protect any speech you need to protect all speech. 

 - I doubt that very much. You can't get a little bit pregnant son. 

> But Reddit is a private space, they have every right to orient their website as they see fit (welcome to capitalism).

 - I agree that they can do what they want under their own free will. Yet this wasn't done under their own free will it was the whining and crying of the usual SJW and PVU, but worse than that this decision has made it worse as, and yet again, it hasn't and can't help anyone only make things worse because now they will be in the default subs talking about it instead of all collected and contained as they were before. Read that as many times as you have to until you get that through your head. 

Reddit has just made, yet another in a long string of, bad mistakes by listening to those that scream loudest. There was once a time when reddit was known as the smartest place on the internet, that was destroyed in 09, and it has steadily become more and more of a SJW echo chamber as they cry, whine and have collective temper tantrums at free discussion.

>and vast majority of interracial crime is indeed black on white, not backwards. 

You actually said that without backing it up. Unbelievable.

Here, let me help: [Here's the standard issue statistic](http://2kpcwh2r7phz1nq4jj237m22.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NCFS-Table.jpg). Oh shit, look, more white people are attacked by black people then vice-versa! Reverse racism! (Never mind that we are told nothing about the motivation for these attacks; it just *has* to be racially motivated, I guess.)

Except looking at raw numbers here is misleading and dishonest. And dumb; as if white and black people make up equal percentages of the population. How about let's look at percentages of the population that are victims of interracial crime?

Let's see, [in 2013](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html), there were 316,497,531 people in the US. 77.7% of which are white, 13.2% of which are black. That makes white America a population of ~245,918,582, and black America a population of ~41,777,674.

So, according to that table: 

~560,600 white Americans were victims of interracial violence, making up **~.228%** of white America's population. 

~99,403 black Americans were victims, making up **~.238%** of black America's population.

Did you see what just happened there? That's right, a citizen of black America is *more likely* to be assaulted by a white person then vice-versa. Strange how it's never presented that way, right?

So now you can stop spreading that stupid talking point, right?

And to all the people who upvoted you: Fucking shame on you. Seriously. This is the kind of dishonest ""statistics"" white supremacists use constantly, and it's really easy to debunk.

Of course not, but they paint it that way. Or at least make it seem like they're trying to avoid potential legal actions etc. 

When you say you're banning 'animated cp', people think ""Oh, CP is illegal, good on reddit"". So they can get away with it easier.

As for hate speech. A bit harder to pass off as trying to avoid illegal stuff, but since hate speech is illegal, they can try the same thing. Plus you can start spinning hate speech as ""harassment"" so... 

It's just a pseudo political game reddit is playing. And they're winning. While most of us users complain, the vocal group claiming to have the moral high ground definitely plays its card very well. 

I mean in all honestly it is pretty hard to defend ""Srs is as bad as coontown"". I mean they aren't. But it's a bit of an err in logic. Since they both do similar things. Coontown 'harasses' black people, and srs 'harasses' the people they don't like.

We suck at fixing disorders. Our methods involve electrocuting the brain or removing parts of it or piling on psychological manipulation that only seems to bury not correct.

Instead, how about we just 'deal with it'? We deal with the mentally handicapped pretty well. We deal with redheads, lefties, and people who like ""Toddlers and Tiaras"". Why not homosexuality and pedophilia?

I'm going to piss people off talking about the two together, because ""letting homosexuals be homosexual"" is safe for everyone, and ""letting pedophiles be pedophiles"" is not. As a society we're starting to agree that it's much simpler and better for the welfare for all to not try to fix homosexuality, but to allow it to exist.

And why do we want to fix homosexuality? Because a society of homosexuals won't  reproduce? That's not true at all. The only reasons people want to fix homosexuality are due to arbitrary religion or disgust, and those simply aren't good enough reasons.

Why do we want to fix pedophilia? Well, first of all, we don't want to fix it, we want to kill it. But why? Because pedophiles acting on their desires seriously harms people and families. We can not allow pedophiles to act on their desires because it is by definition nonconsensual - unlike homosexuality. Like homosexuality though, I suspect were discovering that fixing it is next to impossible, and preventing it even more so. So we need to find a way to safely tolerate and endure the occasional pedophile. Maybe society will determine that the suffering of one pedophile is worth it, and is okay with locking them up as soon as their nature is identified.

Anyway, a snippet from the abstract:

>This study, following the effects of a new law in the Czech Republic that allowed pornography to a society previously having forbidden it allowed us to monitor the change in sex related crime that followed the change. As found in all other countries in which the phenomenon has been studied, rape and other sex crimes did not increase. Of particular note is that this country, like Denmark and Japan, had a prolonged interval during which possession of child pornography was not illegal and, like those other countries, showed a significant decrease in the incidence of child sex abuse.

And the full text can be found here:

http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2010-porn-in-czech-republic.html


I thought it was interesting to note that all forms of crime *other* than sexual crimes increased during the period studied. Whereas sex crimes either remained steady, or mostly dropped, as with the case of child sex abuse.

I don't think this is necessarily conclusive, but it is as least some evidence that availability of CP may actually *prevent* further abuse. It just sucks because this kind of thing isn't exactly easy to study. 

The full text also indicates that as far as (non CP) porn availability vs sex crime rates in general are concerned, the issue has been studied extensively; and it's been repeatedly shown that porn doesn't increase sex crime rates, and may even reduce them.

>Feminism does address things like male suicide, male sentencing, and so on through the lens of discussing how gender roles hurt everyone.

Feminism took the idea of rape culture that was about men in prison where the culture actually surrounds rape and makes it about the rape of women which has been in decline for decades although apparently it's still an epidemic.

I have yet to see much traction on women demanding to be enlisted in the draft to have the ability to vote, get a driver's license, or get local or federal funding for college and other programs (depending on your state.)

Then you have the duluth model which pushed a male aggressor, female victim narrative on police departments.  Oh, do not forget teaching men not to rape.  Instead how about teaching both genders to have discussions about consent and advocate for themselves? 

The problem is Feminism is a fluid idea and each person has this ideal of what it means to them.  I do not have a problem with Feminists who like to have a critical debate and talk about social issues.  The problem I do have is the public policies put into place in terms of child custody, domestic violence, shelters that push an agenda that think women are wonderful and men are awful.  While I totally get the argument that it might not be YOUR feminism, it's the feminism that makes public policy and affects everyone and major social change.

Using the same logic of the rich only caring about the rich, feminists at the top only really care about their rights and their own.  That's why western feminism is criticized about being only for middle class white women who went to college.  That's why instead of talking about issues abroad where you have issues of actual patriarchy and women who have little to no liberty nobody could give a shit.

It's the same reason why there is a focus on women in STEM fields instead of looking at the large differences in lower class jobs.  Where's the marches for women in coal mines and oil rigs?  Pays much better than Child Care and Wait Staffing.  It's about making women better off, not equal.

Here's my opinion - you can't have actual equality without thinking about both genders.  A great example is female infanticide in China.  People talk about how awful it is, but they forget that the couple (50% woman) decide to do it.  Because they know, they're less likely to be taken care of when older because their is a perceived obligation of the male to take care of the family.  http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/china/InfanticideChina.pdf

The solution?  Putting that same obligation on women in all cultures.  When you get the same benefits of being freedom without the risks the involved, that is not equality, that's better.

It looks like that's the standard go-to copy pasta for ""What about SRS?"" that's been constantly trotted out for the past year and a half, so I'll post my rebuttal, link by link, for the last time it was brought up:

&gt; 1) ""Evidence"" of brigading where users who posted comments saying some reprehensible things, like claiming corporate hacking is worse than rape, ended up in net downvotes. There is such a thing as SRS and average redditors agreeing that a comment is dumb/terrible.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) SRD thread about a user being shadowbanned, the context being something about Gawker linking to Tumblr page that doxed some users. No mention of SRS.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Linked thread is about an /r/antiSRS mod being doxed, no mention of SRS. The guy being doxed said that the phone calls he received sounded like teenage boys you'd hear on Xbox Live. Could've been SRS, could've been 4chan.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) From the linked thread: ""Note, it was Adrien Chen of Gawker media who doxxed ViolentAcrez. It was not SRS.""
&gt; 
&gt; 5) I don't have the time to go through a month of IRC chat logs. From what I scanned, there were two instances of SRS users asking for upvotes: one in an SRS thread that was being brigaded by /r/mensrights, and one for a videogame competition charity thread. No doxing. In fact, one of the users in that chat log was pointing out that a /r/mensrights user was trying to dox a woman.
&gt; 
&gt; 6) Jesus, another IRC log? Since the person who put together this list didn't post any evidence of brigading or doxing for this, I'm assuming they didn't actually look through the log for any evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; 7) ""Definitive"" proof of brigading on a user's post that went from +19 to +14.
&gt; 
&gt; 8) ""Definitive"" proof that that doesn't actually prove that admins are complicit in perceived SRS brigading. Some of the links lead back to links previously listed here, making this kind of a recursive citation.

I stopped bothering to go through the list because more than half of the links don't support the claims being made, so there's not much reason to believe the rest will either. The post only appears legitimate because a giant wall of text appeals to the ""\[Citation Needed\]"" mindset of redditors.

This is you being totally disingenuous, and annoying, considering the answer is self apparent:

If you really think that SRS is as much an extreme as /r/C--ntown was, you're not nearly as neutral as you believe yourself to be. SRS is filled with white dudes who ironically say that most white people suck for being super racist and that most dudes suck for being sexist. C--ntown was a sub that literally denied the humanity of all black people, regularly looked forward to a race war where all non-white people would be massacred, and generally existed as a neo-Nazi/white supremacist hide. There's a *huge* difference between these points of view, and it's a complete false equivalency to suggest that they're just ""two extremes"" (unless you just happen to think the progressive extreme is necessarily less awful than the regressive extreme, in which case we broadly agree).

The better comparison would be something like KiA/TiA vs. SRS; I think KiA has a larger tendency to brigade than SRS because SRS's business model means that vote brigading is actually counter-productive, but in general those two are a better match for ""extremes"" and it's more genuine to say that you don't care for either side in *that* battle.",False,False,False,250960,17511,1360216266.0,False,False

Truth be told, I'd be fine if reddit censored the word ""nigger"" to all but 1 subreddit by default. Certain ones could disable the word filter, but at their discretion.

>I have tried to understand it, but can't.

I have some additional insight, but you're going to need to shift out of fighting mode and into conversation mode for it to have any chance of getting through.

First off, let me be perfectly clear... I am not calling you a racist. I have no reason that believe you are racist. But that being said, when you're trying to reassure people that you're not a racist, you really ought to lose the bit about having black friends. [Language like that certainly doesn't help your claim](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Friend_argument).

Yes, there are problems in the black community. Yes, there are racist elements in black culture. But, I don't think it's dismissive or racist for your friends or other progressives to try and explain that there might be differences in how quickly or fully equality is embraced by different cultures. This is especially true when you're comparing historically oppressed minority groups with groups who've lived comfortably in the majority for hundreds or even thousands of years. I imagine that there are environmental conditions that foster (or hinder) cultural valuation of equality and it's easy to conclude that being in a comfortable, dominant position would give a culture the easiest path to enlightenment (if I can call it that). On the other hand, an oppressed population might have a harder time letting go of tribalism and racism. For example, prison populations tend to break down along segregated, ethnic lines. Prisoners live in an inherently insecure environment and survive as part of a clearly subdominant caste. It's not an environment where I would expect inmates to develop a strong sense of empathy for each other or for the guards. Sure, there might be exceptions, but we're talking about the broader cultural aspects.

Does any of that excuse racist behavior by minorities? Of course not. Racism is racism and should be condemned in all forms. But I can also understand how there might be higher expectations for those in the majority, particularly when those expectations are self-driven.

Anyway, regardless of all that, if you're going to discuss the topic, you have to dial back the rhetoric and realize that it's a complex and delicate area where usually, the people treading indelicately, are those on the extremes. ",False,False,False,159478,6765,1221112037.0,False,False

Then there are other works by many acclaimed people that are technically porn, such as Osamu Tezuka's ""Cleopatra"" which, while non-standard for porn in a similar way as the many French works I described, its still porn. And if you exempt non-standard porn that also tries to be art, then you have to find a place to draw the line and argue what makes something art and something not art, which can be very difficicult to objectively determine.

>actual women are harmed in the making of porn

That depends. While that is often the case, it varies from person to person and from work to work. Context is extremely important in such. I suppose you could argue that porn itself is dangerous as it inherently objectifies people thus making all porn bad, but then you have to look at the consequences of objectification and how it affects people, and as you continue to do that it gets into a lot of things that have no clear answer regarding the morality of such and the psychological/sociological impact of such. Plus I think its important to mention that the originally context of these posts is referring to porn that doesn't involve actual real people, which I believe further complicates such and makes your ""actual women"" part of your argument require more detail and information.

>I pointed out that the FSC is a lobbying group for pornographers because that gave context to your quote
Yes, but a person or group's background is not important in deciding whether or not the information being discussed/said by such groups is bad or good information. What's important is the actual thing being discussed.

-------------------------

Fair enough. Your comment motivated me [to look up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country) to what degree hate speech is restricted in other liberal democracies, and from from my American perspective, I found much of that info shocking. I knew that the U.S. had broader protections to freedom of expression than many other liberal democracies, but I didn't realize just how exceptional we were in that respect. So you're right, I should not have appealed to the protections that ""liberal democracies provide"" to free expression in general.

That said, I am an American, and I myself hold the values around freedom of expression that are dominant in my culture. I do feel that all people in all places should have the same rights to express themselves that I enjoy, and that providing those protections to all would have the net impact of serving the public good.

I recognize, of course, that the primary intent of hate speech laws is generally to protect people who could be targets of that speech from harm, and it's undeniable that those laws that have been enacted must, to at least some degree, in fact be successful at doing so. But in my mind, a greater harm is done by restricting that speech, and the net effect on society is a negative one.

If your goal is to protect people from being hurt by hate speech (and perhaps to change people's attitudes that allow for widespread oppression of one or more groups in your society), it seems shortsighted to attempt to do so through directly restricting people's rights to engage in hate speech. While doing so might have some immediate positive impact getting people to stop those behaviors, it also deprives them of opportunities for their attitudes to be challenged and changed.

It also takes away any pressing need for a society to engage in a wider collective dialogue about those issues that could lead to collective growth. It psychologically takes the power out of the hands of the people, and infantalizes the population, making us less capable of acting as responsible and empowered participants in our collective decision-making systems.

I would not be surprised, for example, if denial of the Holocaust would have become less widespread than it is today if it had not been made illegal to do so in 17 countries.

When you restrict a person's right to express a perspective, you're implicitly conveying that you don't believe in the strength of your counterargument to that perspective. And that's something that we shouldn't do, because the argument for treating all people with empathy and respect is a strong one. It's right, not just morally, but in an objective sense. We're trying our hands behind our backs in this fight by not giving ourselves access to opportunities to use that argument, instead relying upon the lesser tool of censorship. One only needs to look at the example of Reddit to see the power of 

So basically, I'm making the argument that, whatever the standards of freedom of expression are in some countries, it is right and proper to protect people's rights to engage in hate speech - in public physical spaces, in published work, and through the forms of communication that Reddit allows, of which, right now Reddit is essentially the only provider.",False,False,1445033437.0,10127,647,1322640908.0,False,True

Normalisation isn't a cut and dry ""crime or not"". Normalisation is a process that affects anything we do regularly. In this case, it normalises a sexual appetite for children, which is unhealthy to the individual regardless if they act out upon it or not, and increases the risk that they might extend this to their actual life.

To me, uneducated in psychology, that sounds as much like a mental illness as depression.

However, this doesn't mean that people who suffer from mental illness are invariably unaccountable for their actions. Their fantasies might be abhorrent, but that doesn't mean their ability to refrain from engaging in them is more compromised than anyone else - I'd hazard a guess that pedophiles are no more likely to act out their fantasies than those who rape adults. My concern would be then that anything that encourages or stimulates this fantasy life might make those who are already more predisposed to enacting fantasies more likely to do so - not so much that it would make someone who truly wouldn't do it to begin with more likely to.

If only to stop the incessant whining that happens every time admins remove one of the subs in question.     
       
The problem is you have a significant group of entitled people who want Reddit to be the Mos Eisley of websites.  Anything goes.  Remove a sub, any sub, no matter how justified or illegal, and this group will be vocally upset (unless, of course, that sub is one they universally loathed).       
        
And when that happens you're essentially crowdsourcing that group to find flaws in your criteria and logic.    And they **will** find them.  Especially when there were clearly other criteria you're failing to mention because if you do you'll be accused of being a hypocrite on the free speech front.     
         
The admins are in a no-win situation.  The site **can't** be anything goes so the worst content needs to go. Reddit users demand clear criteria for removal, but the problem is when you have **so fucking much** content the grey area becomes massive and incredibly undefinable.  Those people who don't think *anything* should be removed have a massive grey source to continually thwart your efforts to give people a clearly defined set of banning criteria.  There will **always** be a sub they can find that breaks that criteria.       
        
So... Don't give them the criteria.  Reserve the right to remove subreddits without having to write a thesis paper explaining why.  Make sure it's all logged and visible and use an incredibly light hand.  Don't get me wrong, criteria would be great and is generally a good sign of transparency, but that doesn't make it executable.  ""This is why we can't have nice things...yadayada"".     
         
People aren't going to like it but I'm willing to bet those demanding clear criteria are the same people who insist on breaking that criteria.

Afterwards there were...Concerns made internally about whether these promises could be delivered on.

Around that time someone - maybe Steve, maybe deimorz, I don't remember - had said something along the lines of ""yes, this is a big issue to tackle, and we don't think this is something we're going to complete this year"", giving some examples of why it was hard.

Yes. And there are only a couple of solutions to that, changing your view (unlikely), lying (depends on your karmawhore level) or going to a niche sub that has the same ideas as you. Or alternatively, 
>If it's so upsetting, then by all means: http://voat.co

The problem that we're facing is that these niche subs in questions, where people have learned that they are better off just staying there with other likeminded people and interacting with eachother (whether it be fph, coontown, lolis, or whatever they decide is the next thing that worships the devil) are being nuked for no reason, hence the backlash from the community.

Out of all the subs that were banned semi-recently, I had never heard of 75% of them, and I'm pretty sure the majority of reddit hadn't either. Because they were being ignored and were hidden, just like downvoted comments. 

Reddit isn't a place for discussion, it's a place to talk about or share stuff that you like, with other people that like it as well. As soon as it gets too controversial or heated, threads get nuked, people get banned, and just recently many communities get banned as well.

I don't understand the reasoning behind banning things that aren't illegal. I disagree with coontown... and that's why I just don't go there, ignore them, and downvote comments that are obviously bait. How is banning their subreddit helping anything at all? It's not going to make them change their mind, it's the exact opposite, they think they won. What the admins are doing is destroying the nest and letting them spread everywhere else and following up with [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wt9zUgSQ7os/T0kZ2NbsUsI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/Voh_sbZceH8/s1600/fingers+in+your+ears.jpg).

Feminism is a century old movement that has achieved many things, and Men's rights is a, although sometimes noble in goals, new movement that hasn't done much, and more importantly, has been co-opted by some of the worst figureheads.

I think he's trying to say that those folks were generating an inordinate amount of complaints and disruptions in proportion to the amount of users and staff on the site. Say you work at a fast food joint and this one guy comes in and starts complaining loudly to people about this and that. Once or twice and it's just the headache of doing business with people. Nope, motherfucker starts coming in *EVERY DAY* causing headaches. Mind you he's only talking, no law against that, but he's pissing everyone off and making people start to bitch to the manager to do something about it. Imagine you're that manager and you have to come in and think about this same dickhead's antics every day and having people trying to grab your attention to field more complaints about this constant nonsense *EVERY DAY*. Exactly at what point would you ask this guy to leave so you can get back to doing the regular restaurant thing and not have to deal with this anymore? And what would you say to this guy if he told you to shut up and that telling him to stop talking was a violation of his freedom of speech? 

Never forget that this place is run by people who have to field complaints and deal with tired, stupid shit day in and day out. Just like most of us who work. If someone or a group of someones is causing enough of a ruckus to actually disrupt the day-to-day dealings that keep the rest of the place moving, what do you expect them to do? 

Now I'm not dissing your opinion or anything, I'm just viewing this as a parallel based on what I've come to understand here. Now selling food and hosting a forum may seem like a comparison of apples and oranges but the general attitude is the same: In normal business practices involving the public, you don't cater to anyone disrupting the normal flow of business, upsetting everyone else just because they can. It might seem like a shit-show but it's their shit-show. All the complaints come to them eventually and they made a decision that, to them, probably looked like it was going to benefit the most people and give them the least amount of headache.

I mean even your screen name is offensive but they haven't banned you for choosing it nor have they restricted you from using it. So you and the other coontowners still have all the same rights you had before coon town got banned the only difference is that reddit isn't going to dedicate some of its server space *ad free* for you to use. So YES effectively you are arguing for a right to use their servers. 


To your second point, that may be true but what I was getting at is that there are a number of confounding variables that must be accounted for. For example most crime occurs in economically disadvantaged areas. Most crime also occurs ethnically diverse areas. Most crime also takes place in areas without a lot of educational opportunity. 


By far in this country no other group lives in worse areas than do blacks. They live in the [most diverse neighborhoods](http://nhi.org/online/issues/147/privilegedplaces.html), they have the [highest unemployment rates],(http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpsee_e16.htm), they have some of the [lowest overall college education rates](http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/2014/Table%203.xlsx), they live mostly in [the hottest and most humid environments which world wide show a higher rate for violent crimes](http://www.censusscope.org/us/map_common_race.html). I could probably come up with more if I thought about it for a minute. But suffice to say the whole ""they have more crime"" is simplistic at best and at worst its not going to try and fix the problem.

 People like you who want to just say ""look how bad they are"" are making this country worse by your complete unwillingness to accept tgat your attitudes are part of what creates the climate for a high crime scenario. So yes, you are technically correct when you say ""blacks commit more crimes.""  But your also losing cite of WHY that might be the case and tgerefore you're not seeing that all the ""problems"" that you are seeing *just may* be fixable.

There still exists all that evidence regarding black people being more prone to violence. Believe it or not, races evolved differently based on their surroundings and needs. Asians cannot consume as much alcohol because they never drank that much of it; they had tea. The chance of being lactose intolerant is based on where your ancestors came from. IQ is based upon genetics as well. Watch the documentary Hjernevask then if you still disagree, we can talk about it.

There's all this evidence that blacks are lesser beings. You have Zimbabwe forcing whites to leave, and then they start starving so the leader asks the white people to come back. By going from white farmers to black, you go from a bread-basket to starving. You have Asian countries doing amazingly, so you can't just blame it on colonization. China is quickly catching up to the USA. So why is Africa doing so poorly compared to Asia?

A huge part of the SJW idea is that circumstances matter. You should be tolerant of a person's flaws which are caused by things outside that person's control. Simply observing that a person has a flaw is not enough to damn them. You have to also understand whether they acquired it by their own actions, or if the environment forced it upon them.
This is why affirmative action is okay: minorities suffer from subtle but very real discrimination issues, so some fraction of their slightly lower performance is caused by circumstance and should not be held against them. 

I completely agree with this idea.

Then you look at how the SRS community treats bigots, and the irony is staggering. Bigotry (racism/sexism/etc) is a deadly sin and there is literally nothing that can ever absolve you. They will not hear you, they will not speak to you, they will not offer any chance at redemption.

Maybe that seems okay if you're from SRS, but consider: what if a person has never been exposed to a contrary viewpoint? This isn't hypothetical. Go find someone who grew up in a racist community and ask them about their experiences. Ask them when they realized that <minority> wasn't really like everyone always said.

Duh, but when you try to use a statistic to warn of risk, or make claims to an incidence rate worth worrying about (which is what you did), absolute number is a really stupid way to go about it.

Have you read the comments on reddit? And even worse...comments on Facebook, major news sites, etc? Now that everyone gets to make a comment, we can see just how deep the ignorance goes, and how often people reject fact to protect their ignorance even when it's right in front of them. Can we agree with just how infuriating that can be? Now imagine if you were the group that ignorance and hate is directed towards. It's the same anger you're feeling right now, but you have the ability to turn away and say, ""Oh well, not my problem. Doesn't really affect my life. I tried to help."" Many people don't have the ability to do that because of things they can't change. The anger builds and builds, and they see it and experience it every day, in their jobs, in their personal relationships, walking down the street, driving their car, etc. 

As someone who is obviously frustrated himself with the anger seemingly directed towards people like him, but wants to help, here's what I would recommend to you: Come to the conversation without a chip on your shoulder, don't list every talking point you read that has already been addressed, don't apologize for anyone who you don't want to be associated with, and ask how you can help...and move on to another conversation if that person is not at a point where they can get past their anger to something more productive. And be understanding that people are angry and may misdirect their anger at times towards people trying to help. You want to help, but you are not in their shoes. Not every person is a nuanced leader in any struggle, and may not say the right thing every time, nor are they responsible to you or anyone else to do so. That does not negate the entire thing.

At the end of the day, even if you can't always have productive conversations with people, direct your anger and frustrations in the right direction. It's not at the people you mostly agree with about equality and social justice. It's the people who are perpetuating the injustices.

Edit: Just to clarify, I am not trying to excuse anyone's behavior. There are plenty of whackos out there and unfortunately they can be loud. I am just saying that extending a little bit of understanding to why someone is angry, and focusing the anger in the right direction, is going to do a hell of a lot more good than turning on each other and dismissing each other's entire points of view.

The action of calling SRS hate speech is being compared to the action of a neo-nazi complaining about the Southern Poverty Law Center.  The subject is ""Redditors who call SRS hate speech/Neo-nazis"" and the action is ""Calling SRS hate speech/complaining about the SPLC"".  What is the analogy between them?  Both groups, according to the OP, call a group which fights hate speech hateful.

The comparison then, is between the two actions, because the people who call SRS a hate group perform a comparable action to neo-nazis who complain about the SPLC.

First they came for the fat haters. Few spoke up because they were not haters of fat people. The ones who did speak up asked why other hate subs were allowed to persist (such as /r/coontown). The PR answer was that fat haters were allegedly doing what SRS does on a daily basis. The real answer is that Imgur was butthurt because they were fat. Since the racists were still allowed to harass the kind folks over at /r/blackladies, it was decided that none of the admins or folks at Imgur were black ladies. Enough stink was finally raised.

So they came for the racists and other hate subs. All racists? Nope. /r/killwhitey is still a community (has gone private). They came for the racists that advertisers wouldn't like. They don't care about places like /r/killwhitey because it isn't en vogue to worry about things like that. 

But wait! All hate subs? Again, nope. SRS is still hating other redditors, going around acting like assholes, vote brigading (the whole point of the sub!), threatening to rape those that disagree with them, and generally being a nuisance to anyone over the age of 16. 

Why do they still exist? Well, a few reasons. They hold acceptable views on what races and genders are always wrong, there's an ex admin running the place, and there are a LOT of eyeballs there to sell to advertisers. Anyway, that's a little off topic, but it is important to note that these people are not banned.

In a truly egalitarian place it wouldn't matter if it were a guy, a girl, black, white, brown, green, orange, or a six armed purple person as long as they were human. All of those people would be treated the same. Reddit is not an egalitarian place. Reddit is a place that sells eyeballs. By leaving up leaked celebrity pics of naked women they will, in the short term, have a HUGE spike but will forever be tarnished and will lose out on those eyeballs over the long term. If it's a guy, no one gives a shit so no reputation will be tarnished. 

That's all fine and good, but they should really update their policy to actually reflect why they're doing shit. I'm alright with someone saying ""We've got to pay for this site, and you're stopping us from doing that"" or ""We just hate your shit, so you've got to go"" or even ""We're fairly sure you smell in real life, and this is our site so we can kick you off because we think you smell"".

To be honest I fundamentally disagree with some of the ideas such as the 'bio-troofs', that borders on 19th century racial psedusoscience. I understand the leap of logic in 'gender dimorphism makes men and women act as fundamentally different citizens', but the effect is not so pronounced. 

However you can read, as an angry MRA, that TRP is about how to handle women are being indoctrinated into the man-hating (especially cis-white-male hating) constantly-oppressed and often downright manipulative SJW/special snowflake mindset (which happens to resemble princess syndrome) and *not* end up getting either cheated on or 'divorce raped'. That is, losing custody of your children, facing child support and alimony payments for the next decade, being labeled a misogynist in the eyes of your and her family and friends, etc. I don't think it's sexist to say that women hold the power in the majority of divorce courts. And male disposability is totally a thing, which a lot of Millennials in particular just don't get thanks to the efforts of militant feminism to claim everything is patriarchal oppression and every man is benefiting from patriarchy. In particular, young men are considerably losing out from an education system which has been taking affirmative action towards young women for the past 2 decades at least, and thus neglects them. These young boys may have already grown up in broken or dysfunctional homes.

Often surviving in this thought-policing environment ironically involves conforming to hyper-masculine ideals and behaviour around women, and even men of this SJW type because of the erroneous double standard of both camps and the immaturity of the people who adopt it. Seriously, with some campus feminists, it is a classic case of ""creepy to speak out if you're attractive, cute to speak if you are.""  We are of the opinion that 3rd wave feminism raised men to be more sensitive, but that this backfired and most women hate it and blame it for the uprising in man-children. We're not sure why which is why we developed the evo-psych. model. Regardless you either have to perfectly resemble patriarchal masculine ideals, or perfectly resemble feminist ideals. It is in fact in this day and age, much easier to resemble the former, since although they're damaging, the goal-posts for the latter change as and when the likes of SRS and /r/AgainstMensRights sees fit. For example, because everyone who disagrees with an SJW or an SJW does not like is either a NIce Guy, a neck beard, a bitter virgin, a shitlord etc. Such an attitude has permeated into more mainstream social media. This is not how it should be, becoming 'alpha' just to avoid double-edged persecution, but in practice we find it's the only way to get a hypocrite's respect. Especially powerful hypocrites who control discourse throughout the media and academia.  

Some of the younger guys exploit this knowledge that they are in fact not oppressors just because they're a cis-white-male, and do go full misogynist for a while through some of the PUA Game theory, though. Drunk with power, perhaps. These are the type who may originally have been objects of ridicule in /r/niceguys; but the thing is, this is a double standard. It's considered laughable by SJWs that men *don't* acknowledge they're being objectified, not just for their looks but their wealth, their status and profession, their conformity to masculine ideas etc.  But at the same time there is an *entire ideology* dedicated to demanding men stop objectifying women in all of its forms. It should not be a one-way criticism. However, as we deal with reality, we teach guys to expect very few people will sympathise with their complaints and instead how to improve themselves to avoid facing such one-sided humiliation just for being the average Joe.

There's again some validity to this in that evolutionary psychology seems to impact a little on inter gender behavioural and sexual attraction even in modern times; YMMV on how far you take this. 

For the most part, we teach young vulnerable boys and disfranchised men how to deal with shitty women and succeed in a world where they are frankly the disposable class. It is a crying shame that to do this many have to preach All Women Are Like That, as it's mostly the result of the hypocrisies of the late 2nd and 3rd wave feminist camp. There are plenty of good, fair women with strong character out there, and a fair few egalitarian-type feminists as well; our vitriol is not for them. It's also horrendous tough love that we must ram this message home into the hearts of so many men to the point they might break down, since we understand that the current generations of women have many who feel that they owe nothing to men while men owe them penance for the sins of their great-grandfather's chauvinism. It is a ridiculous mentality of entitlement from and hostility towards men being bred, self-victimisation which leads many to think such stupid things as it's OK to cheat when one's emotional needs aren't met, in fact it's his fault. There is little security in the modern Western dating scene or even marriage anymore, we help them adapt to that accordingly and get them to stick out for no. 1 before anyone else, because no one else is going to do that for them. 

Soon enough I'm sure they'll quarantine or ban us without understanding our goals are to be a positive influence to these men.

> I'm honestly not even entirely concerned about brigading but if you want to discuss it we can. I'm talking about the systematic targeting of users, and the shaming of their conversations they have on reddit.

You mean calling people out for their actions?

First off, sub rules dictate no touching the poop, so as long as people are following that rule it should be impossible for someone to be harassed through SRS. The comment is posted and discussed but there should be minimal to no interaction between SRS members and the commenter. Strike number one against harassment.

Second, it's not the users being targeted it's their comments. It doesn't matter what else a user has posted. The only requirement is that the *comment* be expressing a shitty view and be highly upvoted related to the rest of the thread it's in. Strike two.

Lastly, since it's comments being targeted, it's unlikely that the same user will have more than one comment 'featured' in a short or even moderately long period of time, unless they're in the habit of often evangelizing for a shitty viewpoint. Since harassment is supposed to be targeted against an individual and systemic and this doesn't fit either of those, strike three.

Now, *users* on SRS have harassed other users in the past, and they've been banned from SRS and the site for it.

There is no assurance of objectivity because they won't and can't be objective. Reddit is a website where people post a link and then underneath that link people write words into a box.

There is no objective measure for the quality of such a site. 

I'm going to guess from your comment that you think banning coontown did not make reddit better. But /u/spez and the admin team think that it did. If some other place becomes a huge hub for reddit racism, they'll probably ban that too.

Their content policy seems to be: some small racist subs are okay/not worth tracking down and banning but if your racist sub becomes a large presence on reddit, we're going to delete you.

* There exist laws in America

Another edit....

I found your latest arrest record:

threaten public official (that would be the DA I assume) and violation of probation which means a prior felony conviction from something a few years before (criminal threat with intent to extort). Both last year were felony arrests. Holy shit, you just got busted out hard, again. What's that about a lawyer, now? 

""My own e-mail header should be proof enough, yet they won't free me. Proven treason. **Kill them at your own convenience**."" (emphasis mine)

""I currently work with my parents in a family-owned cleaning business.""

""Too many idiots out there, and the temptation to just knock the hell out of them is just so strong sometimes.""

""If I want your opinion, **I'll beat it out of you.**"" (emphasis mine)

""I'm now sick of being held hostage and I'm about to fight back and I'm going to fight DIRTY. Both of you can either talk to me, or I bury you.""

Does your probation officer know that you are posting on the Internet for non-business purposes which is a probation condition for you? I went around and archived everything on various websites. See how I just turned this on you? 

This is why you don't around threatening people with violence or otherwise and why attempted extortion is generally a bad idea.

The idea that SRS doesn't mock people is completely and entirely wrong. Literally the second question on their FAQ is ""Q: Why mock people?"", they go on to call them ""these people"" several times, it is not centering around just a comment. They've further proven this by the ""tag"" list. Let's not fool ourselves. 

Continuing with your second point, the defense of ""BUT THEY DO IT TO!"" doesn't work here. Just because someone else did something fucked up doesn't excuse the next behavior. This is just ontop of them admitting it's people they are mocking, not just comments. 

Onto your third comment; That kind of proof just doesn't really exist beyond statistical evidence to say X people on the list experienced X. The people using the list won't admit to using it so we can't ever ""prove"" that. It's only supporting the idea of a continued targeted harassment, instead of a single instance of harassment. 

They have publicly declared their intentions to point out particularly horrible and mock people for their comments on reddit. That is by definition meant to demean someone. There does not need to be ANY other supporting evidence I'm only offering additional to support the reasoning based on their own content post. 

As far as NP links go, it's only additional supporting evidence ontop of the stated reason for SRS to exist. If they truly believed in not touching the comments (or poop as you call it), they would do what most of the other subreddits do and use .np links. They are the only ""large"" subreddit with this exception that I'm aware of, do you know of any others?

>You mean calling people out for their actions?

I mean demeaning people for their comments they make on reddit. I mean breaking this exact content policy that is in place. 

>First off, sub rules dictate no touching the poop, so as long as people are following that rule it should be impossible for someone to be harassed through SRS. The comment is posted and discussed but there should be minimal to no interaction between SRS members and the commenter. Strike number one against harassment.

That's not how this works at all, how this works at all. If you are posting peoples comments to subreddit to MOCK someone, that is bullying and demeaning to them. We've had plenty of stories of people coming forward (with a quick google search you can find them) of past and current offenses. We can say that it's a small subset of users sure, but it still maintains that SRS is a community built around mocking and demeaning other redditors, which this content policy particular points out as breaking the rules.

If it's not users they are targeting why are they going back 4 + years on someones comments to post something about them? Why do they mock PEOPLE in their own FAQ? If someone is going back 4+ years for a comment that's a CLEAR sign of harassment, if that person complaints to the moderator and they are just laughed at, that's a clear example of a subreddit that needs to be banned, and the moderators banned as well for supporting that kind of toxic place. 

To add to this from their OWN current FAQ 

>These people are usually the ones that get up in arms when the tables are turned and they are suddenly faced with the uncomfortable reality of having become an object of scorn and ridicule themselves. It's hilarious. 

They are literally calling it hilarious to mock, scorn and demean someone, if that's not a clear example of a horrible community I don't know what is.

no they don't. They post jokes. Mostly. Or true statements. Current example off the front page:

Look at my [link](https://voat.co/v/Niggers/comments/379954), please. By the way, hating racists *is* having a preconceived opinion. If you are meeting someone you are told is a racist, you're going to go in disliking the person.

>It's not like racial attacks are something just being handed out equally by an invisible force where someone making up 15% of the population receives 15% of racial attacks.

I fail to see what this has to do with anything, but that's an interesting way to look at it. Back to the table: black people make up 13% of our population, but make up almost 15% of the victims. White people make up 77% of the population, but make up only 63% of the victims. You're right, things definitely aren't being handed out equally.

It's funny, because this data is supposed to show white people that we should be worried about interracial violence. It actually just shows that the odds are in our favor, all around.

>Whites and blacks would encounter each other at exactly the same rate 

In a society with an unequal distribution (by about 6:1), that statement makes absolutely no sense.

>so when whites are **5 times as likely** to be attacked by blacks than the reverse it really does mean exactly that.

Oh, c'mon. I just spent a TLDR post explaining that *that's bullshit*. You should read it. From it, you could make a very simple calculation of the odds. (It's pretty much 57:25000 for white *and* black people, BTW.) There's really no excuse to come to this discussion and keep making statements like that.

Just like everyone else who misreads that table, you're stuck looking at overall numbers, but you're not putting them in the context of population distributions. The only thing you can factually say that's close is that 5 times as many white people are attacked by black people than vice-versa, but that's a huge ""duh"" *because there are over 5 times as many white people as there are black people.* That's about what we'd expect to see!

But just for shits and giggles, let's say the number of victims were equal, (which I guess is what you guys expect?) that would actually point to a hugely *disproportionate* (that's an important term here) problem of white-on-black violence.

This is why I made the motorcycle vs. car fatality comparison. By your logic, we should stop riding around in cars, because we're 8 times as likely to die in a car. Once you spot why that statement is nonsense, you'll understand why your ""5 times as likely"" statement is nonsense.

>You are coming off like you are shocked at how stupid he is while failing to comprehend the data yourself.

Says the person who just said ""so when whites are **5 times as likely** to be attacked by blacks than the reverse **it really does mean exactly that**"". I don't think it's me that's failing to comprehend the data. But, by all means, show me where I've fucked up.

Here, I'll give you a couple freebies, because you guys seem to be trying really hard to paint black people as thugs and racists.

First freebie: You *could* say that there are a disproportionate number of black offenders (1.3% of the black population, versus .04% of the white population), but I would counter with we don't know how many of them make up repeat offenders, so we can't really say 1.3 in 100 black people will attack a white person without that information. (Especially considering that it [seems to be that there are a small percentage of criminals who perpetrate the majority of our crime](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109924NCJRS.pdf).) I would also counter that the problem here has way more to do with poverty--[of which black people disproportionately are in](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/)--than ethnicity or skin color. (Which, again, ""duh"", unless you're a raging racist.)

Which segues into my second freebie: We don't know how many of the victims are also, uh, ""repeat victims"", for lack of a better term, so these percentages and odds could skew a little bit with that information.

Totally, one is watching porn, one is rape and harming another. Keep in mind that that study, while it concluded they were '85% of pedophiles in prison' or something like that it probably is a biased population sample as most pedophiles are probably not in prison and those were are a more harmful and/or active subset.

This is just stupid. You're honestly trying to claim that people aren't aware of what they are putting on Reddit? Why do *you* get to determine what people you obviously feel antagonistic towards think is or is not a joke? Would you change your opinion if someone involved actually told you ""IT'S JUST A JOKE?""

If you're sorry for the shit you said years ago, then fucking say so. If not, then fucking own what you wrote in the past instead of being a coward and trying to dodge it while never disavowing it.

If the shit you said years ago is hurtful to bring up now, then look inside yourself and figure out *why that is*.

If you keep on insisting that *your* interpretation is absolutely right, then maybe you need to get off Reddit and go do something to develop your character so that you can recognize when things are satire or joking.

Given the only real relevant response in your previous reply was that you don't like that they used the word ""neo-nazi"", I'm going to point out that ANY choice of group would have attracted just as much ire.  I think we can both agree that the average person does not attack the SPLC as a hate group.  Sure, people do that, but those people belong to groups, they are not just randomly distributed.  You could substitute ""neo-nazi"" for ""KKK members"", or maybe ""racist bigots"", or if you want to be as inoffensive as possible, you could say ""crazy people"".  However, out of a need for specificity, the OP didn't say ""people"".  ""People"" don't view the SPLC as a hate group.  Certain *kinds* of people do.

Whether you agree with the analogy itself or not, I still don't feel like he's calling people who dislike SRS neo-nazis.  If he had used another group like white supremacists or kkk members, you'd be just as upset with that ""comparison"", but these are the people who consider SPLC to be a hate group.  Do you think he's saying that SRS members would make good lawyers, and are awfully like the people in SPLC?  Because that's the opposite side of the coin here.  If he's drawing a direct comparison between hating SRS and neo-nazis, then he's ALSO drawing a direct comparison between members of SRS and lawyers in the SPLC.

If that claim *was* true, it would indicate that Zoe Quinn was suing immoral practices to get her product ahead in the world of gaming, while the journalists were letting their personal lives take top priority over what their articles are based on and the content that these articles contain. That sounds a little bit unethical to me.

I read through the article and I wouldn't go so far as to call it one sided, but it's pretty close. Take a look at the two pictures used in the first page of the article. The first one, Zoe Quinn, is her standing proud, resilient against adversity and reflective on what she has faced over the past few months. It's a pretty nice full profile picture, right? What about Ebon Gjoni's picture, is that one similar? No, not at all. The photographer is the same, but the style is noticeably different. Instead of showing off his body like in Quinn's picture, the photographer decided to focus on Gjoni's face, like a mugshot. His face is also neutral, cold, expressionless, which does match how the writer describes him in person, but it also gives him a rather off-putting presence on the page. And that, I think, reflects the purpose of this entire article. It doesn't serve to inform, it's purpose is to persuade, to change opinions. And I have no problem with that, that can be one of the many uses of an article. However, I would've preferred an article that didn't seem to favour one side over the other. Quotes such as: 

>“Hate mob—all right,” said the judge. “I’ll put that in quotations. Good luck, ma’am. So long.”

Make it sound like, to me, the article writer wasn't happy with the judge's verdict. I sincerely doubt that's how the judge closed the court session, by saying ""so long"" in such a blase manner. But then, this ""frustration of the legal system"" pops up again on the third page where Quinn and Gjoni were present in a courthouse, and Gjoni's violations of her court order were all dismissed bar one. Is the legal system part of Gamergate too? The article goes out of it's way to give a little mention of ""SWATting"" on it's 3rd page, but the description it gives seems a little off:

>A few even “swatted” their victims, tricking police dispatchers into sending SWAT teams to raid women’s homes.

The way the article is written makes it seem like Swatting happens primarily to female visionaries in the gaming industry, when in fact streamers are the usual targets of these attacks, both male and female. If you were reading this article and were generally unaware of the various parts of the gaming culture while reading this article, it wouldn't take you long to come across to the side of thinking that women often have SWAT teams called to their homes and receive death threats regularly thanks to male gamers. This is obviously not true, and these cares are, of course, extremely serious and unacceptable, but are also extremely *rare*.

There's also the whole other debate on the second page, which is sexism in video games as a whole. To be honest, I don't really feel as if it belonged in the article, and even though it did I feel it deserved a little more attention rather than just have it thrown in to the small paragraph it is. Whenever the subject is brought up in the article, especially on the 3rd page, it portrays men as woman hating psychopaths, hungry for blood when that simply is not the case. For example, /r/gaming has ~~9~~ 8 million subscribers and if we assume that half of them are men for arguments sake, does that mean that the sub is filled with ~~4.5~~ 4 million misogynists? No, of course not. I'm a man, and I play video games. I honestly do not care who I play against online, because it doesn't matter to me. And I really think this is how most people feel in regards to the topic. Sure, there's insults thrown around regularly while playing, but regardless of your gender this is going to happen. The gaming culture is a wonderful place, but like all things there are people involved in the culture that aren't representatives of the culture as a whole. Do you really think that the majority of gamers endorse those videos of people threatening Quinn, Sarkeesian and Chu? Of course they don't, because that'd be barbaric. 

As I said in a reply to another person in this thread, just because a marginal percentage of KiA are misogynistic does not mean that every single person who frequents the subreddit hate women. And that's what misogynistic means. I often visit KiA, and I certainly don't hate women. And with regards to what you said before:

>gamergate literally started as a harassment campaign against some female game developer. KiA therefore has guilt by association... 

Is a total logical fallacy. Just because people were spurred to action over a certain event does not instantly mean these people advocate that type of event. KiA doesn't even have any reference to ""Gamergate"" in it's title. The purpose of the sub is not to circulate Gjoni's ""Zoe Post"" and spread woman hating ideals. The sub is dedicated to identifying and archiving breaches of ethics in journalism that seemingly run rampant in websites such as Kotaku, Polygon and Rock Paper Shotgun. However, because these sites so often take a side in the GG debacle, GG content often shows up on the sub. 

And just a final note, didn't someone who actively supports the ""Anti-SJW"" side of GG, Sargon of Akkad, recently get their personal info leaked by SJW's, resulting in people messaging his wife? I wouldn't really rule out immoral, unethical practices on either side of the ""conflict"". But then, whose to say an SJW leaked the information? It may have been someone who takes no sides in this conflict who is merely interested in antagonising people on the internet, and that's entirely possible. However, doesn't that mean it's also equally possible that those people who harassed Quinn, Sarkeesian, Chu and others may not represent the ""Anti-SJW"" side of Gamergate as well?

People who make petty arguments in favor of serious topics for their own self-aggrandizement and in the process make others who are also interested in those things happening look unreasonable rather than just keeping quiet unless you're wanting to contribute to the discussion in a productive way.

Take when this was posted originally. If John Q public, uninitiated on this topic, were to click through this list and see that a lot of them had one or two subscribers. They would then reasonably concluded that this whole controversy was something blown out of proportion by people trying to grandstand versus something that should actually be dealt with. Thankfully the original comment was edited so that they only referenced subs with 100+ subscribers but the list was originally put together by someone who was clearly just interested in getting the list as long as they could get it.

I disagree. You're clearly very invested in this topic, so I suspect that you're view of what a reasonable interpretation would be is a bit skewed. 

There are many people who would argue that when you expose yourself to certain kinds of porn, you become desensitized to it and need more extreme versions of it to get off. That in turn leads to an increased desire to consume more extreme porn, which creates a larger market for that kind of porn. In the specific case of child porn, increasing the demand may therefore indirectly increase the production of it, and cause the victimization of more children.

To be clear, I'm *not* arguing that (nor am I arguing against it), I'm just pointing out that it is a position that could and is reasonably held by many people. Ultimately though, it does not matter what conclusion other people would come to, it only matters what conclusion the admins come to, since they are the judge and jury here. If reddit does not want to be in the business of making judgement calls on the edge cases of child pornography, I would not begrudge them for that. That's a totally reasonable position to take. The internet is a big place, you can get it elsewhere. 

> The argument im making is THERE IS NO MINOR. none of your argument matters if the minor you are talking about doesnt even exist.

If you've depicted a minor in your hentai, then you've sexualized a minor. A fictional minor, but a minor nonetheless.

>  by the logic that real world rules apply to fictional beings, shouldnt we ban every fictional character who has ever killed another character? would that not be murder in your eyes?

It would be fictional murder, but there's no rule against that, so it doesn't matter.

> how do you even define that a fictional character is a minor? you cant! the artist can say any number of things to make that character not a minor and you cant tell the age of a fictional character from a drawing alone. How do you know it isnt a 22 year old who just looks like that? or what if its just the art style? what if its an 18 year old with a disease? or one pretending to be younger than she is? None of these is answerable without talking to the artist and since this is a fake person we are talking about, it can change whenever.

All of these are interesting questions I'm sure, for some other porn site to carve out answers to. Reddit however has made it clear where they draw the line.

Anyways, in order as well:

First off, I'm going by actions not the side bar. What SRS is doing is mocking comments. They link to comments and posts exclusively and not to user profiles. The post titles are either quotes from the post or ""look at what's being said here"" not ""look at these *people*""

The defense isn't ""but they do it to"" it's that the maintaining of a generic tag list isn't inherently a problem. If someone posts in, just for example, Coontown and I see them making something that might be interpreted as racist then that information changes how I react to their comment. There's nothing wrong with this, it's public information and bots to create tag lists are publicly available.

Quoting this one:

> That kind of proof just doesn't really exist beyond statistical evidence to say X people on the list experienced X. The people using the list won't admit to using it so we can't ever ""prove"" that. It's only supporting the idea of a continued targeted harassment, instead of a single instance of harassment.

So first off, proof of harassment and vote brigading doesn't exist *for users*. The admins have access to back-end metrics and do use them to look for and deal with stuff like this. These metrics are the reason the admins have said, repeatedly, that SRS isn't the huge problem the anti-SRS crowd seem to think it is.

This doesn't support the idea of anything except confirmation bias. I've seen, repeatedly, someone post something shitty, it starts to get upvoted, gets linked by SRS, and then tanks. The assumption by the link-ee is that the SRS link was the cause, but if that were the case then you'd see that happen consistently. SRS ran a bot for a while that looked at posts directly after being linked and then tracked their vote totals and found no evidence that being linked by SRS significantly impacts a post. Again, this is supported by admin metrics.

>As far as NP links go, it's only additional supporting evidence ontop of the stated reason for SRS to exist. If they truly believed in not touching the comments (or poop as you call it), they would do what most of the other subreddits do and use .np links. They are the only ""large"" subreddit with this exception that I'm aware of, do you know of any others?

As I said, they previously had an ""NP only"" rule, and they stopped it because NP doesn't even work for a lot of subs, and the filtering was a pain. Also calling SRS ""large"" is... kind of funny really. They're pretty small by sub standards. For comparison SRD has 200k subs to SRS 71k, and while it does require NP links... there's an exception for ""me_irl"" and Advice Animals, I assume because they made their NP CSS unusable.

> I mean demeaning people for their comments they make on reddit. I mean breaking this exact content policy that is in place.

Except nothing SRS does comes under the definition of ""demeaning"".

> de·mean (dəˈmēn/) verb - cause a severe loss in the dignity of and respect for (someone or something).

The person in question said something, they're drawing attention to it. That's hardly demeaning. It may be drawing attention to something someone has said that demeans themselves, but that's not SRS's fault.

> If it's not users they are targeting why are they going back 4 + years on someones comments to post something about them?

The going back 3 years is the exception to content posted on SRS, not the rule, not by a long shot. The only reason that comment got brought up is because it's relevant to this current discussion of Reddit rules. In order for that to be harassing that user you would need more than one datapoint suggested that SRS as a group is targeting that particular user. For the sub to be banned over it there would need to be evidence of negligence on the part of the mods in dealing with it.

>  that's a clear example of a subreddit that needs to be banned, and the moderators banned as well for supporting that kind of toxic place.

The admins seem to disagree.

> They are literally calling it hilarious to mock, scorn and demean someone, if that's not a clear example of a horrible community I don't know what is. Let's hope you actually read and respond.

There's something pretty neck-beard-ey. Putting quotes around something I never said. You could certainly say I implied it but you can't quote me as saying it because I didn't.

And what I did say is more complex. So try and exercise those brain cells and consider it a little more seriously.

False. That is not nearly the only result. It is in fact not even a result. Unless you have some sort of proof I am unaware of. I've kept an eye on what they're up to over at Voat and it's pretty obvious to me that they certainly intend to strike back against reddit and may already be doing so.

Here's a compilation of posters SCREAMING about how SRS is ***worse*** than coontown. Who's not mobbing now?

> /r/ShitRedditSays is racist and sexist crap. They are explicitly and proudly anti-straight-white-male. Why haven't they been banned yet?

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsuu62)

> SRS and the likes are smart about it and talk about doxxing, ruining peoples lives and taking over reddit using their private chats, not on their subreddits.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctst6f8)

> but not /r/shitredditsays? Not /r/AgainstMensRights? Hateful, bigoted communities that actually do invade other subs? Apparently only certain types of bigotry and brigading aren't tolerated here.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsr3hw)

> Whether or not you appreciate SRS as some sort of satire, it is hateful. Maybe it's hateful as a joke, but it's still hateful.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsug0q)

> srs probably have more hate and spite in their hearts than ct tbh

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctssbqy)

> Not at all, but that's my point. The hate of SRS has caused additional hateful communities in response.

> SRS needs to go.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsrsrw)

> Because if he did that, SRS, SRD, feminism, etc would have to go because they're racist as hell against ""cisgendered white men""

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctstufw)

> Then shouldn't we be asking the question what Coon town did too harass other users? They were banned for being racist, which if you read srs you'll know that they are racist as well unless you roll with the definition of power + prejudice = racism.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsriub)

> srs is actually a small group of extremely active hate speech advocates. Just because they're relatively small doesn't mean they don't shitpost at 3x the rate of plenty of larger subs.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsrsds)

> Well technically some of Reddit wanted coontown. Maybe not the company but some users. Also, I've never seen coontown leaking into other subreddits but SRS by definition is a subreddit that fucks with other subreddits. Almost nobody likes it and they brigade and doxx users yet continue to exist because they aren't racists. 

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctss25q)

> Hate Speech is the foundation of SRS/SRD

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsubob)

> SRS is just as much a hate group like /r/coontown was. There is just as much hate-speech going on like in /r/coontown was.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsuacd)

> What about the fact that SRS to their very core are as Toxic a community as Coontown?

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsrc0o)

> SRS and its affiliates is by far one of the most racist and sexist networks on Reddit. So it would be a net positive to remove this kind of cancer.
[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctss65m)

> Maybe not as strongly on any individual post, but the overall vitriol and toxicity, yes.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsu3q6)

> I question your understanding of SRS when you connect them only with brigading. Have you looked at their subreddit title? 'Chill All Men'. As a male, I'm concerned by subreddits which suggest I should be killed. 

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctstuic)

> banned a disgusting hive of racism?

> BUT WHAT ABOUT SRS

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqxj9)

> SRS is worse than Coontown. Coontown was largely self contained. They didn't brigade other subs. They kept to themselves.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctss50u)

> Or SRS are simply hypocrites. They are just as hateful and bigoted as the groups they criticize, but towards different targets.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctstt2w)

> SRS has caused people to kill themselves... They doxx people and ruin their lives because they said mean things on the internet lol... Yeah totally an okay subreddit.

> You're right, SRS is worse as they actually do things to people IRL. Neo-nazis just march around and drive up the price of WWII-vintage k98s.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsrdnm)

> Do you honestly expect them to ever touch that sub? SRS is the correct kind of hate.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsufhk)

> Except it was proven that SRS is the most toxic sub on the whole site:

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsstso)

> SRS is a hate group as much as any of the other subs that are getting banned wantonly by the reddit admins. Just because they hide behind a facade of ""Social Justice"" doesn't mean they're actually good people. They're just typical SJWs trying to find new ways to be professional victims. They're the cancer that is slowly taking over reddit.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqyg6)

> I think it's pretty clear that SRS is a cancer on the community and needs to go. It ABSOLUTELY prevents many people from being able to enjoy Reddit. The brigade of downvotes they bring makes people afraid to say what they want. Every day you allow that sub to exist, you're showing how hypocritical you are. That you are making arbitrary decisions on what subs get banned based on nothing more than your personal preference.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctstr6s)

> /r/ShitRedditSays not only is considered extremely offensive by the average redditor, but it also makes us feel unsafe, and they constantly harass people, doxx, and brigade.

> They link to our posts, then they vote brigade them, insult us and follow us around the site. If that does not prevent people from having authentic conversation in this site then I don't know what does. 

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsre68)

> It's absurd. /r/shitredditsays has been THE primary harasser in reddit's history. Can anyone honestly name a sub currently in existence that has had a bigger history of harassment than SRS?

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctssqdq)

> If Reddit wants to ban discriminatory subreddits then it needs to ban ALL of them and not just a few that target specific minorities. So if they decide that the rules cover the banning of /r/coontown for discriminating against blacks they should also ban /r/ShitRedditSays for discriminating against men and /r/TheRedPill for discriminating against women. Either you ban all of them or you keep all of them, no middle ground here imho.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctstiha)

> They generally did a good job staying in their own subreddit and no bothering people. /r//shitredditsays however spends all it's time harassing and doxing people. Everyone knows this. Why won't you ban them? 

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctssxrq)

> so why does /r/shitredditsays exist? They are the most toxic brigading community here! Is that because they suit your agenda? Just go visit their sub its literally the toxic pool of hate.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsur75)

> If you're going to ban that hate-reddit, you have to ban ALL the hate-reddits, like /r/againstmensrights & /r/shitredditsays. Otherwise you're just picking and choosing when to enforce your rules.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctstg7v)

> Yet, I see the anti-white hate of /r/blackladies is still around, and the constantly harassing and brigading /r/shitredditsays is still around. Nice way to cherrypick your ""hate"", isn't it?

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsrluj)

> Honest question, why is /r/shitredditsays allowed to organize downvote brigades and with death upon men, spewing nothing but senseless hatred, and nobody cares?

We're users. In what world do we have some crazy right to demand all information from a company? Before you say *transparency!!!!* really think a few seconds about that.

Now I'm not an admin, but I'm certainly not as stupid as some of the users here thinking that ""just because *I* can't think of a reason for the admin behavior, doesn't mean there isn't one.""

Let's go with a small example:

You know how leetspeak came to be? It was because certain sites banned hatespeech. Users figured it out and started circumventing it with leetspeak. Publish a blacklist and users will figure out how to circumvent it, as I previously stated. You ask *how*, but the answer is pretty obvious if you think about it. /r/coontown becomes /r/c00nt0wn, or /r/koontown, or whatever. You get the idea. Except publishing the list gives users not only a stepping stone to create new ones, but a directory for all users looking for a new version of the old banned subreddit. *On top of* giving them a new game to play, when they're already bored trolls causing admin's a frustrating game of whack-a-mole.

So that's just one *con*. 

The *pro* here is just satisfying you political users who cry themselves to sleep about censorship that doesn't affect them one iota but sounds *super spooky*.

And seriously - if we lost all those users this site would be better off and the signal to noise ratio would be way sharper. Transparency is great, but these guys don't know when to stop because you can't get around the first tree.

>First off, I'm going by actions not the side bar. What SRS is doing is mocking comments. They link to comments and posts exclusively and not to user profiles. The post titles are either quotes from the post or ""look at what's being said here"" not ""look at these people""

So, how exactly do you know all of their actions exactly? We've actually discussed that they target people (by their tag list), they mock people (by their own admission), they purposefully look for the worst things they do (by their sidebar and what is submitted),  their entire community is built around demeaning people and their conversations. The content policy literally says and I quote

>systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas

The community is built in a way to provide a systematic approach to point out peoples behavior, they provide a list (pre-created) of people to target, they log their conversations in an attempt to shame them, they have gone back years and years on people to an attempt to shame them again. 

>The defense isn't ""but they do it to"" it's that the maintaining of a generic tag list isn't inherently a problem.

No, but when the community is BUILT to log the worst possible things they say, to SHAME them and then provide a tool to continue that harassment in a systematic way IS. If it was a tag list of indie game developers to encourage them, that would be a totally different list. This goes back to the content policy of a ""systematic and/or continued action"" the tag list is exactly proof of encouragement and continuation this (wanted) behavior. 

>So first off, proof of harassment and vote brigading doesn't exist for users. The admins have access to back-end metrics and do use them to look for and deal with stuff like this. These metrics are the reason the admins have said, repeatedly, that SRS isn't the huge problem the anti-SRS crowd seem to think it is.

So, several issues with this, they have continued to encounter problems  detecting brigading and harassment, and it continues to plague the site in lots of ways. They have no magical ""backend"" detection of brigading, they have tools, like IP address logging and relationships I hope they look at, but they can never know 100% but that's beside the point. Keep in mind the true violation that's going on here is the content policy, proof if brigading has always been hard for the common person to see. We have seen proof of harassment such as a 4+ year old comment from /u/warlizard , the rape threats such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/3fc9qg/update_im_the_girl_who_received_rape_threats/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qubn) and that's without even trying.

Once again, you are attracted to brigading, which is not my point. I'm talking about harassment and bullying. 

SRS is in the top 500ish subreddits if I remember correctly, I would classify that as a rather large subreddit. Sure it's not compared to /r/pics, but compared to 99% of the other subreddits it is. This still doesn't debate my points, the fact that they DID use .np links, but decided to stop only raises more questions. 

>Except nothing SRS does comes under the definition of ""demeaning"".....The person in question said something, they're drawing attention to it. That's hardly demeaning. It may be drawing attention to something someone has said that demeans themselves, but that's not SRS's fault.

That's not how that works at all, if you continue to mock and make fun of someone for something they said, that is causing a lack of respect for them and a loss of dignity. That is exactly what fph was doing that got them banned, they went much much larger then SRS did with the imgur staff, as opposed to SRS hasn't taken on such a local target for the reddit administration. That's the difference I see.

>The going back 3 years is the exception to content posted on SRS, not the rule, not by a long shot. The only reason that comment got brought up is because it's relevant to this current discussion of Reddit rules. In order for that to be harassing that user you would need more than one datapoint suggested that SRS as a group is targeting that particular user. For the sub to be banned over it there would need to be evidence of negligence on the part of the mods in dealing with it.

See the above links, see the moderators of SRS disregard for his concern, of HIS harassment. I would say that's condoning this situation. If it was just a user who submitted it, and it got banned, then sure that argument would have weight, but instead he was ridiculed and demeaned by the moderator for his hurt. How is that somewhere that he feels safe having a discussion? You can discredit this particular instance of shaming all you want, but the moderators of SRS condoned it. 

>The admins seem to disagree.

And that is the crux of the argument I am looking for why. I am looking for a clear response as to if they just think reddit sucks and people should be harassed for the things they say, they thing redditors should be demeaned for it, but yet they seem to say they shouldn't but don't ban SRS. If they truly disagree they need to make clear what their content policy truly is, because as any person would read this 

>Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation...

SRS does exactly this to the things people say, to express their ideas. It's a pity that a community built around hate has a place on reddit, but it's their website. I just want them to be upfront and honest.

Proptip: do try to be critical about minorities in srs. They'll ban you immediately. Coontown even invited sjws for debate. Who's intollerant now?

And in srs' case, they are just pushing the agenda that all white males should die. It's the same thing. Meant hopefully seriously only by a minority as in coontown. I already told you what the sub consisted of. Edgy stuff, jokes, researched facts and people sharing their stories, which would be called racist, because they were critical of minorities.

>Calling black people monkey's isn't funny.

Depends on your humor. I think it'can be funny., depending on context. Just as calling a white dude a cracker can be funny. Or joking about how Asians can't drive. Everything is funny. No one should be able to tell someone else what to find funny and simply ban humor that they don't agree with.

I really disagree. Emma Watson, one of the more influential people has given a speech on feminism. Taylor swift is a feminist. You can write them off as famous airheads, but they still have more fans and influence than someone like big red ever will. 


>using it to discredit men's rights movement at best also discredits feminism.

Feminism, with it's age, has spread out into so many different categories individual figureheads can't really be assigned to it; we've already divided it into three waves. We can't compare the two because they're at different stages of development. Criticize radical feminism or third wave if you like, it's still not all feminism, because feminism is too broad of a label.

The MRM, on the other hand, is relatively new, and unless they weed out the idiots and genuine misogynists quickly, every offshoot will be built on the same foundations, and they won't be able to shuck that reputation of being terrible. In it's gestation period the MRM is being given an opportunity to state it's case, and the crazies are speaking up loud and clear. Early feminist movements moderated themselves, where they tried to keep the extremists docile and away from the mic, and condemned any violence. Same with the civil rights movement.

Why say ""we ban subreddits that exist to harass other redditors"" and not ban a subreddit that has members that [actively do shit like this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/3f0vdo/im_a_girl_who_commented_that_false_rape/). This is just an example linked in this thread itself, you can find many more. Also someone talked about a sub dedicated to having sex with dogs still being up. Why did a sub dedicated to fantasies of having sex with children get banned (I'm happy about that) but not one about having sex with dogs? The thing being sexualized in both those cases cannot give consent, to me the issue with the content located on those subreddits is pretty similar. But apparently admins consider having sex with dogs ok under ""content policy"".

> If they decide tomorrow that they want to ban all unfunny memes, they can simply adjust the policy to say ""we ban all unfunny memes"".

That's the thing actually, the policy currently is not evenly and consistently applied.  I'm not advocating for bringing racist subreddits or ones that sexualize minors back at all, good riddance. I just don't get why the admins go on all these explanations posts and these are the reasons blablabla if they are not even consistent with what they say and what they do.

And I agree with you! Good, we're on the same page. You seem to keep skipping the second part of what I said though: reddit's policy is not contingent on whether the child depicted exists or not. There is requirement that a victim exist for the rule to apply. In fact the rules explicitly call out animated child porn as being disallowed. 

> since when did murder not count as encouraging or inciting violence? 

Since always. Who says otherwise?

Again, you're putting a lot of words in my mouth and arguing against statements I did not make.

> I am disagreeing with that line, which reddit has drawn, which is the entire point of all my comments.

Disagreeing with their policy and claiming they're not following their own policy are two different stances to take. You explicitly took the latter stance. If you are retracting your claim and saying that you disagree with their stance, then this discussion is over and we are in agreement. Their policy explicitly calls out animated content. Disagree with that all you like, but don't lie and say it's not against their policy.

>  As for them not following their own policy, thats become painfully obvious. [examples of other perceived issues]

These are deflections. If I see Alice kick Bob, and Carol claims Alice didn't kick Bob, I'm going to call out Carol for lying. If Carol says ""But Alice also kicked Dan and Eve!"" that's completely beside the point. She's changing the subject. She lied, I called her out on it. All that other information is superfluous. 

That said,

Just remember how many copies FPH immediately created, which all had to be banned. I expect them to ban more subs in the future, but currently, Coontown was one of the most infamous ones, so I understand why they started with it.

Coming back to SRS, I personally don't see any reason to doubt the accusation you linked to. I mean, I know that at the same time, SRSsucks often links to every stupid shit, so I can't speak about the issue of how legitimate the entirety of accusations against SRS are. For this particular accusation though, as said, I have no reason to doubt its validity. I hope that the users in question have been reported to the Mods and the Admins.  

At the end of the day, for me, it boils down to evaluating the culture of the sub. I think I'd be hard-pressed to find someone on SRS advocating or justifying sending rape threats. That doesn't mean they don't happen or that they are any less terrible when they do.  
It's just that when I compare SRS to other subs, those other subs will be much more apologetic and more based on harassment from the very beginning. For example, /r/KotakuInAction insists on it's right to invade every thread and every sub with it's content, no matter their rules; and will regularly deny accusations of wrongdoing and accuse the victims of lying for personal gain; will attempt to argue ""what harassment even is"" and so on and so forth. So of course I would be more likely to consider such a sub to be supportive of harassment, thereby implicitly encouraging it; compared to - as said, nonetheless inexcusable - isolated incidences by SRS users.

One being containment, which was the stated plan works best in these situations as many people on subs like that are trolls, or are active there out of spite.  One of the main rules of the internet is ""don't feed the trolls""... Keep them in a dark corner, give the mods tools to deal with any that come out of that corner and eventually the trolls leave due to no attention and the place fades away.  

The second reason is the lack of honesty in the admins motivations.  They can allow whatever they want on their site.  But to say one thing one week and do the opposite the next is not cool.

You are [more likely to receive a scholarship](http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/09/study_shows_that_white_students_are_more_likely_to_get_scholarship_money.html) if you go to college.

The reason you deny this is because you were born in a privileged enough position to not have to understand what living like a persecuted minority is like. Blissful ignorance.

>But surely blacks have privileges too

Your list is all nonsense, outright wrong, anecdotal, has no actual sources, and essentially rephrases affirmative action for half of it. The funny thing about affirmative action though is not only that it's illegal in most places now, but also that it's commonly used as a shield and deflection tactic in regards to the fact that actual racism is still very real and exists.

It's always brought up by racists and bigots..

* ..nevermind the fact that the white middle class was built of trillions of dollars of free federal aid in the form of the Homestead Act (not even 500 years of affirmative action could compare to this).

* Nevermind the fact that scholarships go disproportionately to white students. (source above)

* Nevermind the fact if you were black, daddy wouldn't have a college pension for you because blacks had no realistic economic or social prospects for success in this country before year 1964 (food for thought: My family has been here for 9 generations, and I'm the first one in my family born with all of my rights. **In nine generations** of American history I'm the first one. Do you have *any* idea of affect that has on generational wealth accumulation?).

* Nevermind the fact that white sounding names are 50% more likely to get call backs. (source above)

* Nevermind the fact that black college graduates, when finding/switching jobs, have 7-9 weeks more of downtime on average. 

* Nevermind the fact that white men with recent criminal histories are far more likely to receive calls back than black men with no criminal record at all. (http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/education/african-americans-with-college-degrees-are-twice-as-likely-to-be-unemployed-as-other-graduates-20140527)

* Nevermind the fact that getting the tiny minuscule benefit that you might get from affirmation action requires you to be black for 18 years, and for your family to lose 50,000 USD of wealth on average. (source above)

These things are all objectively verifiable fact. Affirmative action was not a privilege and was not free. It was a tiny band-aid attached to the wound of a man missing a limb.  It wasn't just a free thing that was given to someone. You're ignoring the huge opportunity cost that was paid by every black family in America to justify it being legislated in the first place. This cost was huge, so it was not ""free"" at all. 

So yes, he got a band-aid that you didn't get, but that because his arms were cut off. Want to make that trade?

Yes, which I acknowledged, but then I spent a lot of time showing how it's a totally disingenuous way of looking at the numbers.

Or maybe that white marbles are weaker than black ones? I don't know, there could be lots of different reasons and interpretations for that, and all of them would be way more likely than the black marbles just being more violent, just because.

Regardless, that entire conversation I had with that person had more to do with victimization rates than offender rates. (""5x actual number of violences are **on** white **than on** black is a fact"") If you want to look at offender rates, black people are much more likely to be offenders, but they're also much more likely to suffer from the [negative socioeconomic effects](http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-violence.aspx) that would cause that, and getting into why that's the case would mean digging through all the US's dirty laundry that they inherited.

I don't want to argue linguistics but an idiom is a form of slang.

Slang consists of a lexicon of non-standard words and phrases in a given language. Use of these words and phrases is typically associated with the subversion of a standard variety (such as Standard English) and is likely to be interpreted by listeners as implying particular attitudes on the part of the speaker. In some contexts a speaker's selection of slang words or phrases may convey prestige, indicating group membership or distinguishing group members from those who are not a part of the group.

They actually are.  These communities are radicalizing young, disenfranchised white men, and by supporting their existence you are supporting their radicalization.  Dylan Roof was filled with enough rage and hate to shoot 9 people because of online communities similar to /r/coontown.  Coontown was not a benign sub for alternative opinions.

Well, that would be a possible *reason* for why the blacks are more prone to breaking the whites than vice versa.  But I didn't ask you for a reason.  I asked about the math, the interpretation of the statistics alone (not possible reasons for why the numbers are what they are, but just the simple meaning of the numbers).

11894,5ryh8,ctyfz7r,t1_ctxx48i,t3_3fx2au,1439243303.0,1,"This is incorrect. First of all the Flynn Effect (IQ is a measure of potential academic performance that correlates with g, but not creativity or anything that actually makes intelligence worthwhile) demonstrates that IQ tests do not objectively measure ""intelligence"". IQ scores are way way up and people have not evolved in the last 50 years. Evolution takes millions of years. Second of all even using that metric you're still wrong:

>Bond early last century pointed out that the average IQ scores of African Americans from several northern states were higher than those for whites from many southern states (Bond, p. 63). He argued that African Americans who migrated to the North must have left their ""duller and less accomplished White fellows in the South."" Bond also believed that IQ test scores reflected social and educational training. Inline with this belief, Jenkins's reported the results of IQ tests given to Black and White children in Illinois, and found that the proportion of students with scores over 130 was the same among Black and White children when environmental influences were comparable. A later study, involving Caribbean children, would in essence replicate these findings. The results from that study showed that when raised in the same enriched institutional environments as white children, black children demonstrated superior IQ test scores. IQs were: Black children 108, Mixed children 106, and White children 103 (Tizard et al, 1972).
 
>Studies also show that upward of 99% of group IQ score differences between healthy black and white Americans are eliminated after controlling for cultural factors. Manly et al (1998) found that after cultural factors such as linguistic behavior are controlled between healthy black and white Americans that IQ score differences between these populations virtually disappear; becoming insignificant in all but only one area. Some argue that because those who construct standardized tests come from a narrow social group that it follows that test items will contain information and structures that match the background knowledge of some people more than others (Richardson, 2000). This may explain why “acculturation” is found to predict IQ score differences better than virtually any other variable, aside from literacy levels (which is essentially another mediator of culture). Other studies have shown similar results, after controlling for cultural factors. Fagan and Holland (2002) found that where exposure to specific information was required; whites knew more about the meanings of different sayings than did Blacks, due to exposure. But, when comprehension was based on generally available information, Whites and Blacks did not differ (Fagan and Holland, 2002; see also, Fagan and Holland, 2007). This study also found that when Blacks and Whites are matched as to the comprehension of sayings requiring specific knowledge that Blacks were superior to Whites on intelligence tests (ibid).

>scholastic achievement gaps are a burden of the race, not the system.

Also incorrect.

>Minority children tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. Quality of public education in residential areas across the United States is linked to neighborhood socioeconomic status. Because middle-class African Americans tend to reside in segregated neighborhoods of lower socioeconomic character, they often attend struggling public schools which cannot provide the same academic resources as quality suburban schools.

>Historically, programs designed for black school systems to succeed were all dropped by the early 1980s. Monetary funds were instead put into suburban schools, bolstering white flight, and causing black schools to deteriorate in quality. The disparity in expenditures on education between inner cities and affluent suburbs exist almost entirely due to the system of property taxes which most school systems rely on for funding.[31] By attending spatially segregated school systems, children of the black middle class are locked out of the same educational and employment opportunities as their white counterparts. In general, minority students are more likely to reside in lower or middle class inner city neighborhoods, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources.[32] Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.[33]",False,False,False,15385,18040,1314958152.0,False,True

They're not supposed be equal. I said that they actually go disproportionately to white people. Meaning above their population share.

>Also, every crime stat is a result of activity, not bigotry.

You're short-sighted if you actually believe this. Observe:

>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/03/04/the-12-key-highlights-from-the-dojs-scathing-ferguson-report/

>For example, in the summer of 2012, a 32-year-old African-American man sat in his car cooling off after playing basketball in a Ferguson public park. An officer pulled up behind the man’s car, blocking him in, and demanded the man’s Social Security number and identification. **Without any cause, the officer accused the man of being a pedophile, referring to the presence of children in the park, and ordered the man out of his car for a pat-down, although the officer had no reason to believe the man was armed**. The officer also asked to search the man’s car. The man objected, citing his constitutional rights. In response, the officer arrested the man, reportedly at gunpoint, charging him with eight violations of Ferguson’s municipal code…**because of these charges, he lost his job as a contractor with the federal government that he had held for years**. (2)

>The Justice Department also revealed that driving the **uneven hand of the law in Ferguson was ""the city's emphasis on revenue generation**.""

>**City officials repeatedly pushed the Ferguson police department to increase city revenue through ticketing, resulting in disproportionate targeting of African-Americans**.

>**African-Americans were disproportionately targeted by those practices, ticketed and cited for minor violations at a higher rate than white residents**.

>**And African-Americans were almost exclusively on the receiving end of some violations :they accounted for 95% of ""manner of walking in roadway"" charges and 94% of ""failure to comply"" charges, for example.**

Not every arrest or crime that goes in the stats is actually legitimate.

It's like certain stores not allowing you to take pictures or video inside. They aren't restricting your rights to do these things entirely - they're just telling you that they own the store and those things aren't okay to do when you're visiting.

Two questions here: What is the absolute number of incidents? What does that number mean in proportion to their respective populations?

Oh, I can't use examples? Christ this whole discussion is so stupid.

>Did you miss the part where the KiA mods banned submissions targeting Ghazi? 

Soooo why is that post on the front page there?

>And requiring np links are at least a sign that the mods oppose brigading, whereas SRS rarely uses them.

They don't do anything, they are barely useful and as the admins have stated, they don't care.

>It was an email campaign and the admins have since clarified that these are allowed, so, what about it?

If SRS was doing something similar, you'd be up in arms, that's what about it. You have a massive double standard and you can't even see it.

>What does making alts have to do with SRS? Alts aren't against reddit rules.

They are against the rules if they are made to avoid bans and harass people, which is kinda my whole point here. SRS is creating alt accounts to avoid bans and continue harassing people, so they haven't done anything that is ban worthy...

I'm not arguing they are ""good"" people! You don't need to prove that they are douchebags, misguided, and trigger happy, because they are and no one is arguing that.

>Also, do you have proof that those accounts are coontown alts?

As I stated, these were ones we ""suspected"" of being coontown alts due to the comments they made being nearly identical to already banned accounts of coontown users. As I don't have access to the info the admins do, and they aren't going to spill the beans, no I don't have proof, which I've been more than open about and never requested concrete proof from you. Notice how I didn't completely dismiss the false rape story since there isn't conclusive proof? I have my doubts about it, but as I said, it certainly doesn't look good. But I'm not dismissing it just because there isn't proof, as proof isn't possible in this situation.

>Actually, more SRSers have jumped into that thread since I linked it.

Have you bothered reporting them?

>o brigade here, right! And that was just the first example I grabbed off SRS front page, you can find this kind of thing or worse at any given time on that sub.

You probably can, but as the same goes for SubredditDrama, it's not necessarily considered brigading. One of my biggest annoyances with the admins is they haven't clarified what exactly brigading is.. Just because you found a link through a meta sub and comment in it, doesn't mean it's a brigade. Voting seems to be more likely to be considered brigading, but even then, it's murky at best.

Also, seeing as coontown wasn't banned for ""brigading"", what exactly is your point here? Are you suggesting these users are creating alt accounts to avoid bans after they have commented in linked threads? Because that's what coontown was doing.

>It's not a ""brigade"" if the one sub isn't directly linking to the other. There's no link to the Ghazi thread in that post.

Sure there is, you just remove the archive.org bit and you are in the thread! Also, that's not ""brigading"" either and wasn't my point. I dont' think KiA should be banned, I am just highlighting that by your logic, it should be banned.

Probably? Like I said, there really isn't a ""clear"" policy on what is and isn't brigading. My guess is that this *isn't* brigading unless they were voting or harassing individual users.

>No, if they were harassing a private individual as in the case of Destiny I would object.

Soo what of KiA's harassment of Zoe Quinn et all?

>And no, I didn't report them. I've reported some SRS threads in the past, but since the admins seem determined not to do anything about them

So you aren't going to do anything about it, but you are going to continue bitching about it and acting like they control reddit somehow.

You know how many legitimate spammers i've reported and nothing has been done? Quite a few. Do I think the admins allow spam for dildos? No, they probably are just flooded and missed it. They use modmail too and trust me when I say, it sucks majorly.

>SubredditDrama is basically an SRS sister-sub at this point.

Ahhahahaha. Why is that? Sure the comment sections get a little more circlejerky and off topic than I would like, but the mods know that and just haven't figured out how to fix it.

>It was supposedly banned for interfering with other subs, which brigading falls under.

Ish? But since there aren't clear cut rules on brigading, it's kinda pointless to argue ""see they are brigading and aren't banned"" when the people who were banned weren't banned for brigading...

>You know the rule to disallow links to other subs does a lot to reduce cross-sub fighting.

Sure it does, but it's not required and as I showed, doesn't stop it. I'm trying to demonstrate how KiA is guilty of pretty much the same stuff you are accusing SRS of doing and claiming they should be banned for.
