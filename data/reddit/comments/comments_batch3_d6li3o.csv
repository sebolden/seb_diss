In 2018, Reddit received 28 requests for the production of user account information from foreign governmental authorities (excluding emergency requests). Reddit did not comply with any of these requests.

I noticed that the specific foreign governments are unlisted in either the posted summation above or the actual Report.

Is there a legal reason why the governments were unlisted?

I don't honestly understand how Reddit's platform can prioritize free speech, while allowing community moderators to extremely censor communities, but having administrators not act on people who are outright racist/promote nazism (not Godwin's law, I'm talking about people promoting the genocide or killing of people who don't fit with their ideology), or those who are endangering others indirectly or directly (antivaxxers, calling for assassinations of people, hate speech*, etc.).

*Hate speech as in speech that is stereotyping or harassing a person or people due to their race/gender/orientation/religion, not calling a person an asshole due to that person's actions

Spez, you seriously need to enforce the general rules for subreddits so there isn't such a massive power hold by people who basically just control subreddits on a first come, first serve basis, and does massive censorship for differentiating viewpoints. Hell, we have multiple sites that show when posts are getting censored.

If Reddit truly was a place of free speech, then those types of sites shouldn't exist in the first place. You need to hold the administrators and moderators of reddit accountable.

Some fairly easy ideas that could be done for this is:

* Requiring removed content to have a reason based on the rules of that subreddit or the site's overall rules

* Requiring more than just one moderator to make the decision of removing content. Could be modified for low-moderated subreddits, but it should be at least a requirement for those over an x amount of daily viewers/subscribers.

* Giving members the awareness regarding which moderator removed a post / making a punishment, and allowing them to challenge that removal or ban.

Speaking as one of the mods of r/brasil, I feel like Reddit doesn't care a lot for communities that are linked by language, not topics like most subreddits. I have two questions regarding different cultures and languages on Reddit.

1) **The redesign seems much easier to use for new users**, and we had some success in promoting AMAs in our community recently, including a journalist and a member of the Brazilian Pirate Party ([full list here](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/wiki/amas_oficais)), but we still occasionally get stuck **explaining how the interface works because of the language barrier**. One possible problem is that the interface is written in English. **Are there plans to translate new.reddit to other languages**? 

2) **Harassment and hate speech is still a problem** on Reddit, but most of it is contained in a few subreddits. However, harassment and hate speech happen **across different languages and cultures**. How do you believe Reddit can still grow, but avoid problems like Facebook's awful handling of the [Rohingya persecution in Myanmar](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html) or the [spread of fake news in Brazil](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-whatsapp-explainer/facebooks-whatsapp-flooded-with-fake-news-in-brazil-election-idUSKCN1MU0UP)?

> 2) Foreign Government Removal Requests (Non-Copyright)

> In 2018, Reddit received a total of 101 requests to remove or restrict access to content from 5 foreign governmental entities. Governments sent requests for various reasons, including that content was deemed illegal in their jurisdiction. ... Where appropriate, rather than removing a post outright, Reddit may block the post from being accessible in a particular country.

Hopefully the information isn't already in the graph (it wouldn't load for me) but can you provide some examples of these types of removals/restrictions? I think this would go a good way towards quelling fears of Chinese censorship, however unfounded they might be based on your other comments.

> 3) Foreign Non-Governmental Removal Requests (Non-Copyright)

> When Reddit receives removal requests for content that violates local law but is not against Reddit's Content Policy, Reddit may restrict the availability of that content in the country where it is alleged to be illegal.

Can you provide any examples of the types of laws where this might apply?

> Reddit also considers whether the use of a copyrighted work identified in a notice may fall under an exception listed in the DMCA, such as fair use, and may ask the copyright owner who submitted the notice to consider the same.

What does that mean? Well, a privacy canary is basically a phrase in there that says ""we have never given info to X"", the ""X"" in question with this being US intelligence services. See, when those come knocking, you basically cannot refuse, and once you comply, you can't put ""hey guys btw. we are giving all your data to the NSA"" in an announcement (though it's actually less ""give us all your info"" and more ""let us install direct siphons so we can access everything without even asking you""). So they strike the  aforementioned  canary from the TOS, it's the only way to let the users know. 

Basically, what I'm saying is that anyone who is cautious about his privacy on the internet should be aware that pretty much all US intelligence agencies can have whatever information they want from Reddit, and Reddit can't tell you that that's what's happening and they can't count it in their statistics.

Why are you biased toward left wing politics, and why are you against free speech? Also, why are you algorithmically cenzor subs?

Examples:

1. the r/theredpill sub is under quarantine for no reason, nobody there is toxic, they try to help their fellow man out.
2. for months the r/MGTOW sub wasn't showing up in the search bar in the first 3rd results even when you searched for ""MGTOW"" (100% match).

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure there are many many other cases like these that i'm not aware of. So my question is:

# Reddit used to be a beacon of light for free speech, why is it going the the SJW shitter? Facts matter, and the truth will ALWAYS come to light, regardless of feelings.

As a note from somebody who've seen the rise and fall of movie makers, companies etc. If you try to cater to the 1%, you'll alienate your core audience for those that don't give a shit about you/your company/your site, and eventually you'll go down the shitter too.

There is absolutely massive discontent with the changes made to your self-serve advertising system.  A recent poll showed 90% discontent (https://i.redd.it/k00g6hknxyf21.png).

My question:  Why isn't something being done about this?  Also, why is <edit> still involved with Reddit?  He has threatened users with banning when provided with critical feedback, he has a consistent history of being threatening, inappropriate, and unprofessional on Reddit, and the advertising changes are really poor by design.  See here:  https://i.<edit>.com/COTvxni.png  +  https://i.<edit>.com/YUOOUOk.png + https://<edit>.com/a/ZHibaKU

Reddit's Advertising recently told a customer:  **""the extremely performance sensitive advertiser is not a customer we're able to support""**     This is an extremely offputting message.  

Just take a look at r/redditads and you will see a near-revolt going on.  

I've personally spent well in excess of $100,000 on advertising on Reddit on this account alone.  More if you include other advertising accounts.  I have supported Reddit massively over the years, only to have Reddit's service turn into an extremely insulting and unworkable system. 

Something needs to be changed with your self-serve system. The 1000% price increase needs to go.  New leadership needs to be brought in.  Better user support.  Better communication.

You want people to post their views openly down voting prevents them from presenting their views thus its not a open discussion like having a face to face conversation. 


**Question:** 

* Why can't we comment on ads? 
 * Or at least a ad subreddit where we review ads we missed because we clicked to the next page to fast. 
* Why can't we get that are targeted to what we can afford or need? 
 * Opt of food ads because your a diabetic.

Today we’ve posted our latest Transparency Report.

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the purpose, tone, and norms of their community. You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

–Catherine

If fictional depictions of violence against people are okay(like in videogames) then why not indecient?  Or how lolicon is a legal grey area but you have a sub dedicated to an illegal drug(r/trees).  Or how some subs allow depictions of real children to be harmed. Or other drawn porn subs with underage characters.  Or NSWF subs with legal age models pretending to look underage.  Or legal age cosplayers dressing up as the very characters that are banned if drawn.  So I feel this is less about legality and more about being less weird.  Then not to mention all of the trouble last week with anime girls.  I honestly joined this site for that type of anime related content.  While definitly weird, I feel it's harmless.  

Next, I feel that your rules have damaged the anime community here.  Many users feel worried about being banned for posting anime related things due to how anime in general has underage characters.  This is not a good way to run a discussion site.  How am I suppose to talk about my favorite anime if I'm going to get banned because it has a beach episode or there's panty shots, or two girls kiss or something?  Some popular shows there's no way to walk around the sexual part such as Strike Witches, Kill La Kill,  Prisma Illya, ect. I honestly feel like dropping this site.  I no longer feel welcomed.  Lolicons don't cause trouble, we don't brigade subs, we don't call out to harm others,  we just want our drawings.

If at the very least you could put the lolicon subs under quarantine and re think your stance on anime.

>In the field of Constitutional Law, there are many pages spent trying to come up with a reason for free speech. It’s about the “marketplace of ideas” some say: by putting all claims and points of view out in the open, the public can sort through and figure out the truth, leaving the untruths to fall by the wayside. Others argue that free speech is necessary for democracy, since voters must hear different opinions to decide how to use their votes, and that since even non-political speech can change people’s views, all speech must then be protected.

>There are many more justifications like this — a limit on government abuse, a policy to promote a more tolerant citizenship, etc. — but, like most justifications, they all say we should permit free speech because it allows us to do something else. And the frustrating thing about that is that it suggests that free speech should not be permitted when it doesn’t achieve those goals.

>Theorists of free speech are, in general, fans of the idea (or at least their market consists of fans) so they try to dance around this. “Oh no,” the marketplace-of-ideas partisans say, “we weren’t suggesting that obviously false statements could be prohibited because, after all, you really never know when false statements could turn out to be true!”

>But, as something of a free speech absolutist, it troubles me that such a thing is even theoretically possible. And I worry that if others adopt this theory, they may not be so stringent about the practical requirements. The temptation to clamp down on free speech is always strong; it’s probably not a sound idea to build the principle on such a shaky foundation.

>So I have my own justification for freedom of speech: because we can. Human freedom is important, so we should try to protect it from encroachment wherever possible. With most freedoms — freedom of motion, freedom of exchange, freedom of action — permitting them in full would cause some problems. People shouldn’t be free to walk into other people’s bedrooms, take all their stuff, and then punch the poor victims in the face. But hurling a bunch of epithets at the guy really isn’t so bad.

>Freedom of speech is one place where we can draw the line and say: all of this is acceptable. There’s no further logic to it than that; freedom of speech is not an instrumental value. Like all freedom, it’s fundamental, and the only reason we happen to single it out is because it’s more reasonable than all of the others.

>Close readers will note that this theory doesn’t quite live up to my own goals. By laying freedom of speech’s provision on top of our reasonable ability to do so, I suggest that freedom of speech could be taken away if providing it became unreasonable. But I think this is the right choice: if people really, seriously started getting hurt because of freedom of speech, it seems right for people to take the privilege away. But, to be honest, I can’t even imagine how that might be possible. Words just don’t genuinely wound, they’re always mediated by our listening.

>I do worry that people might try to stretch this justification — say that continued free speech might destroy the war effort, or the government, or civil society. But I have no problem destroying all of those. It’s only the destruction of actual people that I worry about.

>So here’s to free speech: because we can.

..Honestly what are you even trying to improve at this point? You're changing things people don't want changed. Those aren't improvements. Every improvement feels like a step back. People just want a place where they can say/post what they want.. and Reddit is going in the opposite trajectory. You just want more money. You're just gaining more power under the guise of ""helping to improve our platform"". I understand building more infrastructure to be able to support the amount of people on the site.. but other than that people don't want anything else. This is Reddit. You don't have to ""improve"" you just have to maintain. You know this.. you've seen the public backlash over redesigns/ whatever else has changed over the years, but you insist its improvements. 

The New York times has been around a long time.. its just news on a newspaper. We don't need fancy bells and whistles. We just want Reddit to feel free. All I see is more censorship.. more political bias.. more bullshit Mod intervention in things where they need not intervene under the guise of 'keeping things civil'. Civil? People cant even talk shit anymore or even debate half the time because of some sensitive mod trying to subjectively keep things 'civil'. 

This site is going backwards. Less user friendly. More corporation/ government friendly. So disappointing.. This place used to have a 'anything goes' type of feel. That was the magic of it. Thats the Reddit I fell in love with. That place is gone. 

Big government doesn't work. It doesn't work on the macro level and it doesn't work on the micro level. It always ends up in tyranny. You're trying to govern/control too much and you're choking the site. The more corporations you cater to, the more people you have to try not to offend.. the more you censor.. the more you conform.. the more the site dies. At that point its not even the peoples website.. its a corporate playground. You have to let the people govern. You have to let the people do what they will with limited intervention.

I had sent an email (?) / Message, regarding your Ad traffic policy a few months ago.

&#x200B;

In short, in around June 2018 I had sponsored ads for a subreddit targeting certain audiences and subreddits. The secondary fallout of that ad campaign was the reveal of regional traffic to subreddits, which was a meta discussion of its own. In June to August, 2018, certain country and big subreddits, for example /r/India and /r/PewdiepieSubmissions had 250k and over 500k impressions (as per traffic data for ad campaigns).

&#x200B;

Perhaps due to the meta discussion or other reasons, related or unrelated - the ad traffic information seems to have been meddled with.

&#x200B;

When I looked at them around Dec-Jan, as I was planning for a bigger campaign, it turns out both these subs (and others) now showed ""TOO LOW"" traffic to target. So, now these (and others) subreddits with over 150k subscribers and an average 1000-2000 online users has ""TOO LOW"" traffic now?

&#x200B;

Is this not preposterous? Even other country wise breakdown or other parameters seems to have been modified.

&#x200B;

**\*\*My questions\*\***

1. Why wasn't my e-mail responded to? (its been 2 months I guess)
2. Could you shed some light as to what happened? It is fine, please be curt.
3. What subreddits or keywords that are not targetable and by whom? (Like is it just for a few of us, like a blacklist?)

&#x200B;

I just want to know if it is worth investing on reddit ads when the admin/advertisement team are not transparent with the traffic.

&#x200B;

Life's too short to waste on this kind of negative emotion. If you aren't happy, make constructive criticism, enjoy the places that still conform to what you think Reddit should be, or leave, but it's just not healthy to sit around with hate burning you up.

This guy you hate was kind enough to come down and have lunch with me when I visited the HQ. He didn't have to -- I'm no one, just another Redditor. You have any idea how rare that is? He spoke passionately about always working to improve Reddit in a changing world, clearly cares deeply about what he created, and is bright as hell.

Whether you hate his policies or wish things were back the way they were in the ""Wild West"" days of Reddit, clinging to things that are gone is pointless, and frankly, being kind is just a better way to live.

BTW, I have my own complaints about the way Reddit has evolved, but in the almost-decade I've been on this site, I've found ways to enjoy it, despite my concerns, and one of the ways was simply by doing my best to be kind and reasonable.

>Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

>At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

>**During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population felt left out, left behind, and unheard by the system.**

>We are on the eve of the President’s SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we’re more divided than ever.

It’s much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs.

In my opinion, examples of ok behavior:

* Posting in a sub you moderate
* Removing comments that are basically ""/IranianGenius is a reposter"" or ""fuck /IranianGenius"" without any substance
* Removing other posts which are rule breaking

Examples of not ok behavior:

* Removing a post to get yourself higher on the sub (never seen him do that, but I've seen tons of subreddits do it to make their sub appear on /all more often)
* Locking a post because of too much hate (at this point disable inbox replies or delete the post)
* Berate users in a sub you moderate.

Even though posts get thousands of upvotes daily over there, they are not allowed to reach the front page, because Spez and the powers that be want people to believe that Donald Trump is not popular, when the opposite is true, just look at his rallies and poll numbers (not to mention not everyone on Reddit is american).

Your points are pretty logical but the truth is people fear what condoning lolicon might entail, because it's weird, people aren't aware of what someone who enjoys it is like and there is almost a certainty that because of its nature that pedophiles and scum alike are probably more represented in that medium than others. As opposed to things with mass appeal where the majority can say for a fact is harmless. So yes, it will be banned on that basis. Also, keep in mind, while it's legal in the U.S, it's illegal in Canada and a lot of Europe but your r/trees argument is a decent one. 

Maybe it's wrong to ban that sub but knowing human nature, it's completely understandable and many do not want to defend it on principle alone. Just as how many in Japan do not want to defend uncensored porn and so it remains censored.

To be clear, I do believe he gets a lot of hate that’s not necessarily warranted whenever he posts anything, and there are definitely a good share of straight up “fuck GallowBoob” comments, which deserve removal. (Personally, I think it’s a pretty enormous mistake to ever do that removal *yourself*, but that’s breaking no rules).

While his constant reposting of other posts into many subs is annoying to a lot of users, that’s not a crime. Cross posting is encouraged and common. If you don’t want to see that, block him. It’s easy enough, I’ve blocked several accounts like his, simply because I like more variety. I dislike how he does it, but not against the rules. 

Frankly, the greatest issue in my opinion is that he is simply unfit for moderation. I do think he’s broken rules in comment removal and banning people for having negative opinions of him, but I’d need to find sources for that and it’s honestly less important to me. 

To be a moderator of over 150 subreddits is simply ridiculous. No one person could devote enough time to warrant being on that many, and even if he gives time to some of them, others are clearly not going to get the same (and I’m aware smaller subs require far less moderation, but *150!?*). At this point, they’re just adding to the power and potential abuse that he could wield. 

He is consistently rude and disrespectful to commenters within and without subs he moderates. I’m fine with you doing whatever while you aren’t posting *as a moderator*, but he has made so many stickied comments and other comments with the moderator badge on that are simply inflammatory and attacking other users, sometimes on a personal level. 

And then there’s the aggressive reposting of the same post several times in an *incredibly* short time span, until one gains enough traction and he uses his moderation powers to remove the rest cleanly and quietly. There are several archives showing this behavior, across many subs that explicitly disallow it. I believe that someone who’s shown the willingness to do this in one subreddit they moderate has proven themselves unfit to moderate any subreddit.

Also, to loop back to removing comments, I’ve seen archives of about 50 comments removed by him for simply mentioning “Netflix” or making a joking reference to it. Some of those comments had real content and things to say, but were deleted for one vague reference that shouldn’t be considered even close to harassment. 

I’ll be sure to find some evidence to back up my claims, otherwise I’m basically just spewing nonsense, eh? There was quite a bit on a sub called r/GallowBoobArchive (which was surprisingly passive), but it got banned yesterday apparently.

Reddit is unique amongst social networks because non-employees, the subreddit moderators, serve as the first line of defense against harassment. When it comes to targeted or untargeted harassment within their communities, moderators can easily handle it by deleting the offending submissions/comments or banning the user. Problems arise when users venture across subreddits or into private messages or begin to use alts. Moderators have absolutely no power at this point and the victims are entirely beholden to the responsivity of the admins.

>I know on other issues, it seems like Reddit is behind. I find their handling of suicidal threats and ideation endlessly frustrating, especially compared to other social media platforms.

I think everyone agrees that [the decision to stop handling suicide reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9d8ho7/regarding_suicidal_users/) was a step in the wrong direction. Many subreddits lack the resources necessary to handle a suicidal user while others view it as a potential liability. It would be great to see Reddit adopt a more formal process for reporting at-risk users.

>I actually don't hate leaning more on machine learning/user reports for handling these things. It seems like a bit of an anomaly that is should have fallen to mods in the first place.

I still think anime fans should consider looking for better options when so much of the fandom enjoy sharing fan artwork, that can easily be endangered by this policy.

But yet, at the same time, general marketing encourages people to generally be friendly and approachable when they do speak. Now, that's not to suggest he *isn't* friendly nor approachable - rather, this demeanor can lead people to think they know him closer than they really do. And combining the two together can cause people to translate ""professional"" dislike to ""personal"" dislike.

And, in my opinion, I think it's really important to separate the two. There are some people I've worked with over the years who've been really great people to be around and to chat with - but when it comes to work they're very unreliable. Similarly, there have been some people who've been relatively unpleasant to talk to, but professionally speaking you can count on them to get things done.

Besides many of the reasons people advocate to ban lolicon are faulty.

1.""protect the children""

Well no children are harmed.  It even gives pedos a safe release.

2.""It might cause pedos to increase their urges""

Well, do you have evidence for this?  Do videogames also cause violence?

3.  ""You're a pedo!""

Not illegal as is being a psychopath.  It's only when you act on those urges.  Next, simply calling a person a pedo doesn't invalidate their argument.

4. ""I don't want to see it on Reddit""

Well good thing there are different subs for different people.  Don't like something?  Don't go to that sub.  Simple!

5.  ""It's morally wrong!""

Well so is killing people in videogames but that isn't banned.  Or incest porn which is popular on pornhub.

6. ""It's illegal""

Not really.  The US supreme court labeled lolicon protected under the 1st amendment.  

7. ""It's gross!""

So is eating ass but that seems to be popular nowdays.

8. ""It's weird""

So is everything to someone.

I don't like interacting with real people.  I don't like engaging in politics. I just want to be alone with my waifus.  I love how happy and cute lolis are.  So seeing one of the things I hold dear, being needlessly persecuted makes me upset.  No one ever tells gamers to reflect on themselves.  I'm pretty sure most of reddit would be in an uproar if Reddit admins were like.  ""Since we feel that videogames might cause violence we're going to ban it because our shareholders tell us to."".

Reddit was one of the few large websites with loli content and a great loli community.  Lolicons are always banned, even from porn sites.  Steam, Discord, Tumblr, Reddit, Rule34pal, Newgrounds, HentaiHaven, They singled out lolicons with this latest purge.  So it feels like a stab in the back.  To be thrown under the bus for investors when there are much worse stuff on this site.  I just hate hypocritical rules.  ""Sailor Moon hentai is banned but sexy cosplay of the characters are A-okay because they make money!  They even banned the porn sub to the anime New Game where all the girls are legal age women in the workforce.  I hate vague rules meant to only be used ban people that don't conform to the norm.  It's not as if I get enough flak IRL for being a weeb.  But now I can't be one online.

Since Reddit(like the 5th largest site) is banning it.  I fear other sites will crack down on lolicon harder.  It's more than ""well, there's plenty of sites; go to them!""(which is rude to say anyways).  This constant cycle of us moving from site to site.  So this irational fear of lolis is fully going to get them totally banned from the internet if something isn't done.  Next, if people get okay with banning drawings(literally banning something because you don't agree with it) this opens the doors for full on Orwellian stuff.  

It's bad enough I have to deal with constant ad accounts, data mining , propaganda accounts, submilinial marketing, virtue signalling, ect; on reddit and online.  But now we are fully reaching a tipping point on the internet.

Next, with these new rules pretty much all of anime can get banned.  90% of anime and hentai has underage characters.  There is no way to avoid getting banned now.  I've seen comments removed because they posted a magical girl transformation sequence.  Now, I can't even talk about anime.  Beach episode?  Banned!  Yuri?  Banned!  Ecchi?  Banned!  My favorite genre of anime: Mahou Shoujo, relies on girls.  So what am I suppose to do once my favorite anine gets banned?  

It's funny how you constantly hear about tolerance, intelligent discussions, avoiding stereotypes, fairness.  Yet all these things get thrown out the window once lolis enter the scene.  Like on Steam.  Any time a game comes out with anime waifus there are always a ton of insulting comnents.  ""This game is for losers"" ""Ban this game!  I want my violence!"" Ect.

2172,4ciup,egezxvq,t1_egengwd,t3_aq9h0k,1550097507.0,-9,"Because it's difficult to handle when someone's ""toeing the line"" with the rules in bad faith.  A very easy example is a neo-Nazi that's been a regular on white supremacist subs trying to post in a Jewish subreddit; there's absolutely no circumstances where that user should be welcome in that community, even if they don't break rules.  Their mere presence is an existential threat, and users of the Jewish subreddit shouldn't be expected to tolerate someone posting there who wants to kill them all.

Another example would be if someone gets banned in one sub that's affiliated with another.  If the neo-Nazi got banned in one sub for racism, every single other subreddit that forbids racism shouldn't have to wait until that user posts a bunch of racist shit to ban them.

The issue in both of these situations is that waiting for someone to post horrid shit first before banning them is that it's a purely reactive solution, the damage has to be done before anything can happen.  By instead banning someone for their participation in a hate subreddit, non-hate subs can avoid having to respond reactively.

The issue is not that racists are being banned before they can cause harm, it's that there's false positives.  Lots of folk will troll hate subs or argue with the people there, and if lots of subs are auto-banning them for perhaps even accidentally posting in a hate sub then there's basically no sane way to appeal that, the user has to appeal their ban to every individual sub they want to post in.

On the user end, a possible solution is to use a shared bot with a trusted team that handles appeals.  If you get auto-banned for participation in a hate sub, you appeal to that bot's moderation team and you can be unbanned or whitelisted on all the subs that use the bot.  If the sheer numbers of bad faith accounts shrinks down in response, then it's possible even to only do the ban by hand after reviewing someone's post history.

It would be extremely hypocritical of Reddit to permit racism on the site but then give subs shit for curating their own communities.

Reddit doesn't have a lot of cash. Responding to lawsuits is expensive -- even baseless and vexatious lawsuits.

To insulate themselves from civil liability under the laws of San Francisco, California (the venue for any disputes that arise in relation to the Reddit User Agreement), any ISP that hosts user content (i.e. Reddit) has a process whereby they determine that an account or a group of accounts has created cause to remove them entirely. This preserves Reddit's assets.

Account names use up a tiny amount of, but still an amount of, a limited resource on Reddit: **_Namespace_**. Subreddit URLs also do this.

The account names belong to the individual user, but the **_Subreddit URL_** ultimately belongs to Reddit. Thus, the utility of /r/redditrequest. Reddit generally won't take a subreddit URL away from the control of the people operating it (that's Reddit's reputation and part of their ""goodwill"") unless those people mismanage it in a way that follows their established process for shuttering any arbitrary subreddit.

Secondly, from a purely technical point of view -- the Quarantine process makes it less attractive to bad actors / trolls to snap up a likely subreddit URL, stink the place up until it has a bad reputation offsite, inducing Reddit to outright ban it -- then lather, rinse, repeat with the next likely subreddit.

Quarantine is a process that makes the process by monkeywrenchers of selectively burning valuable Reddit ""real estate"", subreddit URLs, far less attractive to the monkeywrenchers.

That process retains Reddit's ultimate control of the subreddit URL, while preventing the monkeywrenchers  / trolls from creating a durable reputation for it offsite -- allowing it to be rehabilitated in the future, if someone finds a way to reclaim it, or allowing Reddit to follow their own processes (not driven by the demands of trolls) on whether or not a subreddit URL needs to remain shuttered in perpetuity.

If it means I don't have to moderate all those comments myself, I don't care if somebody else removes them. They're a waste of space, and hardly ever original, clever, or well thought out. 

>I do think he’s broken rules in comment removal and banning people for having negative opinions of him, 

I haven't seen that in my subs. There are lots of subs that are pretty touchy on ""personal attacks"" anyway, but I haven't seen him do that in my subs. I've heard of it in other subs, so maybe those subs are more of hug boxes than the ones I mod with him.

>To be a moderator of over 150 subreddits is simply ridiculous.

I agree...I do it too. Granted I *created* probably over half the subs I moderate. A few years ago I used to love building communities when I had more time, which leads me to...

> No one person could devote enough time to warrant being on that many

I used to be able to lmao. I have less time now, and so I have been leaving some subs. Though I do want to rejoin /r/wholesomememes if I ever get the time, since it's so lovely there.

>He is consistently rude and disrespectful to commenters within and without subs he moderates.

PM me stuff like this. I've seen other mods do it in subs I mod and I've told them to knock it off, and I'll be happy to do the same to him. I'm okay with a bad pun or a silly comment stickied in some subs, every so often, but I don't like moderators to be disrespectful to users since *we need them* if we want the sub to run smoothly. 

>he uses his moderation powers to remove the rest cleanly and quietly

FYI, it would make a lot more sense, on a variety of levels, to simply delete the post instead of ""removing"" it as a mod. So I highly doubt he does this. I haven't seen any evidence of him reposting like this, but afaik it's not against the rules anywhere I mod, and I don't see how reposting your own content like that hurts the community? Just a silly way to get meaningless internet points, I think, but maybe I'm wrong?

>Also, to loop back to removing comments, I’ve seen archives of about 50 comments removed by him for simply mentioning “Netflix” or making a joking reference to it. Some of those comments had real content and things to say, but were deleted for one vague reference that shouldn’t be considered even close to harassment.

Yeah that post was a nightmare to deal with when I saw it like 10 hours later (after other mods Pinged me about it since I'm high up on the mod list there). We had a talk and I don't think that kind of thing should happen again.

>otherwise I’m basically just spewing nonsense, eh? 

nah you care about the communities and I appreciate it, evidence or not. But I'm not going to remove an active moderator who doesn't seem to be harming the community if some users seem to hate him mostly because he's so prolific (or for other activities not related to modding).

Then maybe you should be contacting the admins to change *that*.

Of course this is over a year ago so there's certainly more instances since then, and you trying to act like you're not aware of what TD does and throwing in a pretentious smiley is disingenuous. Not only do they make comments like these, but they doxx and brigade as well. It's easy to find this out for yourself if for some reason this isn't good enough for you, which you could've done in the first place, and you could also use removeddit to see the deleted ones if that helps. I'm not going to provide every single instance from that cesspool, which is why I'm not going to go around digging in there for anything more than what the other guy provided. Only reason I even did this much is because you seem to be implying that no such thing is happening in TD, which is incredibly far from the truth. I don't see a reason to spend more time than I already have citing every bad thing that's been said or done through that subreddit.

Edit: little bonus I found, this one's a screenshot showing encouraging doxxing and assaulting the person. As I said, you can find many more things like these if you gave any effort, it's hardly surprising from a subreddit proven to churn out propaganda and radicalize people.

>I love how happy and cute lolis are. So seeing one of the things I hold dear, being needlessly persecuted makes me upset. 

It's not the happiness and cuteness that worries people. It's the sexualization of underage children. 


>No one ever tells gamers to reflect on themselves. I'm pretty sure most of reddit would be in an uproar if Reddit admins were like. ""Since we feel that videogames might cause violence we're going to ban it because our shareholders tell us to."".

I already covered this. Videogames are played by the masses and everyone knows the implications of playing videogames and what they do to you. Because Loli is so uncommon, people are unsure. It also mainly appeals to the outcasts of society on a level higher than videogames does. That is to say, people who have not learned the importance of socialization, hygiene, or morality. Now that doesn't apply to all, but it applies to a lot.


>Since Reddit(like the 5th largest site) is banning it. I fear other sites will crack down on lolicon harder. It's more than ""well, there's plenty of sites; go to them!""(which is rude to say anyways). This constant cycle of us moving from site to site. So this irational fear of lolis is fully going to get them totally banned from the internet if something isn't done. Next, if people get okay with banning drawings(literally banning something because you don't agree with it) this opens the doors for full on Orwellian stuff.

Do you know what a slippery slope fallacy is? There is nothing Orwellian about this. It is not the government censoring to dull the masses, it is the masses enforcing their will for protection and ease of mind. It's entirely different. You could never have enjoyed this stuff in the West before the Internet without scrutiny. Also, larger websites ARE more likely to ban things like that to ensure the majority of their userbase is happy. Just because Reddit bans it, doesn't mean others will. Look at Youtube, it bans porn entirely, does that mean all other sites are gonna ban porn? No. 

>I hate vague rules meant to only be used ban people that don't conform to the norm.

That's life, grow up.

>It's not as if I get enough flak IRL for being a weeb. But now I can't be one online.

It's not entirely liking anime that gives people flak, it's just that weebs have a whole lot of other issues to deal with. And you will never deal with them so long as all you do is escape. 

>Next, with these new rules pretty much all of anime can get banned. 90% of anime and hentai has underage characters. There is no way to avoid getting banned now.

Especially since the Iranian end was quite critiqued on the post itself for being small in scale and due to the methods, in your words being:

>Unlike our last post on foreign interference, the behaviors of this group were different. While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.



It is fairly surprising that only these two have been covered, or are seemingly the only ones targeting reddit. 


Especially when there had been fairly [active news of a UAE and Saudi based online system being long established much in the same vein as the alleged iranian influence end](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/hackers-leak-emails-uae-ambassador-170603153956229.html)


Even if it's not a full report, it would be useful to have a report that at least covered some transparency on campaigns detected and origins of the sort, alongside how reddit is managing to tackle such campaigns. Especially due to certain tides of only focusing on Russian / iranian influencing has led to mumblings on certain groups being ""safe"" or otherwise protected. It would be useful to have something to let the users of reddit know if the stance of reddit admins is to stop all meddling from any state actors, and if so then has any such meddling been detected / tackled. 

***

***


On the note of manipulation campaigns, it would really be useful if there was some word on reddits stance towards corporate interests pushing their way into reddit, either through influencers or direct manipulation campaigns. does reddit consider corporate interests using either of these methods against the site rules and will any action be taken against such happenings on an admin level, or would it be down to a subreddit moderator level? 


***

***

Also:

Would you be willing to cover anything more about the constant issues that mods from /r/syriancivilwar have had with lack of reddit admin activity towards handling the constant abuse and seemingly existence from attempted manipulation by actors that haven't been mentioned in any transparency report, which had been passed forward numerous times by the moderators of that subreddit.. 

Specifically highlighted in this thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/aem37j/transparency_with_our_severe_issues_with_reddit/


**In Short**

1. Has reddit acted against any other state sponsored manipulation campaigns beyond the listed ones and could there be some more transparency on which states have been seen to be performing campaigns, or have only those two nations been found to be performing manipulation campaigns on reddit? 

2. What is the current line of the reddit admins on corporate manipulation of reddit, either via influencers acting on their behalf or through direct manipulation? 


 2.1. Is this being tackled actively on the admin level or subreddit moderator level? 

 2.2. If this is tackled on the admin level, then would it be possible for a brief summary on what sort of actions are frequently used, counters used, and perhaps who is most targeted as to assist reddit users and sub mods.

I'm adding my voice to the other voices calling for the banning of The_Donald, but not for the same reasons that most others give. And, if T_D is being actively monitored by the FBI, CIA, etc., then I suppose that leaving it as-is is probably the best choice.

Either way, though, I'd hope that the team would give these issues some thought:

Despite what some of the members and at least one of the mods has tried to say here, it is well known by most redditors that the sub is racist, misogynist, nothing more than an echo chamber, etc. I don't think any of us are at all surprised by any of it anymore.

Those aren't the things that concern me most about it. 

What *does* concern me are these things:

First, if one spends much time reading the sub, it becomes apparent fairly quickly that a respectably large number of the participants are very young; probably high school age, at best.

Second, any time that Donald Trump does something that *could* be perceived as a Bad Thing by his faithful and loving base, *someone* is in there within literally moments, posting a spin on what Trump has done that presents him as a genius who has just outsmarted whomever he actually lost that battle to, explaining how and why the Bad Thing is actually a Very Good Thing, and generally doing an amazingly good job of letting the T_Ders think that they reached these conclusions all on their own.

Simultaneously, a small army of other users immediately gets to work browbeating anyone who dares to question Trump's actions, reminding the T_Ders that questioning Trump's decisions is *not* allowed, even when the questioner is a Trump supporter. 

This isn't that big of a deal where the older T_D members are concerned--not for the most part, anyway. But for the younger ones--and no doubt, a few of the older ones--it is a huge deal. Many of them seem to base most of their ""social lives"" around that sub, and the sub with its shared belief in Donald Trump, gives them a sense of belonging and being accepted by a group--a thing that is lacking in their actual meatspace lives, so the threat of being banned, or even just persecuted a little, for the sin of doubting or questioning Trump or his actions, is actually traumatic for them.

The combination of these things is very disturbing, because it is, at the core, *no different from the way that Middle Eastern extremists have recruited, indoctrinated, trained, and retained their people.*

T_Ders most do not dare to doubt or question, because to do so means they risk losing their spot in the group that is giving them acceptance, and validating their own racism, misogyny,homophobia, etc.

In other words, they are being indoctrinated and trained, and I have little doubt that they would also allow themselves to be weaponized with very little persuasion required.

I know it sounds dramatic and over the top, but if one really follows the sub closely and pays attention to how well orchestrated some of these events are, it is nothing less than alarming. 

Again, if any of our intelligence community, or the intelligence agencies of our allies, are paying close attention to the sub, by all means, have them carry on, because I have very little doubt that intelligence agencies of some of our *non-allies* are watching closely, if not actively participating. 

But if the sub is truly being kept around because of this site's belief that people should be able to express themselves, then it desperately needs to be banned. 

Yes, the users of the sub would still stay around, but, some would then skip from sub to sub instead of being devoted to, and owned by, The_Donald, and would eventually assimilate into the broader Reddit population, while others would form new subs in an attempt to evade the ban, but should be easily recognizable in their new home, for these behaviors aren't something I've seen in any other subreddit, including everything from other ""conservative"" subs, to blatantly white supremacist subs. 

Give this some thought, please, and thanks for reading.

Now they’ve also added a self-censored Google Maps search, image search, books search and so on... and the censorship in some of these is very implicit (e.g. they don’t even add international publishers to the book search on Google.cn). What do you think is the right reaction from people to online censorship?

(Tor is a program that allows for completely anonymous Internet use, by routing your traffic through dozens of other machines.)

While I definitely believe this is true in general, there definitely seem to be some things that have slowed down.

I'm active in r/counting and r/livecounting, both subs benefit greatly from reddit getting faster, and on both subs it gets quickly unfun when reddit is slow, or getting slower.

This slowdown is noticeably affecting refreshes, refreshing a post, or your inbox takes several seconds to load, sometimes spiking to up to 20-30secs. This does not seem to be a general problem, as replacing url with url.json usually allows near instantaneous refreshes.

And on the other hand, there seem to be general slowdowns during peak hours of the day, with live threads allowing 1 update per 350-400ms per person this is quickly noticeable, commonly single Liveupdates are delayed for anywhere from 100-200ms to several seconds, a couple weeks ago even up to a minute.

Oh and while I'm talking about them, livethreads don't seem to be necessarily in the correct order (listening to the websocket/having the page open gives a different order than requesting updates from the API at a later time/refreshing the page), this might not matter much for usually usage, but it'd be nice if that'd be able to be fixed without introducing further lag. Also the stroke function seems to fail sometimes, requesting stroke updates from the API sometimes returns the update as not stricken.

And even if pages load, images and videos hosted on reddit (i.redd.it, v.redd.it), take ages to load, whereas imgur, gfycat and basically everything else loads instantly.

>Reddit may, at its discretion, intervene to take control of a community when it believes it in the best interest of the community or the website. This should happen rarely (e.g., a top moderator abandons a thriving community), but when it does, our goal is to keep the platform alive and vibrant, as well as to ensure your community can reach people interested in that community. Finally, when the admins contact you, we ask that you respond within a reasonable amount of time.

>Where moderators consistently are in violation of these guidelines, Reddit may step in with actions to heal the issues - sometimes pure education of the moderator will do, but these actions could potentially include dropping you down the moderator list, removing moderator status, prevention of future moderation rights, as well as account deletion. We hope permanent actions will never become necessary.

This is Reddit's ""out"", for them to take over subs and/or remove mods for pretty much any reason at any time they want, so the days of total and complete mod discretion in running subs are over.

As for the echo chambers, my experience on Reddit I have observed that the vast majority of ""toxic"" echo chambers that Reddit has gone after all pretty much subscribe to one spectrum of the political landscape, while some truly vile echo chambers, many whose users and mods behave even worse than some of the banned or quarantined subreddits, those subs keep running along just fine.. of course that the political leanings of those subs happen to line up with most of the Reddit senior staff means nothing, nor the fact that several of those subs have had and still have an active admin on the modlist means nothing either, other than sending a clear signal that those harassment subs, and that is all they are, are protected.

Reddit strongly defended freedom of speech when banning r/jailbait to ensure the site could remain existing:

https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/

> At reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone elses’ opinions on how people use the reddit platform. We are adamant about not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use.

&nbsp;

> We understand that this might make some of you worried about the slippery slope from banning one specific type of content to banning other types of content. We're concerned about that too, and do not make this policy change lightly or without careful deliberation. We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal. However, child pornography is a toxic and unique case for Internet communities, and we're protecting reddit's ability to operate by removing this threat. We remain committed to protecting reddit as an open platform.

When open sourcing reddit (reddit is now closed source) Alexis Ohanian made it clear that transparency and non-censorship were a motivating factor in doing so:

https://youtu.be/uo4O4T-7BiE?t=45

> We've always benefited from a policy of not censoring content, this takes it one step further and lets you see how things work.

Describe reddit's growth; spez says this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmeDzx4SUME&feature=youtu.be&t=219

> Another big thing we did was no censorship, we didn't care what content was subjected to reddit so unless it was like overtly racist we just let it be.

---

https://archive.is/kNnPs

Speaking of the founding fathers, I ask him (Ohanian) what he thinks they would have thought of Reddit.

“A bastion of free speech on the World Wide Web? I bet they would like it,” he replies. It’s the digital form of political pamphlets.

“Yes, with much wider distribution and without the inky fingers,” he says. “I would love to imagine that Common Sense would have been a self-post on Reddit, by Thomas Paine, or actually a Redditor named T_Paine.”﻿

> We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/

> We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you – the user – has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. When you know something is right, you should choose to do it. But as much as possible, we will not force you to do it.

But the day people who look at drawings is equated to be a danger to our society, is a concerning thought for all those violent video games and drawings of combat.  Or god forbid an action cartoon/anime.

Unless you draw some imaginary line between sexual and violent art thinking that they effect us in different ways, then the real truth of the matter is that fantasy is not indicative of some internal desire. 

To say that any art sexualizes a minor you would have to point towards a minor of which it sexualizes. That is to say an actual person, as characters are not people. To draw art of a real person would then violate the separation of fantasy and reality, meaning that what is drawn could have real consequences. This is why cartoon animators aren't considered dangerous murderers when their shows can be violent. 

The only laws in the US that I know of to contradict these statements start with the [Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Pornography_Prevention_Act_of_1996) which included ""is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct."".
This was however overwritten by [Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition) for being far too broad, finally with the [PROTECT Act of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_Act_of_2003) it seems they found a solid balance. Clarifying to prohibit virtual child pornography images that are “indistinguishable” from true child pornography. 

I.E. As long as you can tell it's artwork and not real, it's generally alright under the PROTECT Act. Of course there's a lot more to all of this, but that's the TL;DR.

To say that you're against the sexualization of minors is something I agree with completely and I feel your intent has been correct. Thank you for your efforts fighting what I am sure is way too much child pornography on a constant basis. I'm sure it would mean a lot to artists and gamers to not feel like what they enjoy looking at and creating somehow makes them dangerous or harmful because a lot of people seem to be blurring the line between fantasy and reality nowadays.",False,False,False,15742,800,1389590756.0,False,True

Even a beloved moderator of /r/Animemes was banned (recently reinstated after appeal) for posting a drawing of a 16 year old character in a bikini, a bikini which was worn in the show itself mind you and was in no way sexualized. A subreddit dedicated to pornographic drawings of characters from the anime New Game, a workplace comedy where all characters are adults, was banned because one of the characters ""resembles a child"". Isn't that just body shaming? Does all porn have to have big tits to not confuse the admins into thinking that the subject is a child? Your current policy is extremely misguided. Especially when you consider that there are also subreddits dedicated to real adults that look like they are children such as /r/FauxBait (obviously nsfw). Everyone on there is legal, but they look like children so why aren't the same ""sexualization of minors"" standards being applied to that as they are to anime/manga content? (don't take that as an indication that it should be banned, it *shouldn't* and that's the point) If you'd like some help crafting a better policy that doesn't criminalize things that you clearly don't understand, I'd suggest getting in touch with the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund who has a lot of expertise in this matter.

1. Which doesn't change or address anything regarding my previous statements, so I'm not sure why you're bringing it up. : I was just trying to point it out because it really changes a lot in my opinion. Lets assume you are French. How would you feel if r/france was all about criticizing the country. Now assume you were a french person in 1939. How would you feel if a large percent of the french mods were Nazis/Germans. Or if the default american sub was mod by russians and chinese. 

2. Then maybe you should be contacting the admins to change that.: I will do that but please keep in mind that these complaints have been coming in for atleast 2 years now. Pretty sure someone has already filed such complaints. It has gotten so bad now that they have a popular subreddit just to criticize r/india. (r/indiadiscussion)

3. Users have the ultimate power, they can stop posting on the subreddit, and use a different one.: I have know people to unsubscribe from r/india in about a month of registering their accounts. The objections raised are similar to those raised against r/the_donald in a manner. People are not only criticizing the mods but are now weary of the fiercly anti indian content and toxic environment present here.

Investing 100K in a company and then ""calling in the favor that you owe us"" in a few years time is what organized crime does.

China seems to be doing more of the latter.

Look, about 6 or 7 years ago I worked for ZTE testing cell phones in Overland Park, KS.  There were a few people on the handset side, but the vast majority of the two offices they rented were dedicated to trying to win the bid to install Sprint's LTE network.  ZTE and Huawei were lowballing their offers, and going by cost one of the two was sure to get it.  Then the government stepped in and said, ""No.  No the Chinese tech companies with ties to the Chinese government are not allowed to build a data network for many, many security reasons.""

So if China can't have access to the backbones of the internet, they will get the next best thing.  Access to the data from social media.  Sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and yes Reddit are used by millions every day.  While Netflix might use more bandwidth, and knowing someone's taste in movies and TV might be lucrative in the right hands, knowing where people live, who they are friends with, where they hang out, how they shop, what their political views are, and with Reddit, knowing a lot of their secrets is much more lucrative if you are a foreign government competing with another country.

Let's be honest.  Reddit is now forcing you to use an email address to create an account.  Before they wanted you to verify, but it was optional.  If you have access to facebook and reddit, then you have access to your reddit history as well as your real name, where you work, who you are in a relationship with, where you live.

So say someone is married, goes to church, works in a high profile job and is critical of China.  Now China has access to this information.  They can see what subs you are subbed to.  They can see comments, they likely can see the threads that you have viewed even if you don't comment.

So your wife gets an email showing your history of viewing R4R.  Or your church finds out you are subbed to incest, or traps, or something you don't want public.

That's just one thing that could happen.  They can also give you targeted ads.

This self imposed censorship is.  People will start believing things even though they are not true.  ""Oh, they banned lolicon, that must mean it's a crime and those who do crime are bad people!""  If people are okay with freely giving up their freedoms then politicians will use this to make laws to take away more freedoms.

>Don't kid yourself. Also, get better tastes

LOL, I've been watching anime for over 20 years.  I know my taste.  I don't want to watch those alpha male shows.  In fact I don't like watching anime with male protagonists at all.  But that is why I love anime.  There are hundreds if not thousands of shows that just have the cute girls and not annoying men as main characters.  You sound like those frat guys who mock any guy that doesn't like shounen.  I've seen this before.  If I wanted to watch anime about arrogant asshole men being jerks, trying to dominate everything or ""Mr. Nice Guy"" abusing girls, I'll just walk outside into society.

Companies like reddit have little legal basis to *sue* ABC; the best they can do is say “hey you violated the terms of service of our copyright tools, we’re gonna kick ya out if you keep doing that.” To which ABC responds “if you kick us out, we will sue the pants off of you because you are legally required to act on DMCA takedown requests”

The lawsuit you describe should be brought by the extorted content creators, because they are the ones with actual legal basis, but then you have individuals going up against movie studios and music labels.

There *are* protections built into systems like ContentID, and I imagine reddit is planning to have similar anti-abuse mechanisms, but those tools are often reactive because reddit is not in a position to decide who owns what—because *how on earth could they?* They only find out about abuse when a user submits a dispute. 

So moral of the story is: be nice to reddit, even if they don’t get it perfect, because they won’t, because they can’t. Reddit, YouTube, Facebook—all of them are caught between a rock and a hard place, trying to mediate a conversation between two angry parties, both of whom blame the platform, when they really should be blaming each other lol

The options available to big sites like Reddit are to comply with censorship laws or be blocked at the national level. It isn't clear to me that either of those is morally superior to the other. If Reddit were a top-N web site in those countries then they might be able to put pressure on the government, but I'm pretty sure Reddit is only big in the English-speaking world, and if Google search is blocked in China, people will just use Baidu, which is not only censored but also much more directly controllable by China since it's headquartered there.

You can't see my karma break down but I participate the most in r\hardware, I and can tell you that they are about as anti-China as T_D, and even they put that aside to criticize the article. 

Mainstream tech reporting is very low quality. These journalists are trained in journalism, not technology. I work in IT, and pretty much every tech article I read has some sort of mistake; especially considering that article is an editorial the the opinion section. Trusting articles in other fields of expertise when you shouldn't is a [common phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_amnesia_effect). And this is before politics come into play. 

By nature of the media, you're going to get more BS articles than articles debunking them. You'll have to look at the content of the article and judge it against reality. The reality is that ""1% stake"" and giving research grants is not the same as ""nationalizing the tech sector."" US technology advantage was built exactly on those things: national research labs, university research grants, [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA), defense budget sent on technology, the internet, [ex-military board members](https://www.nacdonline.org/events/detail.cfm?ItemNumber=55285), Bell Labs, [Google](https://qz.com/1145669/googles-true-origin-partly-lies-in-cia-and-nsa-research-grants-for-mass-surveillance/), etc...

It's not hard to link some articles that support a narrative. A true one, a misleading one, a fake one, a smear one that's weird but not really relevant. I can link as many articles painting Tencent as a prescient tech innovator or Amazon as an evil dystopia. That's the art of propaganda, and we should all be aware.

If Ohanian could have grasped the internet as it is today, would he have said the same things? 

When nefarious actors step into this space, be they corporate entities or hostile foreign governments, they have a lot more power now than they did at the time. Not only in the resources they can bring to bear, but also the science they have behind them to manipulate public opinion. Thanks to Facebook, they've had access to studies with literally *millions* of data points while Ohanian's time they might have been lucky to have a study with over 1,000. That understanding *alone* gives these entities the power to sculpt discussion on Reddit to an uncanny degree. In that environment without checks, is this idea even possible?

>We want to support as free and open a discussion is possible. reddit is a platform for having some of the most authentic conversations online, if not in the world, and I don't want to undermine that.

Inaction *does* undermine that ideal in this context. It's even more important to think about that when we know groups like neo-nazis or other hate groups are actively trying to redefine free speech not just as the freedom to say want you want without fear of your government but *without fear of facing any consequences at all.* Reddit allows these groups to form echo chambers where their ideas do not have to compete with the ideas of others, further isolating them from consequences.

When we *know* hostile governments, ones completely hostile to the concept of free speech, abuse the technology and science I described above to inflame, embolden, and otherwise increase the influence of these groups on platforms like Reddit, the result is definitely *not* a situation where:

>reddit should be a place where anyone can pull up their soapbox and speak their mind, or have a discussion and maybe learn something new and even challenging or uncomfortable

After a certain point, inaction, especially when one has the power to affect the outcome, turns to an almost defacto endorsement of these actions and ideas. It becomes wedded to ideas like neo-nazis *deserve* a place on a private platform to organize things like Charlottesville.

Admittedly, I haven't played league of legends in a few years, so this is news to me. However, there are a few things to note. This was on the Oceanic Server, not NA; which, as far as I'm aware, is run by a different branch of Riot altogether. I specifically stated in a different comment that I can't imagine there being changes for stateside companies, which was my original intent in this comment as I am American. 

Also, I read in the comment chain that this censorship is specifically to protect Chinese players, as they could have their internet privileges revoked if they encountered his name being used in a negative context. Although it was mentioned without an citations, it makes sense to me. Essentially, the idea is to prevent other players from griefing by spamming negative messages about Xi to Chinese players. Still bullshit, but a far cry from the blatant karmawhoring and pissing of panties that's been present this past week. Tencent =/= Deng's atrocities. 

>which is why it's worth asking the question, and certainly not alarmist.

I suppose I phrased my initial comment poorly. I am referring to the spam of Tiananmen Square pictures comparing that horrific incident to Tencent's stake in Reddit. To say it's in bad taste is a bit of an understatement. Asking questions is fine, but most of them don't seem to be in earnest to me. 

>how they're going to appease the concerns of a minority investor with much much less than a 51% stake

I never said that they wouldn't appease them. They have a stake in the company now, of course they will. But the options aren't either ""no input"" or ""Proxy Chinese Server"". I can't imagine Reddit will risk their revenue, *especially* from subs like t_d by kowtowing to China in a major way. One article by anyone on the right, and the shitstorm becomes monstrous. I think you're overestimating their present influence. Maybe if/when they have more stake, there will be a cause for serious concern, but let's be level-headed until such time that we have something more to go off of other than what has largely just been a karmafarming effort by a bunch of NEETs.

>I'm going to go ahead and guess that between the two of us, only one has ever been present in discussions with the executive committees of multiple multi-billlion dollar companies

And nothing personal, but 1) this is an appeal to authority fallacy and 2) I don't make a habit of believing claims of said authority over an anonymous forum. If you can make your argument more compelling with actual evidence of Tencent's meddling, then we can continue our debate, but otherwise, I'm not interested.

For example, I have a completely safe for work subreddit called /r/ToplessNinjas based on a pair of stiff pants that was standing on it's own, that is basically a place to post images of clothing that look as though they're being worn by an invisible person.

I'm also part of one called /r/ThinYourPaints about posting terribly painted miniatures where the standard advice for novices is always ""Thin your paints"" as... it's an easy mistake to make when you don't know any better.

Both are rarely posted in, sure, but they exist and have for years.

Now let's say a porn company started a line of films with storylines that were somewhat compelling, respectable acting, and just happened to have fuckin' and the whole line was referred to as Topless Ninjas as .. it dealt with a lot of sexual assassins who were often topless.

Or some podcast started up called Thin Your Paints (though there's probably a dozen of them already) in which people gave a lot of good advice on how to paint miniatures.

In both cases - I'm fairly confident in saying that the average redditor would be against the subreddits being seized from me and handed over to the companies with the much larger fanbase, larger pocketbooks and so on.  I was there first, as it were.  (That's not accurate for /r/ThinYourPaints as someone else started it and I was added in later, but roll with it).

The point I'm making here is - if /r/news was in fact started by some left-wing progressive type, who appointed staff from a pool of left-wing types who actively worked to maximize news stories that make left-wing ideology look good and right-wing look bad....

Why would the Reddit admins get involved?  Removing those mods and replacing them would be the same as removing /r/ToplessNinjas from me and handing it over to the porn company.

Or, in a real life example I'm tangentally linked with, the /r/xkcd subreddit was taken over by a redpiller type with ideology pretty much diametrically opposed to Randall Munroe (the guy who makes xkcd).  The denizens of /r/xkcd .... made a different subreddit and waited until that mod became inactive, requested the sub, and took it back over.  It's not idea, but that's the rules we've set up.

If you're proposing a Reddit where /u/spez or another admin not just can but absolutely will remove someone from their own subreddit if a certain percentage of people agree with the removal....

That's kinda fucked.

My proposal?  Ditch the frontpage system.  You sign in to reddit with no subs, welcome to /r/all until you start subbing things.  Or, better yet, /r/random

###1

In the case of removed comments encouraging physical harm and threat: if anything beyond just removal of the user/comment were, say, more [wide spread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopadvertising/comments/851018/fifty_of_the_worst_examples_from_rthe_donald/) on a subreddit, then absolutely the subreddit should be removed or action taken against it.

But you can't make the argument against one without acknowledging the other and expect to be taken seriously; and on a gilded comment, it's only right to make sure **both** are taken into account here, and in particular, the magnitude.

###2

In the case of a subreddit takeover, it still has to go through the admins. I honestly have no idea *how* they went about it, but I have no doubt they did this in a similar fashion as I've seen alt-right mods take over other subreddits: [by asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/).

It's also not a surprise the original mod (u/milespc) is not only vacant, but even a cursory googling shows they were a part of a [network of mods](https://www.stopfake.org/en/spread-it-on-reddit-how-a-fake-story-about-angela-merkel-led-to-a-far-right-cluster-on-reddit/) of subreddits that have since been banned or quarantined.

Thank you for proving my point. No other country really compares to the US.  If the ~~use~~ US can get away with all out war (Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq) or through CIA coups and covert actions (Chile, Iran, Syria).

None of those exist right now so I don't know what point you're trying to make. Furthermore most of those used all out war to initiate regime change.  The U.S. as you pointed out earlier does that and far more. Therefore there is no comparison. Once again you are proving my point.

I'm not saying it should, just observing the fact that violent conquest is incredibly effective - far more effective than the United States' method of artificially creating an allied country by dumping resources onto it.

The US has [raped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings), [killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/us-airstrike-allegedly-kills-56-civilians-in-northern-syria), and [conquered](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/americans-overthrow-hawaiian-monarchy) to gain it's power.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is an agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

Originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the agency was created in February 1958 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957. By collaborating with academic, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate U.S. military requirements.DARPA-funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as computer networking and the basis for the modern Internet, and graphical user interfaces in information technology.

DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management.

&#x200B;

\-On other websites I would see images and keep scrolling. On reddit there were a bunch of titles below each other, and I had no idea what that meant.

\-Clicking on some of them opened an image, some opened random websites, and some opened a page with the title and a bunch of text below it (comments).

\-Most of the titles contained weird jargon like TIL, TIFU and IAMA, it seemed like a closed community with a very steep learning curve.

\-Eventually I discovered there were link posts and text posts, only the former one gave you something called karma (what? seems important though). On some posts you can't joke, on some posts you can joke but not in top-level comments (didn't realized there were subreddits by that point).

\-One of the very first posts I opened was someone telling a super creepy ghost story and no one is questioning it (r/nosleep was a default subreddit and one of the rules is to treat the story as true and play along). These people are weird, is this a cult?

\-Oh yeah I guess there are subreddits, and they have rules. I have to learn the rules and acronyms of each I guess.

\-To see more stuff I should subscribe to some of the nondefault subreddits. This seems cool, but a lot of work. Oh but beware it only shows up to 50 at the time, so I better unsubscribe from some of the defaults, but they're default, must be the best (ha).

\-No official android app (at the time), there's a ton of unofficial ones though, I could try 5-6 and see how it goes when I'm still not super familiar with the website mechanics.

* All services under the Tencent platform [have a history of censorship](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/chinese-censorship-tencent-baidu/) to accommodate the Chinese government
*  5% ownership in a company is so freaking much that it's the point where you actually have to [file separately with the SEC](https://www.investmentfundlawblog.com/resources/investments-by-funds/acquiring-5-publicly-traded-company/) to allow them to monitor your activities, specifically because you have so much influence over the company at that point
* Reddit admins, while under the Conde Nast umbrella (which admittedly was a while go), actually *did* delete content critical of their shareholders

And beyond that, I get it. You're right. It's an appeal to authority fallacy. But your comment, that 5% ownership is not significant or doesn't impact business functions, is like claiming that 4000mg/day is a reasonable dose of adderall to treat ADD.

In fact, if you know anyone in financial services, you can feel free to ask them and they'll corroborate. Most institutional investment firms are considered ""big"" if they own a few *percent of a percent* of a company.

It's quite possible someone was posting in a sub with a less than socially acceptable idealism to defend what is good and right in an attempt to educate the backwards thinking people who partake in such echo chambers. If we let those places exist without opposition, unless Reddit quarantines them, they are echo chambers and they seem ""normal"" and ""accepted"" to others. That just helps them recruit.

Why should someone who has posted defensive comments in a negative sub be banned from a positive sub?

I mean, look up fascist, look how many times Trump aligns perfectly with fascist regimes, or the tactics he employs. You are the same type of moron that fascist regimes flourish under. Whats worse is you trying to call out someone else for being the same thing you are defending. You aren't brave, you aren't 'in the know', you aren't aware; you are a goddamned rube too far down the rabbit hole to realize how wrong you are. 

Also, there is a world of difference between the congressional baseball shooter and the guy who went to Comet Pizza. This difference is that no one was encouraging the congressional baseball shooter to do what he did, but conservative radio was all about pushing the pizza-pedophile conspiracy without any regard to the results. Both were mentally ill, but one was encouraged, and felt it was his duty to go down there vigilante style, because he had completely lost touch with reality.

Furthermore, the right is completely infested with imaginary conflicts, questionable information and propaganda but tries to claim that the left is the same way. This isn't the case, its just an attempt to justify itself. You can try and justify your hard-on for xenophobia, sexism and racism all you want, but implying that your bullshit is a legitimate viewpoint is reasonable is an absolute joke. This isn't a hear both sides kind of thing, there is reasonable, and there is stupid, and I am sick of hearing this stupid right-wing nonsense. 

You can wrangle your words all you want, cherry-pick your information, conflate issues and confuse the subject all you want, but in the end you are defending a complete and total piece of crap, and the turds that love him. No comment is going to suddenly make you use your head.

You said that regime change isn't something the United States is good at. My point is that the only historically effective and efficient way to change a foreign power's regime or government is through violent conquest.

>Furthermore most of those used all out war to initiate regime change. The U.S. as you pointed out earlier does that and far more.

The United States does *nothing* like the countries I mentioned. They didn't conquer most of the known world (Rome), nor conscript millions of their own people to charge at machine guns without weapons (Russia), or commit mass genocide (Nazis) , or try to go for the Guinness record of most war crimes committed in a single war (Japan), or even wipe out a huge amount of the humans on earth (Mongols).

It doesn't matter if these countries exist right now or not, historically the only way to alter a country in whatever way another country sees fit is to break it.

>The US has raped

To be fair, you can find single cases throughout the United States' history but most of those offenders are punished. The US has never committed something even .01% of the scale of the Rape of Nanking in World War 2. Rape isn't a weapon of war to Americans like it is in so many existing countries today.

>killed, and conquered to gain it's power.

The Middle East is definitely a shit show. Obama's presidency was filled with examples of bombing citizens. 

Also, the United States supporting a violent coup to overthrow a government sounds a lot like violent conquest being far more effective than leading from the shadows. You've now proven *my* point.

>You really have no leg to stand on.

Oh, I see. You don't even understand what I was arguing. Do you think I'm trying to justify anything the U.S. does? I'd like to see them not try to play shadow government.

The concept is very similar to the basic premise of federated social media platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) \- if one community cannot or will not clean up its shit, it'll be ostracized by others.  The end result is a well-moderated community where you, the user, gets to choose what rules you want to abide by.  You join an instance with rules you like, and the admin will use a black or whitelist to federate with other instances.  The admin/moderators of your instance can block individual users for your instance, but if another instance has moderation standards incompatible with your instance's own they can be blocked entirely.  If you don't want that, you can join another instance, or you could join an instance that just never blocks anyone ever, or you could even start your own instance on your own local machine - but you have to respect that other instances might choose to not federate with you without that promise to behave yourself.

Result is that chuds are a rare sight for most folk unless you specifically join a chud instance.  Harassment is kept low.

And yet there are tens of millions of users on reddit who apparently have no qualms or issues with all that 'censorship' that you're aghast at. The admins have also made it abundantly clear through inaction that they too don't particularly give a shit either about the situation of /r/india.

Drank beer with us, talked to us like any ""normal"" father figure, and even told us (after we asked ) that masturbation isnt going to send us to hell and that its silly to think that. 

The main point that the Jesuits taught about the Bible is that it is not supposed to be taken literally. The bible was written in a different time period and because society and attitude changes, the interpretation of it needs to change as well.  yes they dont believe in homophobia, they dont think masturbation is a sin, women dont have to save their virginity for their husband, and they dont deny that the universe began with the big bang.

The Internet Research Agency (IRA; Russian: Агентство интернет-исследований, also known as Glavset and known in Russian Internet slang as the Trolls from Olgino) is a Russian company, based in Saint Petersburg, engaged in online influence operations on behalf of Russian business and political interests.

The January 2017 report issued by the United States Intelligence Community – Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections – described the Agency as a troll farm writing: ""The likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,"" noted that ""they previously were devoted to supporting Russian actions in Ukraine—[and] started to advocate for President-elect Trump as early as December 2015.""

The agency has employed fake accounts registered on major social networking sites, discussion boards, online newspaper sites, and video hosting services to promote the Kremlin's interests in domestic and foreign policy including Ukraine and the Middle East as well as attempting to influence the 2016 United States presidential election. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked in a single building of the agency in 2015.

The extent to which a Russian agency has tried to influence public opinion using social media became better known after a June 2014 BuzzFeed article greatly expanded on government documents published by hackers earlier that year.

Uh... I just told you. 

A) Password reset. You need an email to reset your password if you lost it.

B) Lost username. Need the email to be tied to the account, otherwise it's impossible to find it again without remembering. 

On top of that, it allows contacting the user for important notifications, though reddit doesn't have much of that except a toggle for messages as emails. This applies to lots of other websites though.

> The user could just make a new account. 

Most people don't want to just make a brand new account, they like keeping the same account with their posts, comments, and karma. 

> People are going to abandon accounts email or not.

You say that, but I disagree. If it's telling them to give them an email, and they use their main one, they're less likely to make a new account and use another one. 

Just because it's not expensive for them to have tons of dead accounts doesn't mean it's something they want.

The truth is ""free speech"" means different things to different people. I was pointing out that conceptually when we discuss free speech, most of the context is about freedom from government retaliation, not private or personal retaliation. This is what our classical 1st amendment is about. I can think of no society where speech is actually unlimited. But even in its purest unlimited form, as John Stuart Mills argued, he still expressed at least one recognized limit on free speech: ""the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."" This is known as the harm principle. It applies even to our 1st amendment. 

Today, this ""harm principle"" is alive and well, and we constantly debate it. Evolution of society is really then an unending battle over what speech and expression is considered acceptable and what is harmful. Reddits definition of free speech was never really free.

**Black Sun (symbol)**

The black sun (German Schwarze Sonne) is a symbol employed in a post-Third Reich context by neo-Nazis and some occult subcultures, such as Satanism. The symbol first occurs as a design element in a castle remodeled and expanded under Heinrich Himmler during the Nazi era. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial mirrored sig runes, symbols employed as a logo by the Schutzstaffel. All subsequent forms extend from this mosaic.

Victim of this, victim of that, the persecution complex the last 3 years have been in full force. You idiots even make commercials with razors and push your bullshit. Every award show is about privileged fucks talking about their victimhood. Even Jay Z was complaining about ""white privilege"" with his 800 million dollars.

Here is your biggest error, the classic ""your claiming your a victim"" part. I mean you realize that many views on the left are about helping the disadvantaged, the disenfranchised and the true victims right? Wanting to help victims doesn't mean your claiming to be the victim. Also, Jay-Z can complain about white privilege all he wants, he grew  up in Bed-Stuy in the 80's and 90's, do some fucking research and find out how fun it was to be a black man in Brooklyn during that time. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Your ignorance is fucking astounding.

>It's you. This is something your dumb parents didn't tell you, that you are NOT a victim, you are in fact extremely privileged, the top 1% of the world, and yet with all these advantages still managed to portray yourself as some woke victim punching the sky. You're a total fucking loser who got the sad realization that the world does not give a fuck about running the way you want it to run. Keep trying to ban speech that you hate, and watch as Trump wins in 2020.

Still continuing with the victim spiel I see. All you are saying, in your own convoluted way, is 'your priviledged, who cares if everyone else is fucked'. You spout this bullshit, bitching about projection, but you are the one projecting. Your life is shit so you blame minorities, then when someone calls you on your bullshit you cant do anything other than regurgitate false reports, conspiracy theories, republican talking points and fall back on the classic 'blame yourself'. 

I hope one day you wake up with a deep and lasting shame over your ignorance.

 • race, 

 • disability, 

 • nationality (including citizenship), 

 • ethnic or national origin, 

 • religion, 

 • gender identity, 

 • sexual orientation

Yeah you're right, we would actually have to argue about it and discuss shit, so what? I'd rather we live in a society where, dear mother of god, **we actually have to put some genuine thought into what should and shouldn't be punishable** instead of just saying ""MY fEelINgS ARE RIGHT!!"" like the UK and the rest of Europe who censor free speech because it's offensive to some people.

At least we can argue about meaningful stuff then, instead of clearly banning **fictional drawings and stories** because you think they're too offensive. You want to ban stuff that causes harm? Great! The US law already has your ideas covered! That's why we don't censor harmless words!

You're saying ""fuck debate and reasoning, let's just go by our fee-fees! That's the best moral guidance!"" like dude, did you not remember how we treated gays during the 80s because of our feelings? How we treated blacks for decades? Chinese and Japanese immigrants and citizens, or Asians in general? We as humans did fucked up stuff for so long, in so many places in the world, all because we just said ""fuck ur laws and facts, Billy, I feel like them blacks aint human, fuck em"".

I don't want to see us repeat history again and again, letting our stupid, illogical, arbitrary, subjective emotions and feelings guide us. Blindly following feelings has lead to the worst shit in human history. Genocides, mass tortures and rapes, war. I want people to build on the amazing freedoms we've established in the US, where we let people experience life as individuals, not confining their thoughts, their ideas, or their speech to the standards some prehistoric geezers made up in parliament one day.

There's a million different hentais and doujinshis with childlike lolis, and a million more with adult-like lolis. Same with shows. I don't have numbers to prove that, and neither do you, so let's not just assume, mmkay?

The argument of ""nobody gets hurt"" is a standalone argument. I see this all the time where somebody says something like ""Yeah, even if these guys are racists pieces of shit, they deserve the right to free speech as long as nobody gets harmed"", and of course some dude comes in saying ""Hmm, I see your 'NOBODY IS HURT' argument. That sounds an AWFUL lot like something a RACIST would say to defend their speech, HMMM :thinkthinkthink:"" like, no, that's not how it works. You don't just get to assume shit because somebody is defending it, or perhaps just not agreeing with you.

The fact is that almost all law sides with the idea that a crime requires an injured party. That injury may be you, or somebody else, or the general welfare of the public/public safety, or the government, etc,. ""Nobody gets hurt"" is EXACTLY why we allow murder depictions in movies, and rape in movies. Wanna know why? Because it's SPEECH, my dude. It is *fiction*, it conveys a *message*, even if there's not a real good fuckin' message in ""human centipede"", it's their right to express themselves even if it's some nasty shit. The difference is that people in the UK think that words hurt the public welfare, and some people in the US think that's some stupid ass shit because free speech changed our society massively, allowing for civil rights and the radical shift in the US' ideas and treatment of blacks.

>Your feelings are also subjective

YES, they are! And I love that I can fucking express my feelings freely because I have the right to! I want everybody to be able to disagree with me, and insult me, and call me a dumbass, I'm glad we can talk about whatever we want! This is fucking great, don't you think so?! That's why I want everybody to have the right to express themselves instead of being censored, punished, and suppressed. I think information, ESPECIALLY beliefs (because belief/speech is the fundamental aspects of human/societal morals) should be free to exchange as long as you're not doing any harm!

If we said ""Fuck your right to free speech"" because white America finds the idea of ""negro voting"" offensive and abhorrent, do you think we'd have civil rights? Maybe, maybe not, certainly I'd hope black Americans would have kept up the civil disobedience a la Rosa Parks, but it's a lot easier to just not arrest and imprison people for having rude ideas, isn't it? Shit, if we censored offensive speech, Rosa Parks' protest would have been silenced.

That's objectively factually incorrect.

It is more than possible to select two races, ethnicities or whatever else and use objective data to rank them as superior and inferior to each other in a number of areas.

Define 'lesser' and then you can determine whether it's 'factually incorrect' or not.

Chinese people are lesser, when considering a taller average height to be superior, than Danes.

Poles are lesser, when considering IQ to be superior, than the Japanese.

These mods aren’t entitled to running subs like shit until they die. Being a mod isn’t a lifetime appointment. If mods don’t like following rules that stop them from powertripping, censoring, spreading propaganda, getting paid for advertising and general abuse they can go start their own website. 

Mods ban redditors that haven’t broken any rules all the time. You think that’s ok but you are against reddit banning mods for breaking rules, censorship and abuse? That’s hypocrisy and ridiculous. Mods should be replaced often. Reddit should ask for user feedback and create a new list of mod rules that are enforced. Subs should have their mod log opened to the public so we can see if they are breaking the rules and being abusive. 

Not sure why you think mods are super special and should be able to do whatever they want whenever they want. They don’t own reddit and aren’t even employees. They have no “rights” as mods just like you claim users don’t either. If the mods don’t like it they can start another sub.

Counter speech can take many forms, but isn't all counter speech inherently just the means to achieve censorship? Even debate is an attemp to prove the other idea wrong and thusly never to be supported again (leading to, effectively, self censorship by the person previously advocating for said idea).  

And yet not every idea must be challenged with debate. Social embarrassment and ostracizing are also an option. It is up to the individual to choose which method of counter speech is appropriate. Reddit and subreddit mods have, in some cases, chosen to ban content. 

It's all part of the same giant wheel that constantly moves society is my point. Sometimes its censorship, sometimes its ridicule, sometimes its debate.

To Reddit being a public space, it absolutely isn't. A corporation spends money to build and maintain it with the expectation it will draw a profit. This is *not* a public enterprise. It's more like a club than a park in almost every aspect. Clubs get to set their own rules.

You're right to point out that I could make my own website with my own rules. However the OP that I was originally responding to was basically *complaining that Reddit was creating rules about hate speech.* Isn't it more accurate to say OP could go create their own free speech absolutism website if they don't like what Reddit is doing? As I pointed out, that site basically exists and it's Voat. That site quickly became basically a place where only bigots hang out and nobody else. Without some sort of moderation a *privately run* website will devolve to that, as people will rightfully point out they're spending their own money to help support white supremacists by giving them a platform *when they were otherwise not obligated to.*

That last part is the difference between Reddit and a public space. No private entity is obligated to spend money on giving *anyone* a platform. When Reddit bans these subs, they're exercising their *own* free speech to express what they don't agree with.

No. Admins don't ban mods for mod actions, only other mods do. Admins typically don't insert themselves into how a sub works, that's kind of the point. If they have a problem it is with the whole community, not particular mods, and so the sub is banned as a whole.

> Mods should be replaced often.

Why? Subreddits need moderation. Turnover on mod teams means the new mods need to be brought up to speed. Subreddits already have to add new mods as old ones grow disinterested or the subreddit grows so there is natural turnover already, and you want enforced turnover on top of that? These are volunteers running communities, not a political office.

> Reddit should ask for user feedback and create a new list of mod rules that are enforced.

What mod rules do you want to see instituted? How are the small number of reddit admins supposed to actually enforce them across the entirety of reddit, since they are the only ones who have authority over mods in their own communities - except senior mods over junior ones, which is already how it works now? Additionally, how the hell are you supposed to create a blanket set of rules that apply to all subreddits wrt their operation when different subreddits operate completely differently, with different purposes, different permitted sorts of posts as determined by the mods that constitute that community, etc?

> Subs should have their mod log opened to the public so we can see if they are breaking the rules and being abusive.

Again I am all for the option but I seriously doubt anyone would use it. Mods are already subjected to harassment in many communities just for removing posts and banning users when it is entirely appropriate - mod logs are going to be used to harass people. In any situation where you're diving into mod logs to see what is removed it is probably already obvious anyway.

> Not sure why you think mods are super special and should be able to do whatever they want whenever they want.

They aren't and they shouldn't but they can do what they like within their own communities. If kid 1 starts a Chess Club and 100 other kids join and 50 of them say ""fuck you this is a dodgeball club now"" that doesn't exactly seem right and that's the concept on which reddit operates. There are a million subreddits for anybody who wants to tickle their niche, and if your niche is already filled and you dont like the subreddit you can create your own.

If other people dislike the sub - and in ANY huge sub you are going to find that, like /r/news - people will start their own if they think they can do it better. That's why there are tons of other news subs, many of which serve more specific interests or purport to be the ""real one."" If the big one is really so bad enough people will leave to form a new community.

> They have no “rights” as mods just like you claim users don’t either.

The creator of a communitt has the right to run that community the way they see fit. You didn't *have* to join their subreddit and you don't have to stay there if you hate it. Other mods do not have rights - they're subject to what the creator wants in the end. And outside the subs they moderate they are normal users like anyone else, and often inside of them too.


> If the mods don’t like it they can start another sub.

If mods don't like the way the leader runs the sub, then yes they absolutely can. If the creator of the subreddit wants to make changes to the way the sub is made,at the end of the day they are the ones to make that decision and to say they should go make their own sub is asinine. *They already did that.* Are you then going to show up at their new sub and say ""fuck you you're doing it wrong go make your own sub"" again?

A subreddit doesn't just appear out of nowhere. It requires a person to start it and build a community. In exchange they get full say over how that community is run and if people don't like it they don't have to stay. Keep in mind most sub creators dont just make changes out of nowhere either, they appoint people as mods they feel they can trust to help run the growing community and they discuss with them and sometimes take feedback from the community about changes.

I see you mentioning r/news and in particular you've posted about a post being removed related to the hate crime thing - well,why do you think that post was removed?

Nope! Youtube has never been a porn platform and doesn't pretend to be for free speech in all manners, they have a very specific scope of viewership focused on entertainment that more or less abides by the US standards of broadcasting. Offensive content allowed, but there's maturity warnings. Nudity allowed, but it can't be hardcore porn. That sort of thing. I disagree with their demonetizations, but that's the same as twitch's issue. Can't be fair and censor stuff at the same time.

Reddit however, claimed to be a ""bastion of free speech"" and has previously in its lifetime allowed extreme porn, allowed smutty stories, 2D furry cub porn (literally /r/babyfurs top posts are anthropomorphized furry babies, clearly underaged characters, being sexualized with scat and piss fetishes. Not banned yet lel.), nazism, conspiracy theories (censored by reddit according to their rules), and open hatred and belief. As long as you didn't cause harm in similar manners to the way the US law criminalizes harm to others via things like calls to action or direct harassment (brigading), you were pretty much free to have racist subs or hate on overweight people, or whatever else! It was awesome because we could argue with nazis and insult them all day! and have debates about communism and its genocides! And mock 9/11 truthers! We all had freedom to do stuff we wanted to do!

>Your outraging as if the entire internet has banned this stuff.

Maybe. I'm mostly mad as fuck that reddit is turning its back on its users and the principles that made it so unique. Reddit is one of the biggest platforms, and many platforms are following the same ideas reddit is with their censorships. Ban conspiracies, ban hate speech, ban racism, ban **everything**. Not all, but many.

>The fact that you think a gay/black person being shot is comparable to a single site in the entire internet banning pedophilic content is mesmerising and shows how little you are grounded in reality

I never said that? You're welcome to point out where I said ""reddit banning lolis is equal to blacks being shot"". You won't, because I didn't say that, but you're making it up to misrepresent me. That's cool.

>Just stop this conversation if you honestly think Martin Luther for fought black rights because the internet banned his post.

I don't even know what that means, but I'll try my best to respond. If we censor free speech and normalize it in society, we risk becoming like the UK or other countries that ban free speech. If we ban free speech like those countries, we will be imprisoning innocent people like the nazi pug guy, and not only that, we are intentionally suppressing beliefs (again, a CORE PART of humanity and human nature), individuality (subjective but almost every society has individuality as a value in many significant ways), freedom to protest (a crucial right in order to progress society), freedom to express yourself (a crucial right to freedom of religion, freedom of belief, freedom of protest, etc.), and we would be completely banning wrongthink, dissenting beliefs, and allowing the government to say ""Hey, you are legally required to accept this belief or you'll be arrested"" (by illegalizing conspiracy theories, you are forced to not question something, you literally cannot argue with it being truth and you will be punished physically, mentally, and financially for doing it).

If Iceland and ethnically Icelandic people did not exist, the world would be less diverse, not more. 

>The willingness of a people to live together requires them to share a common bond, to be willing to share their resources with and to make sacrifices for one another. It follows that they need to have some common feeling, to understand and to identify with each other, and thus to identify freely and willingly with the political society of which they are all members. If these conditions are not met, social order will be difficult to maintain without extensive coercion.

There is nothing controversial about the previous statement.  It is a simple empirical truth supported by history, witnessed even in modern day multi-cultural cities like New York City, where the many various ethnicities still segregate themselves, as a matter of preference, into their own ethnic enclaves across the city, for the most part.

Why is the existence of ethnic Icelandic people living together on the land they have called home for hundreds to thousands of years considered a threat to you?

Why is that something that feel must be condemned?

Why are you so convinced that the ideology that informs you is not the one which is evil and hateful?

Multiculturalism is an ideological experiment.  Your use of the word ""diversity"" has no relationship to the idea of celebrating the actual ethnic and cultural diversity that exists around the world.  It is newspeak.  It demands the opposite of true diversity, it demands that everybody be exactly the same, which is literally nonsense.

That's fine. Back in college the theologian's explanation when reconciling science with the creation story certainly sounded bullshitty and students we're raising very difficult questions on how that could possibly work. lol I don't think anyone was convinced.

The takeaway from all of it is that our ability to question God's existence in spite of Science, is better than blindly following a 2000 year old book that is out of context in the modern world, (in contrast with those people who call themselves christians and follow every single ritual and scripture but are shitty people in general). If you question god's existence, and ponder about the meaning of life and constantly think in retrospect about your relationships with people (and how god's teaching can enrich those relationships) then you are doing your due diligence as a ""good Christian""

The entire Theology course was more like Philosophy than anything else really.  Their version of religion is more progressive than anything else i know but they're a very small part of the catholic institution. It's a difficult concept/lifestyle to live by and i'm far from a good christian. Some churches/groups don't like us ""Secular Catholics"" not to mention i'm gay so in some of these conservatives  eye's, i'll probably burn in hell.

But the murder meme found a new home on r/the_donald, one of the largest subreddits. On Monday, other Redditors posted 30 instances of r/the_donald users calling for the same mass murders Reddit banned more than a year ago.""

The mods of subs that were default meaning everyone was automatically subscribed control what makes it to the front page for hundreds of millions of people to see and what doesn’t. In today’s political climate where the US government has multiple investigations costing tens of millions of dollars into political propaganda being used on social media to undermine elections and democracy itself I don’t know how you can support anonymous mods who’s actions are kept secret to run these powerful subs with no oversight. They have the power to control and push propaganda to hundreds of millions affecting elections, wars, laws, etc.

If we found out that r/news r/worldnews and r/politics were all being run by Russians that work for the Kremlin I bet you wouldn’t tell people to start their own sub. You are pro censorship and propaganda when it’s your side doing it. I’ve seen lots of shortsighted people like yourself that don’t have the common sense to realize that not standing up against censorship now just because you disagree with the people being censored will come back to bite you. Social media platforms have been experimenting with censorship for years now trying to see how far they can go without getting any major backlash. What they discovered is not only will they not get any major backlash for censoring people for their beliefs, people will cheer for the censorship and demand more. 

Somehow you are unable to the fact that if you don’t stand up against the censorship of people you disagree with it will eventually be used against you. It’s not a matter of “if” it’s when. You are openly supporting biased censorship which makes you a part of the problem. When they start censoring things you care about, things that may be hugely important and can affect the lives of billions. Nobody will stand up for you and you will deserve it.

Nothing you say makes sense. You are bending over backwards to defend mod abuse and acting like mods are ordained by god and removing them is the ultimate sin. I’m guessing you mod multiple subs and think us lowly non mods shouldn’t dare question your divine authority? 

Mods don’t run Reddit. They aren’t owed ultimate authority over any sub no matter how long they have been a mod there. If they don’t like it they can go start their own website. As a user I am free to complain about shitty mods ruining the site and asking others to join me in demanding the admins take action to stop abusive mods. If we see corruption, censorship and abuse we should demand that it is stopped. We shouldn’t just say oh well and tell people to just start new subs to try and compete with established subs that have taken the best possible name to describe the content of the sub. 

r/news is an example because the sub name is the best possible explanation for what the content of the sub is supposed to be. It’s supposed to be the sub for news. In reality it is a biased news sub because the abusive mods censor some content while promoting others. You only get some news because unaccountable mods with no oversight have taken over the sub and brought in mods that agree with their bias. That turns the sub into a cirlcejerk where any opposing views or “wrongthink” is banned and censored. 

If you are ok with nameless, unaccountable mods that could work for foreign governments or multibillion dollar corporations deciding what hundreds of millions of people see and don’t see. What is censored and what isn’t, that’s pretty fucked up. At least with other social media platforms we know the names of the people who can ban and censor you. They are employees that we can challenge or name publicly. They aren’t in the shadows keeping their identity a secret. 

We must rise up and demand Reddit introduce mod rules and oversight. They could be Russians interfering in our elections and you support that.

And does that make any difference at all? Anonymity or at least the possibility of it is one of the things that makes reddit so attractive to so many people since it isn't like every other social media platform where your face and name are plastered everywhere. And you want to take that away?

> If you are ok with nameless, unaccountable mods that could work for foreign governments or multibillion dollar corporations deciding what hundreds of millions of people see and don’t see. 

If you really think this is what's at work I dont know what to tell you. Mods are constantly targeted and harassed and accused of being shills and 99.99% of the time it is total horseshit. The disinformation campaigns being waged on reddit and other social media are being done by ""regular users"", not mods.

In the case of a subreddit like news it is never going to satisfy what everybody wants. They do what they can to provide a clean, productive channel for US news specifically to be discussed. This means allowing only a whitelist of certain sources to be shared since many are actively inflammatory or false and there are legions of people eager to upvote that inflammatory content, including those disinformation agents you hate so much and the rubes they have brainwashed. Posts like the one you posted about are removed because they're instantly filled with hateful comments - and if you're wondering what they are you can still go look at them.

> Somehow you are unable to the fact that if you don’t stand up against the censorship of people you disagree with it will eventually be used against you. It’s not a matter of “if” it’s when. You are openly supporting biased censorship which makes you a part of the problem. When they start censoring things you care about, things that may be hugely important and can affect the lives of billions. Nobody will stand up for you and you will deserve it.

I am vehemently against censorship. None of this is censorship of the true variety. Many mods inflict self imposed censorship in order to maintain an order and that makes sense. There is no ACTUAL censorship on reddit because **you can always go to another community or make your own to discuss things there.** The fact that we are openly discussing this now, and that there are popular subreddits on which people are discussing this very thing with thousands of comments, is an indicator that there is no censorship at work here.

> In today’s political climate where the US government has multiple investigations costing tens of millions of dollars into political propaganda being used on social media to undermine elections and democracy itself I don’t know how you can support anonymous mods who’s actions are kept secret to run these powerful subs with no oversight. 

If the US or any government has reason to believe disinformation  agents are at work on reddit they can request details on the user from reddit. That is not new.

> The mods of subs that were default meaning everyone was automatically subscribed control what makes it to the front page for hundreds of millions of people to see and what doesn’t.

Again, your problem here is with default subreddits, which I agree are a bad idea - and default subreddits ceased to be a thing 2 years ago. Do you suggest we build a time machine so we can go back and change that to be earlier? Or that we close down any sub that used to be a default, and then you can change your target to the next-biggest ones...?",False,False,False,760890,3501,1327976090.0,False,True

If you're going to make a statement like 'doing x causes y' make sure science hasn't gone through and disproved something extremely similar already. I.E. Violent games and arts. 
If you want to differentiate sexual art, you'll have to give reason as to why the reward cycle of violence and competition would be **significantly different enough** from the reward cycle of lust. 


On a side note let's add another point, why is drawn art under attack but not fictional stories? Why not rape and murder pictures, shouldn't we stop normalizing violence? What about role play of consenting adults? 

This has nothing to do with protecting children, to say that it does is an insult to the victims of such horrors. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent investment in China, that has much more censorship rules for art and any expression of opinion that they don't like. And to fly this censorship under the flag of 'protecting children' is a sick, twisted way to make the destruction of this sites freedom of speech sound almost noble.

We at /r/The_Donald greatly appreciate your feedback, although we find some of it to be misinformed. Personally I used to be a Democrat before Trump came along and made me realize that the Democratic Party no longer stood for what I stood for, so I’d hardly call myself “far-right”. Many others in our community have walked away as well, or were former Bernie supporters who have realized that he was cheated out of the nomination and have now come to understand the evils of socialism. 

I’m not sure which facts, “science”, and real world problems you think we ignore, but I have a few facts of my own. There are two genders, there’s no such thing as “settled science” despite what the New York Times may tell you, and the issue at the border is a real crisis that must be addressed. I invite you to watch the video on YouTube of Rep. Dan Crenshaw visiting the border and seeing how dire the situation truly is, or perhaps CNN’s Jim Acosta showing off that there is no crisis at the places on the border that actually have a wall. We are well informed and ready to help you be the same if you come get a coat at our glorious domreddit. You will likely find that there is no hate or racism as you have been told by those salty that they aren’t winning along with us.

Finally, I have reviewed my above comment and have found no blasphemy against the Lord.

Let me know if I'm off base, but you're saying that it's ok to criticize the religion of Islam because there are a large number of regions which use it as justification for hateful ideology, whereas we don't need to criticize Christianity and Judaism because their reign of oppressive and hateful regimes are largely in the past (as long as we forget about Africa).

My point was that if these oppressive practices and hateful ideologies were endemic to Islam itself, it wouldn't allow for peaceful Islamic societies without shedding their orthodoxy. That is demonstrably not true.

What makes more sense, and is supported by more evidence, is that the areas which allow for oppressive regimes engender the belief in hateful ideologies, and that the problems stem more from specific problems with gender equality and education as a whole rather than from Islam specifically.

Where you have poor education, little economic prosperity for the general population, and highly oppressive gender relations, you find a toxic cycle of oppressive regimes, regardless of their religion. If you fix those problems, religions in general become less hateful and less oppressive.

However this doesnt mean we can't criticize Islam, especially things which oppressive regimes utilize to justify that behavior. I have no problem with that approach. What I disagree with is villianizing Islam as a whole.",False,False,False,180370,10259,1297420111.0,False,True

There are situations in which I believe banning a subreddit is warranted. Specifically ones in which the sub in question promotes violence in a specific way. 

There are also other punishments besides removing the entire sub - however, t_d seems to lack mods who want to enforce those on the target audience. On the other hand, post anything critical of t_d, and your head will spin with how fast it gets removed and you get banned from posting.

>DOJ: 26% of Federal Prisoners Are Aliens

>You’re thinking of legal immigrants only, and lumping in illegal immigrants as if they are the same. 

Thank you for conceding the correct point. But this is irrelevant when we have the most filled prisons on planet earth. I disagree with quite a few different rulings and laws that allow young minority men to be unfairly imprisoned, illegals included. But yes, you seem to be correct on this issue, that is my mistake, I have been wrong before and will be again. That doesn't change the fact that when you target and track a certain *classification* of people, you will inevitable be able to lock a lot of them up. Same reasons we see such heaving incarcerations rates in heavily minority populations in urban areas. It is a self fulfilling prophecy, look for drugs, find drugs, arrest drug dealer, nothing changes. 


Edit: Also, 1/4 FEDERAL prisons, which only accounts for, 20% (roughly) of the total prison population of the US.

>You’re the one who needs to educate yourself, son. If you want to keep being a mouthpiece for propaganda, that’s your prerogative. Admit it, you never cares about the “concentration camps” until recently because the previous administration detained people at the border as well and I’m positive you never cared one bit until the media told you to be upset.

Why does everyone act like it was ok for obama, or any president, to do it? No one was talking about it, b/c the rates and amount of people involved were a fraction of what they are now, it was a selective process under Obama. A rule of law under Trump, that is the distinction, and it matters. How were we supposed to know? I wasn't ok with Obama continuing Bush's policy of bailing out Wall street either, and yet I still respect the man and what he did for this country. You can care about an issue more as it is brought to attention, that is not a bad thing. That is how rational people take in and process information. 

I am enjoying the back and forth, it is nice to talk to someone who actually uses facts to argue their points :). Even if we disagree on solutions.

While there are plenty of advantages to diversity, like increased language options, and wider talent pools, there are also a lot of cons, especially if mismanaged.

Throwing minorities into a racist tribe in order to ‘diversify’ them can be a really dangerous thing.

Communication issues is another bad factor that can occur due to diversity. A prime example is the Chinese population sharing servers with NA and EU in competitive team-based video games that require clear and understandable communication to succeed. The most diverse team will often lose. You can imagine how badly that could potentially hurt a business or service.

The increased cost and effort of managing a diverse work place in some cases is a factor.

Integration issues, such as culture clashes can also occur, which can create unhealthy competition for everyone involved.

Diversity only works if every person involved shares similar values. Cultures can affect a person’s values. (Hence the ‘we’re all Americans at the end of the day’ argument.) Diversity can work in America if every American shares ‘American’ values

That really didn’t take any hard thinking at all... Are you trying to slander me as a racist or something?",False,False,1550167446.0,6354,119,1412773934.0,False,False
5573,2725mo5b,egk9yw4,t1_eggxm6k,t3_aq9h0k,1550271482.0,6,"

Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam -- famous for ""Bowling Alone,"" his 2000 book on declining civic engagement has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.

The greater the diversity the greater the distrust, says Putnam. In racially and ethnically mixed communities, not only do people not trust strangers, they do not even trust their own kind. They withdraw into themselves, they support community activity less, they vote less. ""People living in ethnically diverse settings appear to 'hunker down,' that is, to pull in like a turtle,"" writes Putnam.

They tend to ""withdraw even from close friends, to expect the worst from their community and its leaders, to volunteer less, give less to charity and work on community projects less often, to register to vote less, to agitate for social reform more but have less faith they can actually make a difference, and to huddle unhappily in front of the television.""

The overall findings may be jarring during a time when it's become commonplace to sing the praises of diverse communities, but researchers in the field say they shouldn't be.In a recent study, Glaeser and colleague Alberto Alesina demonstrated that roughly half the difference in social welfare spending between the US and Europe Europe spends far more can be attributed to the greater ethnic diversity of the US population

We are well aware of those communities. While we appreciate their input, we also tend to find brigades that stem from comments or posts on those communities. Given their nature (often direct linking, i.e. not even using np links, to posts on /r/The_Donald) that is hardly surprising. We also find that some of their users like to make sockpuppets and then comment things that are easily bannable. They take archives and screenshots before they are banned and then post those archives and screenshots to their communities as ""proof"". Additionally, when they find an actual rule breaking comment, those communities tend to not report them so that said comments will stay up longer and they have more of an ""argument"" that we do not follow the rules. Given the above and the obvious slant some of those communities have, we generally discount whatever (usually woefully uninformed) opinions they may have on our content.

I looked through all of those posts. I did not see any stickied comments. If you were referring to the posts themselves being stickied, I cannot speak to that as there is no easy way to determine what posts have been stickied. I can say that none of those particular posts break our rules. In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/aq7csv/president_bolsonaro_of_brazil_discharged_from/) post I found a few rule-breaking comments that I swiftly removed. That was the only example of rule-breaking, site-wide, domreddit specific, or otherwise, that I found.

In case you didn't know, stickied posts on /r/The_Donald (and /r/The_Donald only) are barred from showing up on /r/all. Just a tidbit that not many people on this site seem to know.

I can assure you that myself and the rest of the /r/The_Donald team actively enforce site-wide and our own rules. Our own rules are consistent with site-wide rules and we take action against comments, posts, users, etc. that breach said rules.

We at /r/The_Donald love memes and love our President. We hope you continue to hit the ""deport"" button so we can swiftly take action against any and all rule-breakers.

The old lady was asked by the police to explain her position as they were investigating a complaint. No charges were brought. So what's your point?





>lol no you want people punished by the government for bigotry and holocaust denial, youre an authoritarian

No, that makes me not a bigot or racist. In fact actively I oppose racists and bigots. I usually find them to be stupid and poorly educated, and do enjoy pointing out the holes in their arguments.

I'm calling your bluff. You seem to think I'll go to jail if you go to the police as a victim. Report me to the police if you think I'm breaking any free speech laws. 

But you won't, and that makes you a coward.

Got into a fight outside the club, WWJD?

A decade or two ago there was an assassination attempt on the Pope (i forgot who), and he visited the guy in prison, talked to him like he was a regular person and gave the poor guy a hug, said he forgives him and it brought the guy to tears.

There's nothing socialist about Trump's policies, but I'm all ears.

> AND NO I GET HE IS NOT A NAZI BUT BOTTOM LINE IT'LL BE JUST AS BAD.

So after calling us nazis you now recant.  This is an express admission that you're using rhetoric and name-calling instead of discussing policy, reason, facts, or evidence.  So if you're not bringing reason to the argument why should I take you seriously?

I assume you're talking about global warming.  If you really want to have a side-argument about that then I could inquire whether you're aware of what the volume of the Earth's atmosphere is or that average global temperatures are presently lower than they were during the 1930's or whether you knew that the last time CO2 levels were this high was during the Quaternary Glaciation Period (Pleistocene ice age to you) and that CO2 levels are not strongly correlated with temperature but rather rising temperatures are correlated with elevated CO2 -- exactly as you would expect as the result of increased biological activity -- yet all you've got to back up your work is hypothetical computer models that whose predictions don't match subsequent observations, but no: we're the ones who ignore science.

The decline of Christianity is a widespread, ongoing phenomenon that is affecting the Western world, developed countries and denominations in the post-World War II era, which have shifted towards a post-Christian, secular, globalized, multicultural, and multireligious society.

We've also had orangered vs. periwinkle (which I don't know much about but you can try and find someone with either of those badges and ask them about it and the button, which was a button with a countdown timer that would reset whenever **anyone** pressed the button, but you could only press the button once. If the countdown timer reached 0 the button would get destroyed. In addition you'd get a couloured flare based on how much time was left when you pushed it.

It should be highlighted that reddit made no policy change whatsoever.

It permanently suspended people for posting content no more gory or ideologically motivated than other videos that had shown up on a sub that u/spez had explicitly called out as cooperative.

The only clarification was this statement:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/b1hugd/are_gore_and_death_banned_from_being_seen_on/eim289y/?context=3

Reddit shouldn't be permanently suspending users and subreddits for spur of the moment decisions.

tl;dr reddit hasn't changed the rules to ban r/watchpeopledie they just changed their mind on the meaning of their policy.

So our brain operate on electricity right? and electricity takes the easiest path. Neurons in your brain can change over time, and if you begin using a new path those neurons will actually begin to grow closer together until they form a bridge. This is obviously an over-simplification but its true, and manually making those connections grow is how you permanently change your habits. 

When you start, don't falter. Don't fail. and feel free to start small. MAke a list of a handful of short tasks that take 5-10 minutes each, and just do them. Reward yourself a bit after each one and don't try to make all of the change at once. The last 5 minute task of your day should be making a list for tomorrow. 

When you go to sleep think about yourself doing the tasks you set out for tomorrow. Imagining yourself doing things is basically the same as doing them, from a neurological standpoint. 

And throughout the process, don't focus on the pain of doing whatever task you don't want to do, focus on the goal of being productive in general.

Had I been a chef and interested in writing, I might have looked into writing cookbooks or writing for cooking television shows. 

I think the first two years of college are an ideal way to try a little of everything (but not the only way). I started out thinking I would be an electrical engineer, only to discover that I hate math. I didn’t know I liked writing until I took a few classes and discovered an aptitude.

Two of the tests are basically him showing you a painting and you have to be able to tell from a selection of 8 options who the painter is. And this is from a period from 1700-now. Class is him going over a specific painting from each painter and some small details about their lives. But the exam is a random painting and you’re supposed to have identified the style of the artist somehow compared to the 40-50 painters he has gone over. 

And then there’s the music portion, same idea except he has musical selections from composers. Will play a random part of a composition for 30 seconds and you have to identify the composer from a list of 5 composers and then the name of the composition from a list of 8.

I identified with the Democrats a lot during the Bush years because on the surface they seemed rather agreeable in contrast to his expansionist views of State/Presidential power; and calling out the invasions of privacy, and senseless violence he perpetrated.

Then Obama won, and the Democrats embraced and continued all the worst aspects of Bush's presidency.

There are a little less than 5,000 subs in the list, in numeric alphabetical order. 0-9 a-z

Just click the link to get a multi of them in 100 sub blocks

they have a list of the subs along the side that have a subscribe button next to each sub, so you can just go through the list and sub to the ones you want.

Wish the multi sub or custom feed was at a higher limit than 100 subs, 500 would reduce the nsfw list to just 11 multis.

 I currently have 5181 nsfw subs I'm subscribed to and the current limit would divide that into 52 multi subreddits.

 Ideally one nsfw multi that has all of the porn in it is what I'm looking for but it seems that there are some speed problems and maybe stability issues with loading that many subs in one multi.

 I noticed one loading speed problem was when I went and looked at my subreddit subscriptions list [you can view yours here](https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/) it took a long time just to load the text of the list so maybe a multireddit could just not load the list of subs past a certain amount just to save on load times of most visits and only when you click on show more subs it will load more or it could be a scrollable list that loads on the scroll.

 or an active list that only shows which subs currently have posts that are shown on the page, with a scrole the rest into view feature or view more button at the end.

> The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.

So why is there still no option to tell Reddit that we’re not interested in the roadblocks added by quarantine?  Why can I not globally disable these gates like I can with NSFW?

Labeling is great, the quarantine feature could be something that even I would be on board with, but its current form is absolutely a strong form of censorship and Reddit should be ashamed for foisting it upon the users when it once promised:

No, it's not. You can decide yourself if you want to change OS, or if you want the updates.

I get your point, even though you exagurate a lot. It's definitely not everything.

>It feels like imitating a layer of facebook.

It's imitating every single fucking profile on the internet. Every profile that has been updated in the last 10 years, at least. I still prefer it the way it was, because overviews are supposed to be simple, which is what's needed on a Reddit ""profile"", but they're definitely not trying to imitate Facebook per se, just every single profile that exists.

>Users should be able to build on their experience and what they know to engage intuitively with a new update.

They can. It's almost exactly the same. There's basically no difference at all in how it works. It was a bit tricky to make Markdown-editor the standard, but that's all fixed now and is flawless (haven't run into an issue in a very long time). If you know how to use old Reddit it'll take you a bunch of times to get used to collapsing comments. Literally everything else is intuitive AF. This is one of the choices I think they should have made more conservatively. Collapsing comments took me 100 times before I actually got used to it.

I argue this point because it's fun... They are required upgrades if you want to maintain reasonable security and the ability to use newer programs or the internet. Upgrading windows is something that is forced on people because they choose to create entirely new operating systems (which can be a good thing) over simply updating and securing older versions. If hardware and software didn't make incredible leaps forward this wouldn't be required to keep up.


What is something that has been changed in reddit that wasn't to increase space or appeal to advertisers? I can't think of anything.

When I say profile I mean user profile. Like facebook or myspace. The ability to post to your profile instead to a sub. They want you to use your profile instead of creating a sub of your own to make it more personal. Custom avatars? Chat rooms? These are the things that they have added to make it more like the social media I dislike.


I havn't spent a large amount of time on the new reddit nor do I intend to at this point for the far too many things I dislike.

But lets talk about collapsing comments for a min... I think it's a terrible feature specifically for comments as it only gives you the top comment at a glance. Read more if you want. 
How many times before that feature would you be scrolling to see something interesting in the child comments? Too many times have I found something valuable there. This is a feature I specifically take issue with (honestly I'm not sure if it's possible to expand all permanently) because it feels like they just want to push you from one post to another so that you see more ads without actively interacting with the posts themselves.

If we remove the masks of anonymity, it just takes away this place where I can say what's on my mind, even if it's wrong, because the worth and value of your ideas are then based on how many followers you have. 

If in 3 months the front page is just filled with ""influencer"" reddit accounts (i.e. gallowboob), then I have no reason to stay here anymore. If the thoughts and ideas of only a few hundred people out of hundreds of thousands are on the front page, that just makes it easier to manufacture the tones and positions of the rest of Reddit. We lose what makes us unique, a place where we can share ideas, and either be agreed with or shunned, and then being up/downdooted into oblivion. If ""followers"" are added we are only more prone to boosting the thoughts and ideas of very few, rather than the rest of the userbase.

I'm pretty scattered about this, I'm not sure if ""all of us"" desiring this is a good way to describe why this change is coming. This is the first I've even heard of user ""profiles"".",False,False,False,12652,6142,1450377742.0,False,True

Quick question -- will these changes apply to the old ""friends"" feature on the legacy site? In other words, if someone goes to my legacy profile page and hits that green ""+ friends"" button, will I be able to see them as one of my followers? Or is that ""friends"" function being kept separate from ""followers""?

Thanks for reading! 

As an aside, I really like the friends feature -- it's nice to be able to view friends' posts when I choose to by visiting /r/friends, without having them hit my front page as subscriptions.

Letting people choose to enable that feature would have prevented all the ""why are people following me"" questions that prompted this change; letting you see who follows you is just weird. It's effectively useless for anyone who doesn't post to their profile (since the list will be all bots) and it's detrimental to people who do (since users will be less likely to want to follow someone with this change). It's also going to be harmful to anyone who has legitimate concerns about being stalked online: they may see this and think that it's the feature their stalker was using, but no, that's the ""friends"" feature—which will remain just as opaque as ever.

Yes. That is the nature of free email accounts and quasi-anonymous internet services. 

>lock down follows

What would this look like? Instagram and twitter have this in the way of private accounts, requiring the person to approve all of their followers before the viewer can see any posts. I assume this is not what you want though, since it would remove your posts from the vast majority of the reddit community. 

>disable follows from the root user rather than the account

Impossible unless Reddit starts requiring valid ID for account creation. If it ever does that, the site will die. Right now they track it based on IP, which is itself faulty (people running out of university dorms etc often have shared IPs), and dodgeable (with VPN)

>Could we get a bulk-block tool, or rules (all redditors active in XYZ sub, Redditors with insufficient karma / account age?)

Let me do this piece by piece:

- based on subreddit participation - a terrible idea. RedditMasstagger is one of the worst things to happen to the community and it heavily chills exchange of ideas between communities. People participate in subs for various reasons - agree, or disagree, or simply just chime in on a single issue without caring about the larger whole. Seeking to ban people based on their participation in other arena is a bad bad idea for any community based on open communication.

- based on account age and/or karma amount - another bad metric that is easily game-able and discourages new users and lurkers from participating. 

- shadowban blocking so the following party is not alerted to the block

I am ok with this. This is fine. It's messed up when mods or admin do this to individual users and apply it across the whole site, but one individual applying it to one other individual is a valid use.

Start a competing subreddit with better mods and rules;

Whenever a tool is created that has an impact, toxic users will seek a way to circumvent. Ideally, raising the effort on circumvention reduces the frequency : if its harder to cheat, we get less cheaters. 

In a linked, technical space, that’s not necessarily so. Once a user group finds a way to cheat, they disseminate the method rapidly; for example Twitter had to deal with the (((dogwhistle))) mess a while back, and handled it with their usual flair and talent; by fucking things up and being wildly inconsistent. A single user designing a subreddit can impact the experience for those inside and those outside, the most obvious recent example would be with T_D coming under scrutiny for changes it made prior to quarantine. 

By allowing an individual user to set the terms on which their content is experienced, you create an environment that does two things; makes users safer to self-express, and fuels the echo-chamber politik which has had some pretty disastrous consequences already. Cutting a line between *you all need to get along together* and *if you can’t play nice, leave each other alone* is easy from the perspective of a single interaction. 

Deploying tools to enable those choices, which will impact the behavior of every single user, is less clear.  The tools provided to end users shapes the way that they express and interact with others in a space. The way users interact defines the validity of the spaces revenue stream. It defines the positive and negative experience of end users.

A keyword like ""tits"" would have probably worked. I think your idea is really good. I've had to make different accounts, and it's tiring.     

Edit to add advice:   

* Write them one message (make sure it is in writing) telling them to back off or you will go to the cops. I made the mistake of replying ""leave me alone"" or ""I don't love you"". The obsession makes them not recognize negative from positive. The fact that they are getting any response at all feeds them. It's about power. So cut them off.    
&nbsp;
* Screenshot/document everything. Some people say just block them, but doing so may put you at a disadvantage. I had originally blocked him. One day I decided to look in my spam folder, and there were 50 messages from him, some one after another minutes apart, some a few days apart, over a period of a couple weeks. At the time I'm sure it would have caused me great distress, but I may have also wanted to know he escalated. In my country, you cannot truly block anyone, you just won't receive their messages; but they will still exist in a spam folder on your phone. This allowed me to keep evidence and control when I looked at his messages.  
&nbsp;

* Don't wait to go to the cops. I was scared of the possible escalation if I got a restraining order-- I regret this. If he/she harasses you for six months,  then disappears for a few months, then starts back up again, it can reset the threshold of harrassment and make you have to build up more evidence over a period of time. When I finally went to the cops I was told they could have given me one a few months ago, but not on that day.

Even if Reddit became incredibly invasive trying to gain all information about where each account is from, the machine they're using and everything it's still child's play to get around something like that. Doxing and harassment and my sympathies go out to people experiencing bullshit like that but really it's up to individual users to stop this from happening. Both by not revealing enough information to get Doxed and if someone's harassing you continually you nuke the account. Delete everything and start fresh on a brand new account.

Having following isn't going to aid stalkers any more than the existing features do (Reddit.com/u/JustaRandomguy9999), and it provides useful stuff for people who want to see stuff users post in their feed. 

Is harassment THAT bad for you? What are you doing to attract that much attention? I've never had to block a user. Maybe I'm just lucky, but someone repeatedly creating accounts *just* to follow you over and over again is unrealistic in almost every case. Everyone gets bored eventually, and even absolute worst case, switch to an alt. Don't connect the two. Even then, you can make a new account. Karma isn't actually, like, real. Just internet points.

If you want Reddit to ""look into this matter seriously"", you should first read the User Agreement and Content Policy and Moderator Guidelines, and take those seriously.

Part of the User Agreement and Moderator Guidelines explicitly says that no one running a subreddit may claim that it is the official subreddit of the subject being discussed -- all subreddits are necessarily unofficial.

> Its pretty shocking to know that mods are accountable to none.

If you want Reddit to ""look into this matter seriously"", you should first read the User Agreement and Content Policy and Moderator Guidelines, and take those seriously.

Moderators are restricted to the actions they can take by the laws of the jurisdiction of San Francisco, California, United States of America, and by the contractual strictures of the User Agreement and Content Policy. If you want to know what those are, read the law and the User Agreement and Content Policy -- or hire an attorney to read them for you.

> So basically they can just ban whoever they want based on their whims

Reddit moderators are volunteers, and are also Reddit Users, and are afforded the same freedom of speech and freedom of association that you yourself are afforded. They are bound by the same city, state, and federal laws that you are (which you agreed to under the User Agreement).

> I would be happy if Reddit's official employees handles official subs who undergoes some moderation training

Reddit is not going to mandate or offer training to moderators on how to operate their subreddits. They have the Moderator Guidelines, and Reddiquette, and there are unofficial subreddits for user support for AutoModerator and user-created moderation tools. Reddit keeps users and moderators at arm's length, and is not a judge, deciding whose speech and associations are and are not appropriate and right.

Again: If you are unhappy with how a particular subreddit's moderation team has treated you, realise that they're volunteers-- not Reddit employees -- and have no duty to you except whatever duty you can prove to a court of law, if you can persuade law enforcement or can pay for a civil lawsuit.

Yeah, because this feature is still in beta, they said once it rolls out in 3 months, you'll easily be able to track who follows you.

>If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released.

Your complaint won't matter when it's fully released. Further, I am in complete disagreeance with everything about adding profiles, I don't approve of the beta program and I think it's really underhanded how they are implementing this. I'm not just complaining about profiles being fully released in 3 months, I'm complaining about *everything associated with it.*

What hits the front page of reddit should remain the same for everyone within the constraints of subreddits they are subscribed to(or have removed from circulation), atleast with subreddits what hits the top is decided by the community, with profiles, it is up to one person, and a cult following.

Seems unlikely but that's literally how it works.  The post-to-profile feature basically adds a subreddit to your profile.  Following your profile just subscribes you to that subreddit.  The only way you'll also be subscribed to posts in other subreddits is if you are subscribed to those subreddits anyway.

This is so not true. A person gets bombarded with official sub of particular region when he visits the homepage of Reddit. He/she gets to see subreddits which are promoted by Reddit themselves.

Have seen many mods themselves don't adhere to rules and guidelines of their own subreddit let alone of Reddit. 

If you gonna throw user agreement bs than I guess there's no difference between Reddit and FB policies. Google/Apple/many online companies have been punished by the court despite them saying they are adhering to their rules and agreement. Its not some God's words which can't be challenged. We all know that so called user agreement and policies is to safeguard to interest of that particular company and not of the users.
 
I guess this is the same rhetoric a lawyer would throw in front of gullible user who just wants to participate in discussion rather get into legal arguments. 

>Reddit is not going to mandate or offer training to moderators on how to operate their subreddits. They have the Moderator Guidelines, and Reddiquette, and there are unofficial subreddits for user support for AutoModerator and user-created moderation tools. Reddit keeps users and moderators at arm's length, and is not a judge, deciding whose speech and associations are and are not appropriate and right.

Well they have to imo since they are promoting particular subreddits as an official one for users coming from a particular region. Also there's a reason why many subs like r-politics are becoming circle jerks and they wouldn't be thriving without support of Reddit officials. Reddit have to intervene cause lately subreddit like r-india becoming intolerant towards plural thoughts. User gets banned without any explanation and gets no response from the mods. We don't even know whether mods are even Indians who knows anything about India and its geopolitics or culture. If they are moderating a particular subreddit, they would have to learn moderation ethics in the first place if Reddit is serious about maintaining quality of their website and Goodwill. Its like giving Nuclear codes to bunch of 20yo stubborns who don't how to handle it properly.

Reddit's employees do not have the time, nor the duty / responsibility, to clear model agreements and copyright on every work posted to the site.

For Reddit to take action on a given piece of media, they need **_proof_** (to a legally reliable standard of proof) that someone with a **_legitimate interest_** under the law, in the media, has a **_right_** to prevent it from being posted to / disseminated on / licensed to Reddit. That person has to come forward. If they don't, Reddit has no legal way to say one way or another. The User Agreement leaves the liability and responsibility for clearing rights to a work, on the individual uploader / poster / user. If Reddit took that up, it would cost literally millions of dollars in labour and potentially billions in legal liability.

> and letting a post of the N word stay up

Reddit doesn't ""let"" those posts stay up. Reddit doesn't take an editorial or publisher stance on what's hosted on their platform, so that they don't lose DMCA Safe Harbour. If they started ""letting"" those posts stay up (or ""not letting"" them stay up by proactively taking them down, or in response to user reports) -- they would lose DMCA Safe Harbour. And then every single copyright violation on this site, they'd be liable for -- trillions of dollars of liability.

Reddit's admins aren't more concerned about curse words. Reddit's admins are concerned about people who don't understand that ""No"" means ""No"", not ""Please send us a lot of harassment for disinviting you"".

It's required per contractual terms in the User Agreement.

> A person gets bombarded with official sub of particular region when he visits the homepage of Reddit.

Never happened. They might get shown subreddits that are popular with other users in the region they specify when they sign up, or the region their IP address is assigned to -- but they're never being pushed to any ""official"" subreddits.

> Have seen many mods themselves don't adhere to rules and guidelines of their own subreddit

Most subreddits have a final rule to the effect of ""The interpretation of the rules is left to the discretion of the moderators"". 

> let alone of Reddit

https://reddit.com/report -- tell the admins exactly where and how they violated the User Agreement / Content Policy.

> If you gonna throw user agreement bs

These are contractually enforceable terms. You agreed to them.

> Google/Apple/many online companies have been punished by the court 

And you're welcome to file suit, in the courts of San Francisco, California (the venue you agreed to in the User Agreement) if you think you can prove a contractual violation (good luck proving a contractual violation on a contract with no consideration) or a breach of criminal law (good luck with that).

> We all know that so called user agreement and policies is to safeguard to interest of that particular company and not of the users.

The User Agreement for Reddit which I read and agreed to protects both Reddit's interests and mine. If you would like to understand how it protects yours, hire an attorney.

> Well they have to imo since they are promoting particular subreddits as an official one for users coming from a particular region.

A: No, they don't;  
B: None of the subreddits are official. Even if they claim they're official -- they're not. If you find a subreddit claiming it's an official subreddit, https://www.reddit.com/report

> subs like r-politics are becoming circle jerks and they wouldn't be thriving without support of Reddit officials

You might not understand the nature of American politics.

No, Reddit doesn't have to intervene. If you are unhappy about the way the people running /r/india are running it, create another subreddit for your voice and the voice of people who want to help you.

> User gets banned without any explanation and gets no response from the mods.

That's often typical. If a subreddit has a posted rule, and a user breaks that posted rule -- or is abusive, or rude, or attempts to disrupt a discussion, or spams, or violates the Reddit User Agreement or Content Policy or any number of other things, the moderators are going to ban that user without warning. 

> We don't even know whether mods are even Indians who knows anything about India and its geopolitics or culture.

So make another subreddit, where the moderators are willing to stake their reputations and names.

> If they are moderating a particular subreddit, they would have to learn moderation ethics in the first place

A: They don't have to learn any ethical principles to moderate a subreddit; They do have to abide by specific legalistic contractual terms in the User Agreement.

B: There's no professional discipline, nor academic discipline, of ""moderation ethics"" -- there's political science and psychotherapy training and the ethics of teaching, and journalistic ethics, that could be applied -- but subreddit moderators don't have an explicit fiduciary duty to their audience / community members, under US law, and moderators are volunteers -- unpaid volunteers. The few who do have training in ethics are professionals running small, niche subreddits in their spare time, and retired academics.

>  if Reddit is serious about maintaining quality of their website and Goodwill.

Reddit's quality and goodwill is that they provide an infrastructure for ""authentic"" discussion and don't intervene in those discussions except where US / California law mandates that they must, to avoid criminal / civil liability or imminent harm -- where imminent harm means ""someone is about to be physically assaulted or killed"".

So why a particular sub is being given unfair advantage over other subs from the same region and is being called an official sub? If they can quarantine a sub from their homepage surely they are promoting subreddits on their homepage. Especially for users coming from different regions like India.

>Never happened. They might get shown subreddits that are popular with other users in the region they specify when they sign up, or the region their IP address is assigned to -- but they're never being pushed to any ""official"" subreddits.

Yes. They are. May be you are not from India. An Indian visitor gets bombarded with r/india posts without his consent when he visits the home page of the reddit. Officially or unofficially, Reddit is giving advantage to that sub.

>Most subreddits have a final rule to the effect of ""The interpretation of the rules is left to the discretion of the moderators"". 

Means no accountability what so ever. Got it.

>And you're welcome to file suit, in the courts of San Francisco, California (the venue you agreed to in the User Agreement) if you think you can prove a contractual violation (good luck proving a contractual violation on a contract with no consideration) or a breach of criminal law (good luck with that).

Wow. So much for only proposing for transperancy and accountability. Yeah this is how lawyers try to make those arguments because that's their job but we normal users only want reddit to be responsible and fair.


>None of the subreddits are official. Even if they claim they're official -- they're not. If you find a subreddit claiming it's an official subreddit, https://www.reddit.com/report

Done many times. No action from Reddit.

Sure enough to understand how that sub becoming worse and worse and still Reddit promotes it on their homepage. Still gives that sub exposure despite knowing the whole sub is now ugly and pushes only one sided ugly narrative.

Those handling r/India might not understand Indian politics and culture but they still gets to dictate things based on their narrow understanding.

>No, Reddit doesn't have to intervene. If you are unhappy about the way the people running /r/india are running it, create another subreddit for your voice and the voice of people who want to help you.

You are saying they don't have to but Reddit has intervened. They have to intervene if there's some serious abuse of powers by the moderators. Like I said earlier most users just want to participate in the sub where discussions are happening. If Reddit only shows posts from one particular sub on their home page for viewers coming from certain region than that viewer is bound to go to that sub only and doesn't get to know about other subs. Giving undue advantage to one sub does indeed violates net neutrality rules imo.

>That's often typical. If a subreddit has a posted rule, and a user breaks that posted rule -- or is abusive, or rude, or attempts to disrupt a discussion, or spams, or violates the Reddit User Agreement or Content Policy or any number of other things, the moderators are going to ban that user without warning. 

Mods are banning people just for mere counter arguments which doesn't fit in the narrative they want to peddle. Many users have been experiencing the similar thing in that subreddit. So a moderator can ban anyone based on his whims but he isn't answerable to any. I guess that's explains their erratic behavior. Its astonishing that you are finding no problems with the way Reddit is being moderated.

Many users like following have reported abusive behavior by moderators.

The follow feature is basically a subscribe/join button to the posts you make to your profile.  So, if you don't use that feature, followers don't mean anything but a count.  You can continue using Reddit normally and others who want to have their own personal subreddit on their profile can do so.

I'm seeing the increased trend of you really not reading into context clues. Lets step this back and highlight why it is a problem now instead of one before.

-You can now see who is following you

-Most users did not know this is a feature

-This feature will now begin to become advertised once it moves out of beta

-A large amount of users will learn that it is possible to become notified insite when someone posts. 

It has become infinitely easier to follow someone on an alt and harrass them on another account and dodge blocks now. It makes refreshing their page every few hours for posts pointless. Hence the increased potential.

> In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, not even to unlimited speech on one's own tenant-property. One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They – the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism – will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order.

I agree that border control is violent, but not anymore so than other coercive government policy.  The core of the ideology is the same as those who believe in the paradox of tolerance.

They take the view that the ideology of communism etc... are so destructive to their view of society that they cannot even be advocated for and must be forcefully suppressed.

I think that’s absurd, just as absurd those using the paradox of tolerance to suggest that censorship will lead to freedom of speech.

If you don’t know/are unwilling to provide anything that’d prove to me the validation of your comments regarding him (despite you, just now, claiming that it exists thanks to these “researchers”) then how will I believe you? Which in turn, makes it impossible for me to ignore evidence since, again, you don’t know/won’t provide me any.

And why are you assuming so many of these things about me? I simply asked you to provide evidence to your claims. Why are you so sure I’ll ignore said evidence when you don’t even know me and when almost none of my comment history line up with the behavior of that kind of people? Hell, I’m not trying to be the decider of nothing, nor to be given credence of that title. Wtf are you on?

Again, I have no reason to ignore evidence, if you provide me some, I can admit that you’re right. And Jesus Christ, what the hell did I say to make you think I’m trying to spread some kind of propaganda? Because I, apparently, disagree with you? Because I act like someone that did try to spread propaganda? If that’s the case, then how do you even know I’m like them? What are you basing these assumptions off?

”At one point, I did believe that -- before T_D and CringeAnarchy overran the website and chased off most of the people I'd like to talk to, helped put a doddering racist rapist fascist egotist in the White House, and have sustained a campaign to overload the support staff of the website with a mountain of civil torts and criminal speech acts and the worst behaviour of humanity.”

Oh god, you’re one of those, this conversation might as well end now because I really don’t wanna talk politics with one of you people, or anyone for that matter. Look, I don’t give a flying fuck about politics, but I can tell you with confidence that Reddit hasn’t been overrun by anything, you can still find people of all political ideologies, maybe more or less of one ideology depending on the sub, but you’ll still find them. Also, what the hell do you mean by “chased off”? Whatever happened to those people, if they decided to dwell on a sub they knew had people who wouldn’t share the same views as them, that’s on them. Also, I’m sorry, I haven’t seen any “campaign” being sustained here, probably because I don’t dwell in politics’s territory, nor any sub regarding that matter. You should probably leave whatever sub sustains this “campaign” instead of looking for opportunities to be pissed off. I’m sorry, but “the worst behavior of humanity”? I’m no Trump supporter, hell, I’m not from, nor do I live in the US, but you can’t tell me he’s worse, or even on the same level as a scumbag like Hitler or Kim Jong Un.

I mean, it's not really just for stalking and porn. Just because you can't think of uses for it doesn't mean other people don't use it for other reasons. It's not even particularly useful for stalking, if we're being frank. It's easier to just go to your user page (which you can use a bot or website service to notify you when it changes, which is much more effective than following) and read all that stuff than to occasionally see something in my feed.

I really don't get the concern. If you're expecting a public forum on the internet to be a safe space, holy hell have I got some bad news. 

If you're concerned about stalking and harassment, there are far more effective, easier ways than following someone on Reddit. I don't see how the function adds an ability that isn't there.

A user cross posted a link to a post of mine in a separate sub to an incel community saying something like ""A Stacy on xyz sub says blah blah blah"" (note: Stacey is the term they use to refer to women). And then, immediately after, my post went from a reasonable number of upvotes (like, I don't know, 50-60 upvotes which was a lot for a small sub) to many negative downvotes. It was barraged with insulting comments, and I started receiving private messages from some of the same users posting insulting comments.

My post went from being well received and upvoted to clearly not after it was cross posted to the incel sub. I mean... come on.

As for your final point, most leftists I know are major proponents of civil liberties, believing that the parliamentary system has been a failure in representing consensus democracy. The world, particularly the US, has not been tolerant to leftism whatsoever in the 20th century. For example, many laws unfairly discriminating against anarchists were passed in the 20s and 30s, this drove the membership and collective bargaining power of many leftist organisations, such as the IWW, whom were instrumental in increasing worker rights and allowed many disadvantaged workers greater collective bargaining power against their bosses. Other superpowers have been even less tolerant of leftism during the 20th century, such as the USSR. 
>""Between March 12 and 14, 1919, in the city of Astrakhan, the Cheka executed between 2000 and 4000 striking workers and Red Army soldiers who had joined them. Many were thrown into the river with stones tied to their necks, while the rest were killed by firing squad. To give an idea of the primarily anti-worker and counterrevolutionary scope of the Communists’ activities, during the same repressive campaign they killed a significantly smaller number of bourgeoisie, between 600 and 1000. The primary victims of the Bolsheviks were from the popular classes.""

This particular nation-state has had more than a few intolerances towards leftism, such as their active fighting against the Republican militias of CNT/FAI in revolutionary Catalonia, or their violent subjugation of the black army leading the Ukranian free territories.

No i'm not. Don't misrepresent my argument. I'm saying reddit is giving an additonal, more useful and persistent tool in site to allow someone to harrass another user. Providing an opt-out would reduce their accessibility to the one specific tool reddit provides, which is coincidentally currently the most powerful since it provides notifications. It doesn't reduce accesibility to other tools, what?

>People who want to harass others are most often highly motivated in doing so. Having to briefly go to a different website is hardly a deterrent imo.

Get this, it still is a deterrent having to go off site or use a script. If you make something more convenient it will most likely be used more often. there could be a scenario where someone who would have let a scenario go decided to just follow the account instead.

My understanding of your argument is that you believe making it less convenient to harass people causes people to be harassed less often, in this case by opting out of having followers

My argument is that there is no such thing as a ""casual"" internet troll. Making something a little less convenient is a negligible deterrent in the eyes of most, if not all people who are wont to stalk and harass. The second part of that argument is that the framework is already in place to replicate the follow feature in a third party tool, whether that be a browser addon, third-party website, etc., meaning that it *wouldn't even necessarily be less convenient*.

I'm not ""just playing devil's advocate"". I still stand by my claim that it would be disingenuous to allow people to ""opt out"" without also overhauling the privacy and security of the platform as a whole. They should either fix their shit the right way, or make sure everyone is aware that this is *not* a secure platform.

We are an humor community from Turkey since 2015 which impacted largely the whole Turkish social media indeed, especially in the past.  Other social media platforms has too many restrictions like Facebook, so in this summer after Facebook closed our group(s), we decided to move reddit. Approximately in 3 months, we did very well, because Turkish people very stranger to reddit although reddit is the most sixth visited website on the world, but I found reddit is proper for our extraordinary group so that we could live our freedom as we wish, and yes, this is the best for us.

We created 8 awards yet quickly, we will work on it later more.

Here's the descriptions of awards that we've made as a six pieces of set to join this event:

1) Mutfak Robotu (which means ""kitchen robot"" and this expression assigned to girls in our group as sarcastic and humorous approach, so their award will be a real kitchen robot. A kitchen robot award to kitchen robots I mean. Yeah. Lol.)

2) Dabbe Kostümü (which means ""dabbe costume"" and ""dabbe"" word comes from a first Turkish bad-made horror film. Also it has a different meaning in our sense of humor among our group, so we created such an award.)

3) Bi paket sigara (which means ""a pack of cigarettes"" some posts may be not humorous, and we have an expression I lighted a cigarette as an expression of feeling sad, so we added this award as a reward in case of such conditions.)

4) Yusuf Okur'un Beyni (which means ""brain of Yusuf Okur"" the guy, Yusuf Okur has so psychedelic brain that he makes lots of shitposts and ridicolous comments and people mostly boo him funnily. So he is a mascot for ours. So we created such an offensive but funny award.)

5) Saçma Volkan Eldiveni (which means ""Nonsense Volkan Gloves"" the guy, Volkan is the Turkish goalkeeper who plays for national team and Fenerbahce, and in our group some of our users post a serial ridicolous photos of him by ""ridicolous Volkan photo #26"" so we made a ridicolous Volkan gloves as an award)

6) Saksofon (which means ""saxophone"", you know what we mean but I'll explain tho, in our group lots of our members have a saying by ""if you do this I'll do saxo for you"" which means I will give you a blowjob, because we know we have to keep it SFW, we use an instrument as a metafor, so by this way our members will give this award those who deserves saxos which means blowjob. Ahah)

So we joijed this event on the last day. I hope it's not too late for the possibility of getting coins. We love reddit and we are growing day by day here and many Turkish people learn about and use reddit through our community. I hope we get some awards. And for you guys started such a good events (like this, like RPAN, and many more), I will give my last 500 coins to this post. Keep it good work reddit.

Reddit, Inc. is legally a *disinterested third party* to both of those arrangements, and undertaking any sort of affirmative effort on the part of Reddit, Inc. to be a clearinghouse for rights of media posted to their platform by users, it would open a Pandora's Box that Reddit doesn't want to open.

Reddit is trying to turn this into a social network. plain and simple.

These rules will be expanded, more subreddits WILL be banned. I guarantee this now. The next phase will specifically target nsfw pages, my guess is r/WatchPeopleDie and asking r/JusticeServed and r/PublicFreakout to better restrain the content specifically with fewer extreme violence, deaths, nudity. Also pornographic subreddits will go, not the more popular ones like r/gonewild but the more specific and 'extreme' ones.

I can almost guarantee that there will be autoplay videos coming, embedded adverts, and real name profiles. I wrote this in response to the facebook stuff and how reddit will be turning into facebook soon.

This is semi-relevant but this isn't so much a response to recent tragedies but rather a moving forward of eventual plans. So here's a very long comment I've been working on and isn't quite finished so skip to the end for the point.

The Socialization of Reddit

Reddit as I’m sure, or at least hope you know since this is a comment on reddit, is a website but what sort of website? Well going off of CGP Greys video from 2013 reddit was a link aggregation site with a comment section. Actually that seems and feels fairly accurate to what I considered reddit to be when I first joined and chances are you did to. So let us define it as such;

Reddit: A user controlled link aggregation site with a comments section.

It isn’t a unique concept but the implementation and utilitarian design made it pretty popular with nerds as well as benefiting from the snowball effect which meant it had enough content to keep people coming so more content kept being made so more people kept coming. So without a doubt the most important thing for reddit above all else is CONTENT. If users stopped submitting the site dies. Fast. A weekend protest of a dozen or so big subreddits is huge news and something you wake the CEO up to respond to but the blackout 2015 isn’t what this post is about.

So what is reddits business model? Well there are two main revenue streams;

Reddit gold: User can pay to have to gift reddit gold which holds with it some features

Advertising: Allowing companies to put adverts on reddit

How many BIG sites do you know that offer a gold type thing? Youtube is the biggest with ‘youtube red’ but others? As far as I’m aware Twitter, Facebook and pretty much every major site doesn’t offer this. The revenue stream is too small. It is however sold as

“Reddit Gold gives you extra features and helps keep our servers running.“

It is actively sold as a way for reddit to keep the server up. Great the users get to directly fund the operation of the site and receive benefits in return which can often be great for the user. The trouble with this is typically if the server cost grows without a userbase growth then eventually you fail to meet operational costs. So sites will often move to reduce server overhead without a loss in quality reddit has done the opposite they moved to host their own images in July 2016 and video hosting in June 2017

This will obviously cost them a ton more money to do so why do it rather than let imgur/youtube do the work? Centralization. A social media site wants to keep people on the site not just using the site but never leaving it both facebook and twitter host their own pictures and videos because they do not want to relinquish control it also allows them to place adverts (including video ones) on their site and collect more data. It is fundamental to their operation as a social network that all interaction not only goes through them but is handled by them.

On this note comes mobile applications. Most users are on phones and/or tablets so you as a social network want them using your applications. Facebook and Twitter are notoriously hostile to other applications because its a point in the network not handled by them which means they can’t monitor you even closer.

This brings us onto the reddit app situation there’s no shortage of applications for reddit most of which are excellent the trouble with them was they aren’t owned by reddit. So first you make an app I found their announcement page and couldn’t find any information on why but suffice to say the most transparent short term reason is;

•	⁠We want more advertising revenue

Now there’s nothing wrong with that. They as a site need to make money, I need to make money if that means sucking some dick so be it. The long term reason is;

*We want to have complete control from beginning to end with the interactions people make not only with content but each other.

If the reddit app gets big enough the need to support external developers goes down. Companies love control. What will happen wouldn’t be instant but rather simple

1.	⁠Features get added without informing developers so the unofficial apps are bad for short periods of time. This is a headache for developers to deal with as it often means having to work long hours and results in a worse app.
2.	⁠Poor documentation of new API’s (if there’s new ones at all) which results in a worse unofficial app
3.	⁠API’s not receiving the attention they have previously causing issues which results in a worse unofficial app
4.	⁠Eventually the announcement is made that the public API is being restricted because of the above 3 steps and how the API is now out of date, causes issues and holds back further development of reddit. Backlash is minimized because the quality of the unofficial apps have gone down.

Okay so we have our users locked into the site on the web and into our applications but that’s fucking pointless if accounts are anonymous and unlinked. What you need is a profile, an identity which allows people to post to it sort of like a personal subreddit… well what do you know we have that since March 2017

This was one of the examples used

It’s eerily similar to a twitter/facebook page is it not? A ‘personal’ I.e. real name profile will be very similar except with more information such as DOB/LOCATION/JOB and instead of active in communities you’ll see something like ‘personal pages’ or some branded terms where a user posts stuff about a holiday to Barcalena. Internally this is probably being marketed as

“Instagram but more than photos, youtube but more than videos, twitter/facebook but more than text” this pages and updates will more seamlessly integrate photos, text, video just like reddit has been doing forever and what it excels at.

Last step on this process is design. Reddit is an ugly complicated piece of shit. Small buttons, no colour. I love it, infact for me it’s TOO user friendly. But for the people they are looking to attract it needs to be SIMPLE. Real fucking simple. So first it needs to be simple to type which means markdown has to die. LaTeX isn’t the most popular document maker, markdown isn’t the most popular webtext input device. Markdown will die. This has already started. They have introduced a RTE. No one has really asked for it as markdown isn’t too complicated but still. Now onto the grander scale reddit will go through a MAJOR redesign. This will mean big pictures, icons and as little information on screen as possible. They are pretty transparent about why “Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors” they just don’t discuss the long term goals.

https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif

That’s the new reddit, it’ll have autoplaying videos, embedded advertising disguised as posts and all sorts of stuff you’ve come to expect from every single shitty social network.

This began around August 2015 and is probably a part of a four year plan to turn reddit into a full blown social network. Behind doors meeting it is being sold as;

New reddit: A life aggregation site with a comments section

So let us look at what’s been discussed in a brief overview

•	⁠Centralization; Ensuring control of reddit from beginning to end of interactions
•	⁠Profiling; Ensuring a large dataset for improved advertising revenue
•	⁠User Interface; Ensuring a site that can be accessed by everyone especially to key demographics.

Everything is in place, it’s just a case of integrating the ideas, releasing the redesign and slowly withdrawing the public API’s.

There are additional things to add but most are small points that don’t contribute much to the overall picture because they aren’t as necessary these include

1.	⁠Messaging will probably be changed to chat windows akin to facebook
2.	⁠A discord esque system or even reddit purchasing discord for VOIP and video calls.
3.	⁠A community cleanup of communities that tarnish the brand but otherwise don’t violate the rule

The [Moderator Guidelines](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines) states, in the first line,

-----------

Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for their co-collaborators.

---------------

It is **_no longer possible to assume good faith of invitees to our communities_** when there are so many subreddits and accounts on Reddit dedicated to **bad faith** interactions.

Healthy communities have healthy *boundaries*, and technology should help us set, advertise, and enforce those boundaries.

Make the ""Quarantine"" designation **_mean something useful_**, more than just ""We, Reddit, Inc. are disassociating ourselves from anything other than the bare minimum contractual duties we have to this organisation without terminating their use of Reddit"".

Make it meaningful to **users**. Give users **Quarantine karma**. Let Automoderator test against that, so that quarantined and shuttered subreddits don't undertake a diaspora every time Reddit takes action.",False,False,False,852646,117200,1368798885.0,False,True

There is certainly a bias towards quarantining subreddits that exist to produce hate speech and shocking and offensive behaviour.

> Political subreddits tend to get quarantined

T_D avoided quarantine for three years, despite promoting fascist organisations and the Unite The Right white supremacist / fascist riot that resulted in death and injury of American citizens by domestic terrorists, the organisers of which have variously been indicted or convicted of crimes stemming from that, and others of the organisers routinely issue heinous hate speech, threats, and harassment of American citizens -- some of whom have had to flee the country to save their lives.

It took **_literal proof_** that the users and moderators of T_D were conspiring to **assassinate politicians** to get it quarantined, when it should never have been allowed to reach that point.

The subreddit you've actually linked to was quarantined explicitly because the creator of the subreddit was involved in an operation to get it to be ""popular"" and then convert it into racist hate speech dedicated to a caricature of African-Americans. They thought they were being clever, but they were extremely clumsy. Find the top moderator of that subreddit and check the nature (and title, and theme) of other subreddits they created.

It wasn't quarantined ""just for the name"" -- if it had been, then one of the subreddits *I* run, which has a potentially **extremely** offensive name, would have also been quarantined.

And promised:

> We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.

And the CEO clarified:

> We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse

The system which became AOL established the Community Leader Program officially in the early 1990s, and discontinued it in 2005.  At the peak of the program, it is estimated that AOL had approximately 14,000 volunteers, including 350 non-adult teenagers.

I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist or something when I say that, but the fact is that what's ethical and what isn't depends on what your theory of ethics is based on. And mine is based on [self-ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership) and the [non-aggression principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle). I don't see how any system of ethics can put anything above that without either lacking logical consistency, or missing the point of ethics entirely.

And under my system, it's quite simple: people have a right to exchange information with each other on any topic, wouldn't you agree? If one person has some information, and voluntarily conveys that information to another person who wants to hear it, that affects nobody who doesn't want to be affected, so therefore it's okay. (What they do next is a completely separate question.) And since it's okay for them to do that, then it follows that it's okay to aid them in doing so as well. Does that make sense? You may say I'm breaking it down much more than I ought to, but it's a good way to filter out the baseless gut feelings that get in the way and make sure everything is justified with good, hard logic. It's how I think, and I personally wish more people would think in that way.

Also, are you sure you really mean ""something that is illegal"" and not ""something that is immoral""? If shoplifting were legal, I assume you wouldn't feel any differently about providing a forum for it; likewise, would you say Reddit is doing anything wrong by not banning subreddits like /r/trees and /r/LSD?

> How do you know that's not what they're using it for? They could also be using it to get access to things/places they shouldn't be. Like guns. It's a very serious security issue.

Look. Guns exist. And unless you own every single one of them as well as the only means of producing more, it's not up to you who is or isn't allowed to have them. So if guns are a major concern for you, you should plan for that. It may be easier to just count on people not having them, but if you can't accept the possibility of being wrong, then that's not a good plan. I don't mean this in an offensive or accusatory way, but to me it comes across as a bit arrogant to say someone ""shouldn't"" have a gun, just because it's easier for you or others if they don't.

Even five years ago, you would at least pretend to care about such concerns, and accuse those who believed this would create future problems of the slippery slope fallacy. But now, almost every time you make an announcement on what's tolerated on Reddit, it is further and further circumscribed. There are groups that outright grease the slippery slope, within your company and your userbase, by intentionally seeking precedents to use as justification for further ratcheting restrictions on acceptability, and nobody says anything at all meaningful against it.

- We need to be able to fully hide it (not only colapsed it) 
- You really need to work on your communication... Obviously Reddit is very touchy when it comes to changes. You can't just roll out a new feature without proper communication before. My initial reaction was to see it as another Facebook live or Instagram story and it looked stupid. But once I went on r/pan and read your marketing there I found the idea quite charming. 
- You really need to get ride of the automatic upvoting. I consider what I upvote or not as a very personnal choice and I really do not like to be forced. Maybe this an issue only for me since I don't see other users complaining about it. 

Finally to all the redditors complaining about the adds and the profit driven interest of Reddit. You need to realise that you either pay with your money or with your time and attention. If you do not want adds then pay premium. I get that a lot of users do not want to condone the admins actions by paying money to them. But you are already paying by supporting adds or by being an active users which make the platform attractive and add friendly. If most active reddit users were paying for premium you would have a real say on the way reddit is run because you would be the money makers and not some add agency who doesn't give a crap about the platform.

Reddit is obviously trying to push its financial agenda and doesn't care what the userbase wants. It only cares what the advertisers want. 

I miss the days of reddit being a low-cost, user controlled space, that didn't have a profit centered mindset but was instead focused on the sharing of useful information and creating a gathering place for people to discuss common interests. Back when it was just blue text on a white background and looked more like craigslist or wikipedia than facebook or instagram. 

We used to talk about illegal shit, or share porn, or whatever the fuck we wanted in any relevant discussion without being censored immediately. You used to be able to go to the comments section for something intelligent or informative about the relevant post, and that comment would be at the top with a few dozen or maybe a few hundred upvotes. Now the top comments are bad jokes that sound like a 6th grader thought them up, and the top posts are reposts that look like something I'd expect to find on facebook. 

This was one of the best sites on the internet, but now it's just a social media platform that's only better than facebook because of relative anonymity (although they tried to fix that by making user profiles with pictures and an ""about me"" section). If only we had somewhere else to go. It's a tragedy.

Dozens of Reddit users then posted requests for these nude photos to be shared to them by private message.[73] Other Reddit users drew attention to this discussion and the r/jailbait forum was subsequently closed by Reddit administrators on 11 October 2011

This is a sub about a notoriously expensive and to the point of being silly hobby where people contend with the physics of the universe in a vain attempt at recreating a concert hall or studio sound stage inside a living room from a recording. But I like music and well designed audio gear and it makes me happy when I got it setup right and it all sounds good when I close my eyes while sitting on the couch after a long day, so whatever. But it's seriously not a popular hobby. I live in the soon to be 3rd largest city of the USA, and there is one serious high end audio store aimed at audiophiles that isn't a Magnolia inside a Best Buy, and one physical store for well regarded used gear, and that's in the center of a large flea market. 

Anyway, so the sub has half a million subscribers and now people post very much not audiophile stuff. It's not being snobby to say that there must be a line drawn between regular audio and audiophile. There is also a sub for budget audiophile stuff, as you don't have to spend 50k on a stereo to get good sound, although, it would be easy to spend more than that. It's now less pictures and discussion of high end audio (yes, including the debates over the merits of all the silly snake oil shit like 1000 dollar cables), and more photos of vintage stuff that wasn't great when it was new, or stuff that wouldn't fly on r/budgetaudiophile because regardless of cost, it doesn't sound good. 

My point is that it doesn't make sense, the subscriber number, but whatever happened, has brought the quality of the content down. Again, it's not a money thing. If you research, you can build a respectable system on a budget. There are also suggestions for such in the stickies. People with $1000+ gaming PCs, mechanical keyboards, or console and game collections, of which there are many here, clearly have the cash to have built a decent stereo setup if they wanted. That's what I'm saying. I have an old PC and no gaming system, but my stereo is awesome.  

But if you just want to show off your love of vinyl, there are better places. 

In the world, there aren't all that many serious PC gamers, but lord are their subs toxic. 

""small"" subs are now totally not small anymore. Many subs like this exist, subs that *should* be small but aren't, and the reddit experience is dying because of it. I'm sure there is controversy brewing in r/knitting but then I wouldn't know because I don't knit. But they have 300k subs, so I have no doubt.

I remember when r/makeupaddiction wasn't, well, like it is now. It once was a place where people passionate about makeup could discuss it, and not a weird version of r/rateme

Reddit doesn't want to fix these things. They ban one and quarantine another leftist meme sub, though. Reddit often being the target of the memes, hmm.

People will eventually find a better place to talk about makeup, knitting, and hifi audio, but also sports, current events, and politics.

It was when they banned the replacements for those subs, a year after Voat launched, that they moved en masse to Voat.

Prior to that Voat had been gaining a certain amount of steam from people who weren't happy with the direction the Admins were taking the site -- the current move towards something more like Facebook was already starting at the time. There were several sites that popped up to try to be the Reddit to Reddit's Digg, and Voat was the one that seemed most likely to pull it off until reddit banned Fat People Hate and Coontown and all of their users moved over at once.

Anyway, Tildes seems to be in a similar place to where Voat was early on, but with some additional thought put in to fixing some of the problems brought in by Reddit's voting system.

I pursued my education with that mindset.  Friends got comms degrees they slept through, left after four drunken years, got good jobs.  I don't blame them, but I wanted to chase my passion and my gift, and did so.  I don't regret the choice.

I didn't end up spending all that much either, which helps.  Graduate school was covered by scholarships (which actually let me go, as I would have had to end after undergraduate otherwise), and my undergrad was completed debt free.  I worked all the way through, and my mother, a public school teacher, had saved up for my whole life so she could pay for my brother and I to go to a small state college.

That actually still makes me smile, because the rich kids down the street would always make fun of us for being poorer and not going on vacations.  Well their rich parents didn't care enough to save for college, so those rich kids now have debt while the poor kid with the teacher mom doesn't.  

Suprising how common that was in my area.  Classmates dads were lawyers and doctors, my dad was a pizza boy.  But since their dads bought boats and they chose to go to private city colleges, all that wealth didn't help their debt on iota. 😂

Edit: some rich kid who thinks his debt should be forgiven cuz his dad bought a boat is pretty upset lol",False,False,1566339093.0,53117,6102,1563218587.0,False,False

The only thing I resent is expertise in history is wholly disrespected.  My brother got his degree in programming.  When people talk about computers and he speaks, they view him as an expert.  When my friend the mechanic speaks about car trouble, people view him as an expert.

When I speak about Islamic Terrorism, which I've studied for literal years and written hundreds of pages on, people think their own opinions are equally valid.  That's the curse of historical study.

These promises have been broken:

Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse",False,False,False,92656,122242,1493831763.0,False,True
