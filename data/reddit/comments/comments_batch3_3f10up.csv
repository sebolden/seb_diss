We're hivemind: the website. Everyone bands together in a massive orgy of approval or disapproval, and is more than willing to spread this out as they so called ""leak"" or share same-site links.

This is nice, but to me the worst brigading isn't coordinated attacks. It's meta subreddits that link to other subreddits. Subreddit Drama is the most obvious culprit, though the mods over there at least do the best they can to prevent it.

Places like /r/badlinguistics (which is just an utter cesspool) do *nothing* to prevent or discourage their users from brigading, and honestly I think that sort of behaviour needs to be removed. Either by getting rid of the whole offending subreddit, or at least banning the specific users from there who vote or comment in linked threads.

Okay... I'm not sure why we need a new one or why the consolidation needs to happen.  Or why you didn't explain it to us.  So, that's puzzling.

I don't see how.  Improved how?  What kind of bans?  And shadowbanning isn't just 'sneaky' it's fucking draconian.  And so is not explaining to us what the hell you mean by this.

> improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible)

This has been talked about for awhile and the only reason it's not in place is because anybody tenacious enough to create a new account to shitpost with is also tenacious enough to change their IP.  I don't understand how this is going to change anything.  Seems like a lot of effort for minimal impact.

Research?  Techniques?  There's no technique to brigading.  It just happens.  And you wouldn't be concerned about it in the least if it didn't have that shitty label attached to it.

A small % troll because there are no repercussions.  You could change that.

Keep track of and map banned users to IP addresses (nodes) and email addresses.  

While a user can change his address, it cannot be done very many times.

If a single node has 5 banned users, then it is possibly a troll, you could confirm by looking at the content.

If a node has 50, then block the address and maybe notify the net-admin (whois) that ""127.0.0.2 has been blacklisted from reddit for xxx.""

If my employees of my children get me blacklisted on reddit, there will be a reckoning.

It should be a timed blacklist, maybe 60 days?  I could probably whip out a lamp/iptables web app for reddit admins (not sub admins)

Better yet, banned addresses will go to a landing page that explains the ban and offers an appeal process. ( The parents may finally have to step up.)

The reason FatPeopleHate was banned wasn't because of it's message, but how it harassed others, and made it easy for others to do the same. It's like the cake makers in Oregon that refused service to the gay couple. They got sued, but not for their refusal. They got sued for sharing the couple's personal information with everyone, who then harassed the gay couple for months afterwards with death threats and the like.

this probably shouldn't have been added to your post. I get that you're trying to make a joke, but it's very clearly going to appear as tone-deaf and dismissive of your users, and there was no value added to your post by putting it there.

EDIT to add: what I mean to say in short is ""it's best to assume that not everyone will get the joke"".

these sorts of seemingly small missteps are exactly the sorts of things that make the community feel disconnected from and looked down upon / devalued by the admins.

it's likely that you don't mean it to come off that way, but something I see the reddit admins need improvement on a lot is understanding the difference between ""how I mean it"" and ""how it's likely to be interpreted, especially by millions of people, and ESPECIALLY by people with X and Y cognitive biases because of how they already feel generally""...

In my office, our CS team has a concept of Public and Private comments on issues. All comments on all issues are considered private and not exposed to the clients. 

When a comment is deemed of value (or, at least, far enough along that it's not something we're afraid of showing), the comment is marked Public. It's then picked up automatically and shuffled into the status reporting system. 

From our perspective, everything you do is valuable. If I had my druthers, I would love to be able to just sift through your JIRA to see what's actively being worked on, what issues have come up... what the devs actually think about any given issue. 

I recognize that this is not good business. If you show people how the sausage is made, it opens you up to a whole assortment of disasters. 

However, if you could come up with a system wherein certain comments are marked as interesting and valuable, and then have an automated process for posting these to a dedicated sub, you could demonstrate to the userbase the stuff you're working on without having to create a post and then stick around to answer comments (lest you are accused of hit-and-run). 

Granted, this would require some trust on your part. No amount of 'safe harbor' statements will prevent some people from holding you to the letter of a statement. 

And you really couldn't remove posts from this system without suffering accusations of trying to hide things. 

You'd also have to train the devs and cms to correctly identify comments worth sharing. The comments would have to exist a-contextually (since we don't have access to your issue tracking system), and would have to be careful not to reveal privileged information. 

If the system required a vetting process that was too complex or time consuming, then that is all you would do and it wouldn't be worth it. It has to be almost totally automated. 

If you could resolve these complications, I think it would be a great way to share with the community. It could even serve as a crowd sourcing platform for trying to come up with ideas to solve specific complications. 

It might be more work than it's worth. I'll just say as a user and a professional dev, I prefer too much communication to too little. ",False,False,False,329159,392,1199155376.0,False,True

I kind of love this idea. Like a /r/beta but for the new content policy and community policing policies. Maybe only let it be open to mods.

I see it as sort of a public hearing. Instead of announcing every little change on /r/announcements, you put them up in, let's say, /r/contentpolicybeta or /r/reddittownhall or something similar. Only policies and features that are basically ready for print would go up, but you allow the community to comment on them and then you see if you want to work any of the community ideas into the final version before going public with it on /r/announcements.

It seems ridiculous to me.

The entire idea that brigading is negative and has to be mitigated relies on the assumption that everybody on reddit lacks the ability to form their own opinions and conclusions on a topic, and that's pretty insulting. Instead of banning and punishing brigading, people should be punished or have their posts deleted for, you know, actually making bad/hostile posts, regardless of where the user found the topic they are replying to. 

For instance, about 30 mins ago, I found out about something I find super interesting that I have something to say about on, let's call it subbreddit Y. However, since I found it via Subreddit X and made a comment in the thread that linked to subreddit Y, I can't pot in subreddit Y without risking an immediate ban even if I am posting the same thing I would have had I found about subreddit Y on my own, without subreddit X. The best I can do is message the moderators of subbreddit Y beforehand and hope that they message me back and give me instructions on how not to cross the line, if that's not impossible.

It's natural that people will find stuff they find interesting via links and want to be involved, and there's nothing wrong with that inherently.

* If someone votes or comments in a thread linked from SRD (i.e. their browser referrer link is from SRD), the SRD mods get a notification. I know the admins can check this stuff, so there's got to be a way to make it possible.
* If an SRD mod bans a user, that user can no longer click on linked threads in SRD. The link simply doesn't work unless they log out, at which point they can't vote or comment. It would be even better if SRD links simply didn't appear on /r/all for banned users, period.
* If a banned user opens up the SRD main page, they only see a ""YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED"" message. If they create a new account to see what's in SRD, that's ban evasion which is already against the rules.

However, you decide to go around telling all of our friends that I think ketchup is the best. You write angry op-eds into the newspaper about how I should be burned at the stake.

Just badges of honor for the 3Edgy5Me crowd.  Since most of the traffic will be directly linked from other similarly hive-minded communities, none of it matters anyway.

Everyone is yelling ""because ads"" but I don't think that's true. I would guess that the reason they're building it themselves is so they can provide the same experience as the iOS app. They can also make sure that users are getting the experience they're intended to be getting.

Here's why:

In one scenario a user new to Reddit might go to the Android Play store, search Reddit, and download some really poorly implemented app (that has ads on it, so really it's the same shit everyone is complaining about) that really breaks the Reddit experience. Now that user will associate this shitty app with Reddit, and potentially stop using Reddit because of it.

In an even worse scenario a popular app could be used to implement vote-brigading or hi-jack very popular sub-reddits. If I'm a developer and I get angry because Reddit just fired one of my favorite employees, I could push an update to my app that just makes all users of it automatically down vote anything a reddit employee says. I could use it to see if a user is a moderator of a popular sub-reddit and then shut it down.

There are a lot of reasons as to why you would build it internally.",False,False,False,9449,1010,1319330936.0,False,False

This attitude largely spawned from the treatment the men's rights movement gets from feminism. Look up the videos that came out from the attempted men's rights conference in Toronto. They were gathering to discuss what can be done to lower the higher rate of suicide among young adult males.

The result was a group of feminists stormed the area with megaphones shouting ""we don't care what you have to say"" until the conference was disbanded, and nothing was accomplished or discussed. This group of feminists was painted as ""the good guys"" for fighting misogyny by the media. 

This is the kind of shit the men's right movement deals with, so it makes sense that they can get bitter sometimes.

Edit: Also, when they show up elsewhere with this attitude, it's usually to refute false facts being presented as part of feminist arguments (which are typically being used to attempt to marginalize/demonize men). This gets called misogyny, of course. Also, the men's rights movement is about gender equality, and it just so happens that the areas in society/law where men are treated worse than women tend to be a result of feminist-led policies.",False,False,1438261275.0,111327,230,1346894165.0,False,False

/u/spez was right on earlier when he said that silencing the opposition is no way to win an argument.

There are some topics that seem so taboo that respectable people refuse to discuss them. /r/CoonTown is rather the poster-child for this. I'll not defend them.

But I will defend the people who discuss other taboo topics, like polygamy or even those that argue against certain aspects of the established Age of Consent laws. (These topics are becoming less taboo and more taboo over time. So, incidentally, did racism, though I'd like to think we're living on the right side of this historical discussion.)

I see no effective way to eliminate some taboo topics without eliminating the others. I believe /u/spez believes likewise. His solution, and I think it's a good one, is to quarantine these communities so that it is clear that Reddit, Inc. does not endorse their views. (Although if you believe Reddit, Inc. endorses even 0.1% of what redditors post, you're probably pretty offended by Reddit, Inc.) It keeps the taboo topics separated so that they don't show up for the vast majority of users, which is good. Those users probably expect not to be subjected to those taboo topics.

And lastly, neither the decision to ban nor not to ban would be clearly and unambiguously right or wrong. There's no phoney hand-wringing or cynical moralizing here.

Some people aren't worth wasting your breath on, but they're easy to spot, downvote, and ignore.

The answer is that it requires proof originating from a legal process: either a court decision for that particular media, or law enforcement representing to reddit that criminal copyright violation is occurring, or a DMCA takedown process (which largely does not apply to reddit, as they largely do not host most content that might be DMCAd (unless it's text, or is a graphic element served as part of CSS)).

Further, in this age of *licenses*, it's possible that whoever is posting links to outside-hosted material has been granted a license allowing them to host that material and link to it — and that license may be granted explicitly through license language, unwittingly through license language, or implicitly through case law and legislation of the applicable jurisdictions from where it was distributed and where it is hosted. Those are all legal technicalities which reddit doesn't control, and which reddit is unqualified to interpret or enforce — that would be a court's job, and reddit is technically an ""*uninterested third party*"".

Without the legal process, anyone could ""claim"" they had copyright interest in something and use that to censor discussion and chill public participation. For reddit, or any forum host, to *reasonably know* that the copyright is actually being violated, they need the legal process followed.

When reddit *has* been informed that a community existed solely for the purpose of criminal copyright infringement, they shut the community and its offshoots down — the visble example being /r/thefappening, which was shut down once reddit administration was approached by law enforcement investigating the theft of the pictures.

First off... Happy cake day!

Secondly, yeah. That's seriously fucked up, and thank you for sharing that page. It's an eye opener to those that didn't know that this is happening on *every* form of social media. Hate groups actively recruit members, and the internet is the perfect recruitment tool for them. Any avenue where you can anonymously, subtly, and subconsciously shape the opinions of others is going to be utilized by all sorts of groups, from the KKK, to ISIS, to corporate advertising and PR firms, to JTRIG. They're all out there, and they're all active, and it's important to be aware of it. 

In one of my other comments here I mention that the world is not a ""safe space"". It's not. It's a fucked up world with an intolerable amount of completely unreasonable racism and bigotry, a lot of misplaced anger and unwarranted misconceptions brought on by... ya know, I don't have the slightest clue where it comes from. Miseducation? Lack of compassion? I don't have that answer.
 
But the question at hand is how much of a ""nanny-state"" we're willing to accept on the internet. How deep do we want our censorship to pervade, and who do we trust to make those decisions for us? Even if we wish to put our personal security into the hands of those running the show (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Google, the comment sections on other websites) instead of taking it onto ourselves, can they even do the job effectively?

Personally, I don't think the corporations should be tasked with policing the internet. I don't trust them to decide what should and shouldn't be said, and I don't think they're equipped to stop the onslaught of manipulation that will indefinitely occur across the web. In order for the internet to remain a place where we can have a free and open discourse, we will all need to garner a stronger sense of personal responsibility for our actions. This opt-in proposal seems like a fair and balanced way to appease both sides, and I'm all for giving it a shot, and seeing what the results are. If successful, perhaps some version of it can be implemented across other sites, as well.

I see the internet as the bastion of free speech, and that means accepting that there will be speech I don't want to be exposed to. Like a racist guy screaming out hate speech on the corner of a city block, I ignore it and move on. I'm sympathetic to those that wish to not be exposed to it in the first place, but on social media platforms, it ultimately comes down to personal choice. Ignore it. Teach your kids to ignore it. Outweigh the hate with positive messages. The internet isn't a utopia. It's a reflection of society, all of the good, and all of the bad. If we want a better internet, well...

Or, and I'm not trying to be a dick about it, but this is just a thought...

Some people will just be cognizant of the fact that they might see things that offend them, and knowing those risks, will choose to witness a broader scope of humanity in an attempt to understand the plethora of opinions and viewpoints out there.

For example, I'm vehemently opposed to Fox News, but I still ""opt-in"" to watch it on occasion in an attempt to better understand how they arrive at their viewpoints. It's enlightening to listen in on that echo-chamber, even for an hour or two. You really can grasp a better understanding of how they operate, and how their spinning of the facts must affect their viewers.

I'm vehemently opposed to most of the content on the subs that will most likely fall under this ""quarantine"", but I'll opt-in to see that, too. It is a side of humanity that does exist, however repulsive it may be. Pushing it off into the shadows and pretending it isn't happening just because I might be offended leaves me less informed and narrows my view of the world. 

Not everyone who will opt-in to see quarantined content is making shitty life choices. Hell, not everyone who opts-in is doing so to participate in those subs. One could argue that accepting the blinders placed on you by other people (in this case, reddit admins) is a shitty choice to make, as well. Personally, I am responsible enough to decide for myself what I do and do not want to be exposed to.

The world isn't a ""Safe Space"". There is shit out there that is harmful and destructive, and I run the risk of being exposed to that just by living. I don't need a nanny, and I don't need trigger warnings. However, I understand that some people do. I truly do sympathize with those people, and I'd like Reddit to be a place where those people can feel comfortable, as well. I think this opt-in is a great idea, not to punish those who wish to express opinions that I'm vehemently opposed to, but as an option for those who will choose, for whatever reason, to *not* opt-in. 

Just my two cents.

First off, as myself and several others have already mentioned, RES has features that let you maintain an ignore list so there's already a way to do this, just not with default Reddit unless you get a lot of PMs or want to do some weird Javascript hacking.

Second, Reddit already self-selects for group-think. That's what subreddits and upvotes do. People group into like minded communities and posting opinions popular with the group is encouraged through upvotes. Even if the votes fail to discourage behavior they do serve to hide it thanks to the comment sorting and hide thresholds.

Besides, blocking a user is per-account, so if someone makes a habit of posting controversial things on large subreddits they'll have to block most of the site's active participants to stop seeing contradictory views.

Lastly, as an active participant in the corners of Reddit generally labeled as ""perpetually offended"" I don't know anyone who actually does this. Plenty of people I know have tag lists thousands of users long so they know who posts on asshole subs or has been an ass to them in the past, but anyone who really and truly doesn't want to see contradicting opinions doesn't post anything on Reddit.

Let's pretend there was an ""argument,"" and your intention was to foster this argument with the good intentions of potentially converting virulent racists to not be racist anymore.

Where is this argument taking place?  Not on coontown, that's for sure.  A sub entirely dedicated to posting about how awful black people are is the lions den for any brave souls wishing to spread a bit of truth around.  Plus, it's privately maintained; they can ""silence opposition"" themselves.

Where it will take place is the rest of reddit, with comments calling black people theives when there is a picture of something that is black, or endless ""dindu nuffin"" quotes on endless posts about somebody black doing anything.  Hosting a subreddit for racism means *racists will create accounts*, and creating an account makes it more likely for someone to comment on the rest of Reddit.

To me it seems, the longer these 'wars' go on, the more extremes they attract and the more rational people they chase away from their group, until you have two extreme groups that no longer represent the original ideas.

We analyzed his GPS data and found that he had to try and get back to land, but was completely lost.

For proof, you need look no further than the dozens of angry responses to my previous comment, many of which are saying exactly the same thing. Is having dozens of people shrieking the same thing past each other a productive way of having a discussion? No it is not. Is it worth my time to go through and patiently explain to every single one of those people why they're wrong and I'm right? Hit the same basic points over and over because everyone needs their hand held along the same path? 

It's like I'm cutting fifteen different trails into the woods at once. Why don't I just cut one trail, and then everyone can use it? If they show up late to the trail, let's put a sign up saying ""Here is the trail! Here's what we've already done!"" rather than going and cutting a new trail?

>It's new for every new person who has that conversation, and for them, it's worthwhile.

Great. I have absolutely no objection to people being exposed to new ideas! The thing is, though, that **all these conversations** have been had **hundreds of times already.** We're not *advancing* the debate, we're *duplicating* the debate by starting off at the first floor every single time.

This is known as ""derailing"" and it happens all. the. fucking. time on this site. Just look at any post (or subreddit) which even *hints* at supporting feminism.

If people were **actually interested** in having an honest intellectual discussion, debate, or argument, you would think they would expose themselves to the available material on the subject, including literally thousands of previous ""debates"" on the subject, before opening their mouths and adding their uninformed takes. 

This doesn't happen, obviously, which tells me something about how concerned people are about ""learning about issues.""

But really, most of my point here is that I don't think tolerating ""hate"" subreddits has a thin sliver of anything to do with ""advancing the conversation."" I think that's a bullshit reason, and it doesn't justify keeping them around. Keep them around if you want, or justify it some other way, but ""Coontown needs to be here because we as a society need to have a conversation"" doesn't hold any water either. Because, yeah, we've *had conversations.* We're having *the same conversations* over and over again because people don't read the previous conversations. How is this productive? It isn't.

""Hey, maybe gay people *are* ruining the world and should be killed. We need to have that conversation!"" Uh, no, we're kind of past that point even though this is a ""valid opinion"" so we're not gonna start the conversation there.

""Niggers are subhuman!"" Well, now *hold on*, let's hear him out! Let's have the conversation! It's like, no, we're not gonna use that as a starting point. Let's pick it up a little bit past that phase.

Which means it's a bullshit reason for keeping them around.

You're assuming that it's equally possible for an arbitrary person to stumble into coontown and agree with something as it is for them to privately reach out to somebody else who they saw make a racist comment and organize in private.  I think it is far less likely that somebody who sits on the fence with borderline racist thoughts will actively seek out somebody in private if they don't find an already established public community.

You're also assuming that for every one ""fence sitter"" you can dissuade from their racist views, another will become full on racist.  I think the people organizing there are not ""beginning to think racist thoughts.""  They're already there, and all the way.  You're not going to ""fact and logic"" them into submission.  Ever try to beat a dumbass by using logic?  They always walk away thinking they won.  If you don't allow them that public forum, you largely isolate them from each other and take away a lot of the ability they have to recruit and further radicalize less extreme thinkers.  Their comments in isolation within a regular sub will get absolutely demolished, and, if nothing else, can be used as a head on a pike.  They won't have the sense of security that comes with knowing they're surrounded by a community of like minds and will feel less bold about broadcasting their shitty views.

---

George is a young professional and enjoys redditting during breaks (or at least, that's what he'll admit to the boss). He has a dozen or so subreddits that he follows, including /r/bestof, /r/ShitRedditSays , and /r/TumblrInAction.

One morning, a cross-reddit link is posted in the latter forum lampooning some exceptionally naïve SJWing elsewhere on reddit. (Sure, the link probably violates TIAs rules, but it was early and the mods weren't fully caffinated yet and missed it.) George laughs at the obvious troll and reflexively downvotes. He then heads to /r/bestof to see what's new there.

About an hour later (maybe less), George gets a PM. “Odd,” George thinks, “I don't usually get PMs.” He opens it to read this:

> George, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/TumblrInAction on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. This is your first warning, which will expire after a month of good behaviour.

“Oh, dear,” George thinks, “I didn't realize that was brigading. I'll make sure not to vote like that in the future.”

Three weeks later, George upvotes a thread linked from /r/bestof. It was early and, this time, it was he that hadn't had his coffee. He gets another message:

> George, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/bestof on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. This is your second warning, which will expire after a month of good behaviour. Unfortunately, because of your repeated brigading, you may no longer vote on content until you have fewer than two warnings active. Please read our <link>Reddit Warnings FAQ</link>.

George is normally a level-headed guy, but this time, he loses his cool. He creates a new account and heads over to that same link and downvotes it another time, just for good measure. He then receives the following PM:

> GeorgeAlt, you participated in a vote brigade from /r/bestof on this comment: <link />. Vote brigades are against reddit policy, which you can read <link>here</link>. Records show that you are an alternate account of George, which means you share the two warnings you already have. Both GeorgeAlt and George are now banned from reddit for the next month, at which time, both accounts will drop back to two warnings. Please be aware that creating additional accounts to circumvent this ban will result in permanent bans as well as possibly other administrative action. <more links to rules and faqs>

---

The key takeaway here is that George's punishments were proportional to his crimes, and, at first, aimed at educating him in correct behaviour. Also, his minor errors expire fairly quickly, but continued errors over time will build up. And the system automatically prevented him from getting himself in extra trouble without his working around it. (You can't brigade if you can't vote. Also note: if you can't vote, you are at an automatic disadvantage commenting, since your comment starts at 0 instead of 1.) Critically, all this happened without mod or admin intervention, which is the only way it can possibly work.

After a certain age and number of upvotes to prove their worth, the user can be upgraded to a ""standard"" user with 1 default upvote and additional abilities as decided by each subreddit's mods.

False.  Shadowbanning wasn't ever meant to be used on USERS.  It was only ever originally intended to be used against BOTS.  Spam bots, to be specific.  And now they (the bots), like most any half-way savey user, can easily tell if they're shadowbanned or not (log out, go to your userpage... can you see  it?  No? Then you're shadowbanned) 

And so now:  shadowbans are mostly used against regular users, which was never the intention, and is incredibly cruel to those who aren't savvy enough to tell that they have been shadowbanned (even though its trivially easy) since they could potentially go on wastring their time using their account, not knowing that nobody can see what they're doing.   Thats fine if you're a bot, cruel if you're a human.   They are obsolete for so many reasons, and are just plain cruel to users who may or may not have done something that bad.

I had my account shaddowbanned once, because another account from the same IP (My girlfriend) upvoted a lot of my comments once...  Because she was supporting me in an argumet..  The system thought I was ""vote manipulating"" and shadowbanned me... I had no idea for days, wasted tons of time figuring out what was going on, and eventually had an Admin un-shadowban me and tell me ""yea sorry.. this actually happens a lot with people who live together, and do things together on reddit, you didn't actually break any rules, it was just an unfortunate accident"".  HAPPENS, ALL, THE TIME... its bullshit, and unless you know enough to check whether or not you are shadowbanned like me, you might just be fucked... because you'd never know you were banned, for all the wrong reasons too.

I disagree.

Subs like coontown shouldn't have a place on reddit.  There posts already rarely move up in /r/all, however many times users from that sub will crosspost misleading pictures or TILs to other subs and be highly upvoted with their race-baiting.  

Reddit is hosting the fastest growing white supremacist community and giving them a platform to spread their ideas on one of the largest subreddits.  Their ideas and memes are now being spread from those quarantine subs to others because they ate being given a platform here.

Yes, there's a hypothetical slippery slope. I don't think that banning Coontown and friends means that the site is slipping down it though. Sure, the line isn't always clear, but sometimes it is, and subreddits about hating black people or encouraging rape or posting pictures of dead children can all get deleted from this site and no value will be lost. Quite the opposite. 

No one is proposing to ban any subreddit that someone's offended by. And the lack of clarity isn't necessarily a problem. It's a site run by human beings who can exercise rational judgement, and when they mess up the community is sure to let them know, and they can fix it. Or we all vote with our ad-viewing eyeballs and leave the site entirely if they screw up too badly. It sure sounds like they really hold free speech in high regard, so I don't think that the ban hammer will get out of control. 

>Don't misunderstand me here, I'm not a coontown subscriber, and I find the place abhorrent personally, 

Literally *everyone* says that except the subscribers themselves, including the people who actually run reddit. That leads to...

>We don't lose anything by allowing hateful people to whine at each other in their own little circles

We do lose something. This site that we like is already tainted by its association with shitty communities. Redditors and the site as a whole don't have a good reputation, and it's thanks to a small, toxic minority. The staff are bending over backward spending time building ""quarantine"" systems to try and keep the toxicity contained and invisible, anything to avoid actually getting rid of it. Part of our ad dollars and gold go toward giving terrible, outdated, hateful, disgusting ideas a nice popular platform to spread their shit for free. And what we get in return is some pointless idealism about free speech. It's pointless not because I hate free speech and love censorship and want to silence anyone who I dislike, it's pointless because we've already got the internet as a free speech platform and it's better at free speech than reddit will ever be. Anyone can make their own site, put whatever they want on it, and not have to worry about someone shutting them down, short of it being actually illegal. You don't get that kind of freedom on reddit, just ask the jailbait people. ""It's not technically illegal"" was practically their motto. So, if we can't have the benefits of a free speech utopia anyway, why should we put up with all the drawbacks? Ban the worst of the worst, keep an eye on the borderline cases, and reddit will be a better place, meanwhile the free exchange of ideas will continue just fine.

""Improve"" is quite subjective, but people formulating ideas of the superiority of one race over another have had a massive impact on human history.

False. Many SJW liberal types enter Coontown with questions or concerns. We're well equipped with facts and information provided from scientific journals and government**s** to backup our views.

What if reddit had existed then? What if reddit had banned subreddits devoted to those issues just because some people did not agree with them? Even quarantining them diminishes their influence which is something we would all be horrified if it happened to /r/lgbt today. Yet you aren't willing to be satisfied with that. You want to end the discussion. Your argument being that common sense or common knowledge or whatever else has determined the outcome of the discussion and therefore this foregone conclusion makes the discussion moot is a weak one. Unless you can predict the future you don't really know what may happen.

Let's take something a little more unsettled than the humanity of black people though and apply your reasoning. 

Abortion. One of the most divisive issues of the last several generations. People on the side of women's rights tend to feel absolutely that it is a woman's right to choose. People on the side of right to life organizations feel so strongly that life is sacred that they have (somewhat ironically) murdered people who perform abortions and routinely commit crimes in acts of civil disobedience.

While we all know that reddit administration would never come down on either side of an argument so divisive lets speculate. They are after all using their own moral compass to decide what subreddits need to be banned, quarantined or promoted as valued members of the site. So lets say that the administration feels very strongly that abortion should always be illegal except in the case of serious health risks to the mother. They find the very idea of ending life in the womb abhorrent and proclaim that it is not a women's rights issue but rather a moral issue of good and evil.

In consideration of the fact that women's right groups advocating for a woman's right to choose are not breaking the site rules or the law they instead quarantine any subreddits on the issue.

Do you see now how this could go? It isn't a matter of whether or not the discussion has value to you. It doesn't matter of you feel the matter is settled or the discussion moot. You are taking that discussion, whatever it may be, and proclaiming it worthless and silencing it.

Certainly users slip through, but the goal of these subs is not to brigade or promote a certain view.

On the other hand, tweets promoting an AMA are mmk, because bringing users to a thing in which they are asked to participate is cool.  However, promoting specific posts and asking that followers vote would not.

So for example, onsite brigading by subs that promote certain views, whether they be a link posted into SRS or KiA where users are invited to express there opinions is a problem, but bestof as a subreddit isn't, because while is shines a light on a posts or set of posts, its not actively encouraging users to cause trouble, and SRD is even less of an issue because they actively ban pissers.

tl;dr most of this is garbage that you probably shouldn't read.

I personally disagree. I don't think hate speech should be protected speech. I think that the freedom **from** harassment and hatred is more important than the freedom **to** harass and hate. While discussion of idealogies is important, there's no place for racism moving forward in the world.

~~I think there's still an issue here about this list that you've linked though. You still seem to be attributing the generation of that list to reddit. **It is categorically not something that any reddit employee has generated.** You are not on a ""reddit list of problem users"". This is a user (likely a moderator) who has created a list to identify users that they deem problematic.~~

~~You can tell that this is not an administrator / official reddit list, because it is a json list used to populate tags that are used in Reddit Enhancement Suite.~~

~~Reddit Enhancement Suite is **absolutely not** something that is supported by reddit, and the official stance is that all administrators **cannot** use Reddit Enhancement Suite for anything, because it interferes with normal use of the site.~~

~~So your concern about this list is entirely misplaced. There is **no** list made by administrators that places you on a watchlist along with CoonTown.~~

As the rest of my comment shows, I absolutely agree with this 100%. As long as the speech isn't threatening, harassing, or inciting illegal activity, game on. However, if I'm at a friend's house and someone is outside screaming racial slurs, my friend has a right to keep his windows shut if either he or I don't want to hear it.

That's how I view this opt-in button. My friend Reddit, who owns the house, is saying, ""I can open the windows, but just to let you know, there's a guy screaming some pretty awful stuff out there"". Now, I'm the kind of guy who is gonna say ""just open it. I can take it, or ignore it, and it seems a bit stuffy in here without the windows open"", but I can see why some people would rather not endure it.

When a mod is added, he cannot make any changes to any mods that were added before him.  Here's a scenario

1. You make a subreddit and foster a community.
2. You bring on five more mods to help you out because they're awesome.
3. You get shadowbanned for who-knows-why.
4. You make a new account and get one of the mods to add your new account as a mod.
5. This new account no longer has the ability to make changes to the rights of the other mods.  They are now all _above_ you.  If any of them start acting out as a mod, you can no longer remove them to stop their abuse. 

> Are there actually people who care about their account?

Given how many people are upset about being mistakenly (or appropriately) shadowbanned, the answer is a resounding yes.

Edit:  so this is clearly an unpopular thought. I've distilled it into a single sentence that includes  very divisive word.  I standby what I've said, so I feel like I had better flesh out my idea for clarity.

Shadowbans exist for the sole purpose of quietly separating a nuisance from the rest of community.  Not to enforce Reddit's rules.  The community agrees when they use the site that the rules ought to be enforced, users are banned when they break site rules.  Shadowbanning is unnecessary when a banning is administered because site rules have been broken.  

 Shadowbans are convenient for admin because they allow them to enforce unwritten rules.  When a user is acting within the posted site rules, but breaking unwritten rules they are quietly quarantined to a site experience of conversing with only themselves.  Nobody hears their voice, yet they are made to feel as though they still have one. 

 /u/spez has clearly stated the new quarantine option is for subreddits that are not breaking site rules.   

Users interact in subreddits, if subreddits interact anywhere on reddit, it is on /r/all, where posts and subreddits gain attention from the general user base.  If you remove a subreddit from /r/all you effectively remove its voice from being heard from the rest of reddit.  If this is done, not because the sub is breaking the rules as they are written, but because they are breaking the unwritten rules.  Because, they are a nuisance to the admin.  Then the sub is effectively free to interact only with itself.  Just as though it has been shadowbanned.

The only line that matters is the one you cross once you decide to start censoring ideas. You either allow people to share ideas no matter what they are because you believe in that ideal or you start to censor things you don't like. By the time you start talking about which things you should censor you've already lost what makes reddit great. 

> We do lose something. This site that we like is already tainted by its association with shitty communities. Redditors and the site as a whole don't have a good reputation, and it's thanks to a small, toxic minority

I don't feel that way. There are lots of distasteful things to be found on reddit and lots of wonderful things too. That's because right now reddit is a mirror that reflects humanity. The good and the bad. If people have a problem with something someone says on Reddit they are misguided if they try to blame Reddit for that person's opinions, and they are fooling themselves if they think that removing those ideas from reddit will make them go away. 

>  Part of our ad dollars and gold go toward giving terrible, outdated, hateful, disgusting ideas a nice popular platform to spread their shit for free.

Those distasteful corners of the website are a litmus test for the freedom of Reddit's users. When you buy gold you aren't supporting the opinions of people in coontown any more than you are supporting the ideas of the people in /r/science. You are supporting the idea that people should be able to come together and discuss whatever they want freely. 

> it's pointless because we've already got the internet as a free speech platform and it's better at free speech than reddit will ever be. Anyone can make their own site, put whatever they want on it, and not have to worry about someone shutting them down, short of it being actually illegal.

Someone did that already. They called that website Reddit. It's worked out pretty well so far. It's not been perfect, but Reddit has still managed to keep working toward the ideal that people should be able to talk about whatever they want. 

> Ban the worst of the worst, keep an eye on the borderline cases, and reddit will be a better place, meanwhile the free exchange of ideas will continue just fine. 

""The worst of the worst"" according to what? ""Borderline cases"" according to what? The ""free exchange of ideas"" limited to a subset of approved ideas is not a free exchange of ideas at all.

Or ignoring FPH and related subs and keep eating yourself to death, it's a free country. You get to be fat, everyone else gets to dislike you  for it.

I take the sometimes unpopular stance that *shame is not always a bad thing*. 

Yeah, FPH was often just plain mean, but killing that sub seems to have set a dangerous precedent for Reddit. Don't like what people say? That's fine. But - particularly on the internet - trying to silence discussion is essentially taking a baseball bat to a gigantic beehive and angering ALL the bees because a few of them got annoying. 

As someone surrounded by paranoid conservatives, nothing - and I mean *nothing* will reinforce their delusional conspiracy theories in their heads than trying to shut them up. 

Let 'em talk. That's right, Obama's a fascist space alien from the planet Jihad. Yup, Ted Nugent is a genius. Fluoride is a mind control agent. Sure!  Keep it coming! Let 'em rant. And then point, laugh, and shame them. It pisses them off, but after a while, no one takes them seriously because *their own words* become shrill and hilarious. Their message got out. Their message was dumb, and often easily shredded to bits by a little research and verifiable *facts*. (God, they hate facts). Now the only people nodding along are the dittoheads. 

But if you were to somehow shut down /r/conservative - or wonder of wonders - take Fox ""News"" off the air - you've just made the problem FAR worse. Now they feel totally justified, they feel they're right, and everyone really *was* out to get them, and their message *must* be the truth because they're being silenced. 

And honestly, the Onion's job is hard enough. Don't starve them of material.

Put another way: I saw a video here of a Klan rally recently. The Klan was allowed to walk around with their stupid rebel flags and their goofy sheets and generally be rednecks. No one stopped their little parade, and no one should even try. ...Instead, a gentleman with a tuba stood just outside the parade and quietly played goofy, cartoony 'wump, dump, wumm wammp' sound effects, lending the entire proceeding a comic vibe and pointing out the absurdity of it all without trying to stop the Klan from marching or screaming louder than they were or escalating tensions. 

*It was brilliant*. We need that Tuba Guy mentality on Reddit. Make fun of the mean people when they get too stupid, ignore them unless they get violent or break too many rules. Or just hold up a mirror and let them feel uncomfortable seeing their own words repeated to them from outside the echo chamber.

Yeah, it's an arbitrary line, in the sense that people get to decide the rules for placing that line based upon whatever concepts they want, but that doesn't make the placement of a line a wrong decision. There's plenty of rules in society about how to conduct oneself that aren't laws. A person could go into a private restaurant, or someone else's house they were invited into, and start babbling racist nonsense, and they are going to be asked to leave, and forced to if they don't cooperate. That's progress, not censorship.

Banning CoonTown doesn't remove the racists, but it removes and avenue to congregate, one that directly influences the rest of the site.

That seems pretty unlikely, though, considering how hard they're clinging to their free speech ideals even in the face of so much evidence that it's a bad idea. If anything, they could stand to move a few feet down that slippery slope. It's become clear that reddit as a whole is being way too permissive. They've created a site where toxic communities can thrive and sometimes actually hurt and abuse people, all for $0. (And for the worst stuff, it's even ad-free!) And that's now the reputation they have, too. I feel very apprehensive admitting that I'm a reddit user, and if I do mention it I feel like I need to distance myself from all the gross stuff. If the admins don't want to support terrible communities, and they want to keep the vast majority of people from feeling icky about using their site, they can and should feel free to remove the toxic stuff.

Then one (albeit semi-popular) website would have banned them.  So what?  A website is not the government.  Denying a group a voice on one website is not the same thing as taking away their human rights.

I know you're trying explain to me how free speech matters when you ignore context, but guess what.  We don't have to ignore context.

>Let's take something a little more unsettled than the humanity of black people though and apply your reasoning.

Let's not.  Let's not let our minds grow so open our brains fall out.  Let's not get lost down the rabbit-hole of moral blindness and treat things the way they actually are.

Racism is not good.  It will never be good.  Denying the humanity of black people will never be considered acceptable the way LGBT rights are becoming.  It is not an issue where there is some possible debate, where the bigoted side might have some legitimacy.

We've had this moral discussion already.  We've been having it since the times of slavery and since the times of Jim Crow, and we're still having it today.  You and others who argue for blind free speech and amorality (judging things independent of moral content) want to turn back the clock and pretend we as a species have never made the progress we already have.  That's asinine.

So no, I'm not going to talk about your hypothetical, because the situations aren't the same.  How about we actually admit that we know a bit more about morality today than we did 50 years ago?

You can't post any controversial opinion on Reddit without someone from the opposing side of that argument telling you why you're wrong. Reddit is for everyone to talk about everything.

My view is that Reddit is a collection of subreddits, each dedicated to a particular topic.  There are subreddits where discussion is free, controversial opinions are encouraged, and debates happen.  I'm not talking about that here.

What I am talking about is this idea that a dedicated hate sub, where no debate will happen, must exist because the subreddit itself is a ""side"" in some argument that needs to be happening.  This philosophy implies that, rather than occuring in a subreddit dedicated to a particular topic, that ""argument"" is something that needs to happen on *any* subreddit.  Because you aren't talking about the level of people in a sub, you are talking about an entire sub itself.

This argument would be a lot weaker were it not for the actual fact that coontown users do not stay in their little hell hole.  White nationalists see Reddit as a recruiting ground; they are making accounts and branching out to the rest of reddit to spread their hate.

>If those people don't talk on Reddit, they're not going to stop existing. They're just going to go talk somewhere else. Possibly somewhere that isn't full of people who will tell them they're wrong when they make racist comments on threads about comic books and recipes and anti-jokes.

One, members of coontown are not the only ones that make racist comments in other subreddits.  Usually those comments are ""just jokes,"" but they're hardly looked down upon.

Two, coontown members are not looking to have their views changed.  They're looking to change others.  What's more likely?  A dyed-in-the-wool racist getting convinced by someone saying ""hey, racism is bad?""  Or a random user not quite familiar with the idea of racism getting convinced by the copy-pasta of bad statistics that black people are the problem?  I'll give you a hint; the second *is already happening*.

Three, this is exactly my point; threads about comic books and recipes should not be expected to be the host of an ""argument"" about racism.  Racism as it relates to comic books, sure, but we can't look at this with the mind set that they should also be expected to deal with coontowners looking for new members.  Banning coontown doesn't make it impossible for this to happen, sure, but it does set the tone that Reddit in general isn't the place for bigotry.  There will be plenty of potential users who wouldn't bother making an account if they didn't have a home base on the site to go to.

>If people like that are going to exist, then they need to be showing up in all of those other threads, so that those arguments you're talking about can happen.

No, and that's my whole point.  There shouldn't be a Reddit-wide philosophy that says that every subreddit should also be the battlegrounds for racism.  There doesn't need to be an argument about whether black people are fully human or not, even if individual subs always have the power to either permit or forbid those conversations themselves.

>I expect most of the ""debate"" with these racists to take the form of other users telling them to shut the fuck up and shaming them for having such idiotic opinions.

It isn't working that way.  The way it works is that straight up ""black people are not human"" comments are downvoted and whisked away.  However, endless ""jokes"" about black people being theives or lazy or violent, or endless posts about black people that commit a crime with endless ""dindu nuffin"" posts, and endless stormfront copypastas with fake statistics are upvoted and encouraged.

Bigots aren't idiots, and Reddit culture is too obsessed with ascribing harmless intent to these jokes and faux even-handedness to call out the more subtle bigotry.

Anderson Cooper didn't create the issue of risky content, though. It was endemic to the entire purpose of that sub. Jailbait was full of problematic-though-just-skirting-illegal content for years and Reddit didn't give a honeybadgering fuck. Cooper mentions it publicly, and they scramble to kill the PR-nightmare monster they created. That was my point.

Let's quote the seceding documents of the states that seceded.

MISSISSIPPI:

>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.

TEXAS:

>Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?

SOUTH CAROLINA:

>The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.

GEORGIA:

>The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.

1st Vice-President of the CSA:

>The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution — African slavery as it exists amongst us — the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization"" and further that ""Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea [""equality of the races""]; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.

Because they are in charge of moderating discussions in the community. That's what moderating *is*. Community enforcement of the rules is not always desirable. Subs like /r/AskScience would be ruined if they left it up to a vote. 

If you want moderation-lite communities, nothing is stopping you from making one.

> If mods aren't going to respect the community up and downvote anymore, then why does the idea that making a new community get to be the only solution to a bad moderator?

I don't understand the question. If you don't like a community, create a new one and set up the rules you think it should have.

> I think that if admins are going to implement sitewide shadowbans on behalf of mods

What do you mean ""on behalf of the mods""? Sitewide shadowbans are for breaking site rules, not for breaking subreddit rules. They are made on behalf of the site itself. Moderators don't have any say in who is shadowbanned. 

> Why can mods abuse the community,

In what ways can mods abuse their community? 

If community members feel unwanted or dislike how the community is run, nothing is keeping them there. They can go elsewhere. This has happened a ton of times on reddit. 

> It is not like I can create a new subreddit and then go advertise for it. Mods will hide my posts and then shadowban my account. That actually also means I lose the subreddit I just created. A shadowbanned account is useless as the owner of a subreddit.

And, in /u/spez's first AMA he addressed the issue of growth by saying this:

It also examines and searches for the solutions to the very well documented very high suicide rates among young adult males compared to young adult females.

That's a nice thing to say, but guess what! You already *do* that! There are already a *lot* of restrictions on what you can say or post on Reddit!

So really, it's a question of where we put those lines, it's not a question of whether or not those lines should be there. *There are already rules.* Let's not kid ourselves there, huh?

Reddit is not a government. It can put whatever restrictions it wants to on content submissions, and *it already does.* 

>Except that no one ever said it was about letting people ""learn the issues."" People aren't having these conversations just because they want to ""learn the issues,"" they're having these conversations because they want to talk about something that's on their minds.

I took /u/spez's commentary to mean ""We need to keep these hate subreddits around because society needs to have that conversation and that conversation is valuable.""

My point is that, past a certain point, that conversation *is not valuable* and validating it by allowing it on your site is not valuable either. Again, Reddit already has ideas that it enforces about what is and is not valuable, so playing the ""everything is valuable! Allow everything!"" game is not relevant here.

Either it's everything, or there are lines, and where to put those lines is the entire point of my post.

That's not what I'm saying. It's more like ""Here is what other people have already said on this topic, and here is why we don't want to discuss it here.

&gt;Is there any more serious evidence of SRS abuse? All of this is ~~8 months or older~~ a mix of different dates, so some more recent evidence would be greatly appreciated. It would be good to know if we're in the right here or if we need to reevaluate; however, I'm fairly certain that we're not the shit posters here. I can foresee another bout of SRS related drama flaring up soon. It would be nice to find something recent to support our position because then nobody would be able to claim that SRS has changed.

&gt;Let's please avoid duplicates. Go for the two deep rule: don't post something as evidence it can be reached within one click of a source. If you have to go deeper, then feel free to post it.

&gt;Update: the admin /u/intortus is no longer a part of the admin team and is now a mod of SRS, as shown by [this](http://i.imgur.com/K0ZHZY2.jpg?1) picture (as of 3/19/14). This is clear evidence that at least one admin is affiliated with SRS in a clear way, thus giving credibility to the notion that SRS has or had at least *partial* admin support.

&gt;Update: There is also evidence that SRS is promoting or otherwise supporting the doxxing of /u/violentacrez. RationalWiki has a section on Reddit and the moderator there is pro-SRS; in the section on /u/violentacrez, there is personal information (name and location) about where he lives. I won't link to it, but you can look for yourself.

4491,65f1p,ctljbx4,t1_ctlh1hu,t3_3f10up,1438265908.0,1,"Take an idea or concept that is intertwined in our culture. This idea is a terrible one, but it's deeply rooted in our history. Everybody comes across it in their lives, and everyone handles it differently. I myself, despite it not being in my best interest, have certainly been on both sides.

But there shouldn't really be sides to begin with, should there? Ideally, this would be openly discussed, yes. In our schools, in our households. Commonly, in the households of people of color, this issue can't help but be discussed. Because that is the nature of this idea, color. Or, the value of. Subsequently, because it's discussed in these households, issues of race are handled far better by people of color. The white people who openly discuss this in an appropriate environment share similar behavior of handling racial issues in a positive scope.

But to be sure, this discussion is best served in a friendly, open, and non-judgemental environment.

But sadly, the grand scope of American culture, and broadly western and even world culture, this discussion does not occur. Instead it's ignored or swept under the rug. The consequences are severe. Children, often white but not always (such as myself once upon a time), grow up very confused. Questions occur, but answers are deflected, or worse, met with anger. Confusion leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate. To be sure, that previous sentence is a gross oversimplification, but I trust you understand. I see it all the time. Confused kids who respond with anger at the idea of things like ""affirmative action"" or the fact that a ""BET"" exists. But what it absolutely never leads to is understanding.

Now, where we are at on Reddit is unprecedented in human history. I don't think that /u/spez, who at this point is quite clearly a white supremacist, realizes just exactly what precipice we are at. it might not seem unimportant now, it's ""just the internet"" after all.  But our choices and our voices here may invariably be just exactly what will be taught in history classes a hundred years from now. So what do we do?

Ideally, we would have a platform previously suggested. One that is open, friendly, and non-judgemental. I've seen them on Reddit, and I've seen them work. I've seen people become far more enlightened upon racial issues than even they could imagine. It's great. But to be sure, this is not the responsibility of the administrators. This is a community effort. All we need is to be sure that such communities don't get wiped out. This option is also not exclusive to the other two.

Now, before proceeding, since I don't know you, I want you instead to imagine someone. A kid. White, tall, brown hair, stubble. (Literally just exactly every video game protagonist's default settings.) Because this kid has never had the opportunity to discuss racial issues, this kid is confused and angry. I've met these kids. They are raised in white culture which shuns any productive points of view, it's depressing. Especially since if it's head weren't up it's ass, white culture could do a lot of good. (Though to be fair, that could be said about all our cultures. Even ISIL could do some good if they reorganized their priorities.)

Now imagine this kid logs on Reddit.

In one instance, there is a coontown. He gets invited to it. And what does he see? He sees the full manifestation of ignorance, he sees a vitriol that for all it's incomprehensible wrath and anger, it resonates with him. Why? It's not because this kid is a bad person, but because their frustration has bits and pieces that echo his own. I know this because I've had the ""open discussion"" with such white gentlemen who have been in similar positions. What it is, is a trap. It's the same trap used by gangs to recruit, for cults to recruit, even for the military to recruit. They offer a ""release valve"" that becomes an illusion of relation, or family. In this case, this family is based upon such things as harassing black and black ally members of Reddit, attacking sub-reddits designed for people of color, doxxing reddit users of color, celebrating the death of black people, celebrating murderers and terrorists who kill black people, and utilizing outdated or misunderstood science to advocate their own superiority (despite being oblivious to the irony of their own situation.) On top of this, it's a network. While coontown is the ""front page"" of white nationalists, it allows people to contact each other and spread information through other means. For example, I can't teach you to make a bomb and tell you where to place it out here in the open on reddit. But because you and I are all buddy-buddy and you've been a part of my community for some time, I'll ask for a secondary form of communication and we can go kill some people. (If this sounds like how terrorists organizations might behave, you would be correct. The thing is, the Aryan Nation has never had access to so many people as it does now.)

There is also the option of wiping out adversarial platforms. Now imagine this kid logs on Reddit and such places are no longer a factor. Now they can't brigade and spread their lies and misinformation. There is no ground for them to plant their seeds. And by culling the weeds, the garden can now flourish. And so too would this kid's mind and heart. Yes, he comes confused and angry. Maybe even scared. But without a platform, the white supremacists have no network, and so attempts at recruitment would be fractured and slow. They *might* find a way to get a hold of this kid, and maybe work with him. But this kid now has reason to deny such advances. Because before, they would have been sanctioned by Reddit's admins. Endorsed by them. This would make the kid feel such ideas are normal and that this is where he belongs. But now? Now it's clearly something shady, and should be ignored just like solicitations for penis enlargement pills.

Or... to put it simply: Let's pretend you are Emperor Palpatine. What would you prefer? If Darth Vader came to you and said, *""Yup. I destroyed the rebel alliance and you are free to rule as you see fit.""* Or if he said, *""I was going to kill the rebel alliance, but then I gave them this sweet star destroyer of their very own where they can vent their anger and frustration.

From Wikipedia on the issue:

>Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves. Self-verification is the drive to reinforce the existing self-image and self-enhancement is the drive to seek positive feedback. Both are served by confirmation biases.[137] In experiments where people are given feedback that conflicts with their self-image, they are less likely to attend to it or remember it than when given self-verifying feedback.[138][139][140] **They reduce the impact of such information by interpreting it as unreliable.[138][141][142]**

You have said that you have been presented with the effects of socioeconomics and violence before.  If not, here it is [again](http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/factsheet-violence.aspx).  Yet, you dismiss it because of confirmation bias.  It would force you to change your deep seeded world view of ""lesser"" races, and we as people fight that to our very core.

To use it to squelch and control actual user's political speech is, in my eyes, a detestable practice though. This happens all the time here on reddit. That is admin territory though. Much more common are subreddit banns.

See, it use to be the admins tried to put up a front of professional aloofness, just letting their pet powermods do the dirty work (as they still do). Lately even that curtain has dropped, and the admins are doing the shit work themselves, in plain view. Straight up banning select subs while letting others go on, even though they are guilty of exactly the same. /r/ShitRedditSays is one major hub of superMods that control dosens, if not hundereds of other subs, many of them defaults. The admins are completely ignoring, even condoning the cancerous behavior of this minorty of super powerful mods, and the blatant censorship of reddit for their own political and monetary gain.

Look up any of the ""undelete"" type subreddits. There are examples galore of the monitization and blatant censorship that really goes on here. It has been heading in this direction for years, and lately is really picking up speed.

Oh, I fully agree with you. We desperately need full transparency for sub banns. Legitimate anti-spam shadow banning needs to be secret, or it defeats the purpose, but it needs to be bedrock solid policy to NEVER use that for political or profit purposes against common users, simply because of a difference of opinion.
The same should go for mods banning people because of thier own petty beliefs. Freedom of speach is what this forum was designed on, and to try to control the ""direction"" of that is not only deserving of ridicule, but it is insanely misguided.

Well, then the battle is already lost because reddit has always censored tons of stuff. Things like doxxing, which aren't technically illegal unless they're harassment, are forbidden site-wide and have been for as long as I can remember. Jailbait is another example. That one, they censored due to bad media coverage basically. You're not even allowed to post links to other parts of reddit and say ""Hey, everyone down vote this!"" or anything like that. There's no law against brigading, that's entirely reddit's decision. 

>There are lots of distasteful things to be found on reddit and lots of wonderful things too. That's because right now reddit is a mirror that reflects humanity. The good and the bad. 

And that's a lovely idea, but I think there are two problems with that. One, most people don't come to the reddit ""mirror"" looking to see the worst that humanity has to offer. So gradually, the only people coming to reddit are those who either can tolerate the gross stuff, or those who are rolling around in it. Two, it helps to not just reflect, but *amplify* the worst in humanity by giving them a great place to congregate and organize. That's fine if reddit want to do that, it's their site, but I don't think it's a good idea. Plus, if you're looking for a mirror, the internet as a whole is a much better, fairer, more accurate mirror than reddit alone could ever be. 

>If people have a problem with something someone says on Reddit they are misguided if they try to blame Reddit for that person's opinions, and they are fooling themselves if they think that removing those ideas from reddit will make them go away.

I don't disagree. Censorship alone isn't going to get rid of ideas. They have a point, though: Reddit is voluntarily hosting this terrible stuff, and they don't have to. Is that making Reddit better? Is it making the internet better? Is it making the world better? I think it's fair to criticize them for their choice, because it is a choice, and I don't think ""free speech"" alone justifies it. 

>You are supporting the idea that people should be able to come together and discuss whatever they want freely.

They should be able to come together and discuss freely... but that doesn't mean that reddit has to give them free, prime real estate to do it. 

>Reddit has still managed to keep working toward the ideal that people should be able to talk about whatever they want.

That's a good ideal, and I agree with it, but it isn't reddit's responsibility to make that happen on their own. Every website censors content to some degree, reddit is no different. Is it really so bad if the racists have to start their own forum? Frankly, I think it's a win-win. The racists no longer have to fear a ban by the admins, because they are the admins, and the rest of us can choose whether or not we want to support their efforts, see their posts, etc. Free speech lives on stronger than ever, and if you look at both the new racist site and reddit.com, *more* ideas are being expressed, not less.

>""The worst of the worst"" according to what? ""Borderline cases"" according to what? The ""free exchange of ideas"" limited to a subset of approved ideas is*n't* a free exchange of ideas at all.

Yeah, it isn't. I don't care if reddit, or any other site, restricts the speech they allow. Especially when the topics being banned are so reprehensible. As long as everyone is equally free to create their own site discussing whatever they want however they want, the free exchange of ideas is there, and my desire for freedom of speech is satisfied.

Agreed however from a purely philosophical perspective can you please tell me the Powerball numbers for next week because I am very poor and want money... also PM me them so I don't have to share. :D

>We don't have to ignore context.

I totally get your point of view and I dismiss it categorically. I'm not advocating for the devil. I feel very strongly on the subject of freedom of discourse. And I honestly believe that any time you insert the morality of an individual or small group as a filter to what can be discussed by the whole you harm that process. 

My grandmother, who was a child during WWII used to talk about the ""sneaky"" Japanese and how they could not be trusted. Racism straight the fuck out of WWII US propaganda and that racism and fear was used to imprison Japanese US Citizens and destroy lives. I loved my Nana and yet I cringe whenever I remember this side of her. 

My current housemate occasionally uses the word nigger and to me it's literally like hitting me with a low powered stun gun. Makes me SO uncomfortable. I let him know I don't like it. And I try to make sure he knows it isn't a good thing nor would most of society accept it but if he never said it how would I know he thought this way? How could I engage him and try to change him?

Your argument that giving these people a platform... and you seem specifically targeting the coon town people I think, somehow legitimizes them. I don't think that's true. reddit is a buffet. Users choose the meal they wish to partake in. No one who wants to deal with the racists of a certain subreddit are forced to. What's more any time their message bleeds out of their shitty sanctum there are rules on the site that will correct that behavior. And those rules and tools will be getting better. 

But I'll never agree that denying someone the right to express their opinion is the way to go. I've been shot at on three continents in service to my country and freedom of expression is one of my core beliefs. And while I realize that this site is not a governmental entity I feel that if the philosophy is good enough to be codified by law in my country it is good enough for one of the biggest internet platforms in the world.

They also scrambled to kill the massive legal vulnerability Cooper exposed, heh. *That* was *my* point. :P

> Furthermore, you can't be under the impression that overtly illegal forms of racism (everything from discriminatory hiring practices to hate crimes) are born in a vacuum, can you?

Of course not. But hosting a racist discussion still isn't illegal. I'm wasn't talking about what's morally correct; I was pointing out that there was another perfectly valid line of reasoning that would have led to them taking the same result.

>And like with JailBait, there is no possible good and infinite possible bad that can come out of them hosting a sub like CoonTown.

I can think of a couple potential benefits, actually:

* It provides a nice, centralized location for folks to keep track of what those people are up to, which can be handy for dealing with any illegal activity that does spawn from it. Consider how much more difficult that would be if those discussions were being held in a private, invite-only forum.

* Likewise, it provides a nice example we can hold up of what *not* to do - ""These ideas are racist and bad. If you find yourself saying things that are also being said here, you may want to re-examine your ideas."" It helps us form counter-arguments to refute the points they make. It lets us learn from the mistakes of others, whether or not they recognize those mistakes themselves.

* It gives the opportunity for these folks to better themselves together, without losing their community, if they so choose. Not especially likely, but possible.

But the single biggest benefit is that it upholds the societal value of free speech (which is what resulted in the enshrining of the legal protection of free speech in the Constitution). The general idea is that what the majority thinks is right and wrong is not always spot-on, so we should allow minority opinions to be expressed even if almost everyone disagrees with them.

Imagine if we were having this conversation fifty years ago, and the sub in question wasn't Coontown but instead /r/ainbow. Overwhelming majority would likely say that sort of thing was incredibly immoral and shouldn't be tolerated - but now society has changed its views and recognized that being LGBTQ isn't a deadly sin. (I could see something loosely similar happening with pedophilia in the next few decades - recognizing that the desires themselves maybe can't be fully suppressed, but they can be managed and minimized, and that some things which are currently banned may have a use in that. **Pure speculation; not saying I support pedophilia.**)

Sometimes the majority isn't right, and we need to allow for that, by not outright banning the expressing of certain views. This lets us be exposed to ideas we disagree with, which is all-around a very good thing (this is a cornerstone of a good college education, btw); it makes us rethink about *why* we believe what we do, reinforcing the beliefs we find to still be valid and changing the views that we don't find to be valid.

Then comes the argument about whether or not that should be happening *here*, on reddit. To me, that's something for the folks who run reddit - the admins - to decide. And it seems they've mostly decided that yeah, there should still be a place for that around here, though it maybe should look a little different. I'm absolutely not going to break out the pitchforks for them taking that stance.",False,False,1438188004.0,179692,20948,1353219310.0,False,False

All completely true.

They aren't. 

>Are moderators lying and claiming accounts are SPAM accounts when they are not?

No. The issue I think you may be having difficulty with here is the purpose of a shadowban. From my reading of your comments (and correct me if I'm wrong), you're thinking shadowbans are for spammers. Yes, that is their original purpose and their stated purpose, but that is naive. They are used for all bans handed out by the admins. Why is that you ask? Because that's the only one they have. It is the only type of site-wide ban built into the system because until relatively recently (before the massive increase in the population of this website and the trolls and hate it brought with it) spam was one of the only community issues that required admin intervention. There has been no reason to create a public hardban because no one has cared until recently. Now that there is such an uproar, there is supposedly one being developed. Yay. The big spooky shadowbans are going away, everyone can rest easy and enjoy a hard ban to the same effect. 

No one is deceiving the admins and tricking them into thinking regular users are spammers. The admins aren't rubber stamping bans. They have tools above and beyond the moderators, they see a lot more. They can see what links an account has visited, where it has voted, where it came from, where it went next, the IP, browser session information, a lot of stuff. People are not getting banned for nothing, they are getting banned for breaking the rules. Don't be misled by the people you see saying ""I did nothing wrong and the admins are ignoring me!"" Four years here and I've never met someone who said that and was telling the truth (as evidenced by yesterday's post in /r/videos).

>On top of that, ghosting individual comments is a tool provided to mods by admins. Mods can't ghost comments if admins don't let them.

True as well. This is an Automoderator function, which started out as a user created bot that was not associated with the admins in any way. It was only later after its creator was hired by reddit inc that it became integrated into the site. 

> I would argue that admins should not be giving tools to mods that allow them to hide individual comments at will in a way users will most likely never detect.

The answer for this is simple. This is a result of mods using anti-spam features to pseudo ban a user. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop mods from doing this without taking those anti-spam capabilities away entirely, which would be a colossally stupid thing to do. The two abilities are one in the same, completely tied together. There is no way to remove one without removing the other. 

>Technically mods using them to hide opinions is an abuse of those tools. Why are admins not banning mods who do that?

This goes back to my other point. Because the mods' word is law in their subreddit if they chose to make it so. That is the official sitewide policy. They can hide or promote any content they want to as long as it isn't child pornography or personal information.

This is hilarious and horrible and untrue.  Raising morale can be incredibly important.  And no, you don't do it by ""cleaning up a park"".  You do it by improving communication, honesty, trust, transparency, etc. This is usually easier if you have an in-person relationship.

I'd argue not. (Apologies for the US-centric metaphor, but given the US majority userbase here I think it speaks well.)

Reddit has to acknowledge that it is a large, popular site. There are very few, possibly no, others like it. Giving people a place to talk here, where there are so many others to share a discussion, is a very different thing from giving people a place to talk on some dying web 1.0 site. A new domain name is not going to provide the community and exciting diversity that reddit already has. We saw this when a lot of people started talking about ""reddit alternatives""—they tried finding a new door. It hasn't really worked. Nothing has matched reddit. Because the diversity of this website is what makes these conversations valuable.

**Title:** Free Speech

**Title-text:** I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.

Frankly, I don't see how asking people not to make hurtful (racist, sexist, etc.) comments is really too much to ask of Reddit. These ""jokes"" normalize the kind of hateful behavior that is cancerously growing on Reddit and trivialize the everyday experiences of legitimate forms of oppression.

Sure, /u/pcgamer27 might think that its funny to joke about the experiences of underprivileged people... the fact is that when Redditors make these edgy jokes, Reddit becomes a slightly more offensive, more hostile, and more hateful community towards people that have historically been driven towards the fringes of society.

The nature of the joke is important; a joke at the expense of black/AA people makes Reddit more welcoming to communities like the ""Chimpire"" and a joke about hurting or abusing a woman makes Reddit slightly more welcoming to r/beatingwomen.

That's the usual quoted context of the idea I was referring to, which is neither disclaiming responsibility, nor is it an immature idea. Quite the opposite, really. It suggests that each of us look not only at others behavior, but also at our own perception of those behaviors. If you're constantly seeing other people as having a problem, perhaps it's your perception that is the problem. He/She has ""**never** observed one who had emotionally matured past the age of 3"" (emphasis added). Should we draw the conclusion that **nobody** has matured past the age of 3? No, that's obviously not true. Apparently, there is some context, most likely a biased one, that has shaped their perception to draw an inaccurate conclusion on this point. Confirmation bias, which we are all subject to, will reaffirm this position in their mind, and they will continue to perceive immaturity even where it doesn't actually exist.

I intentionally didn't disagree with the rest of their sentiment, because there will certainly be people who opt-in and then complain about the content that they agreed to see. Some will even do this intentionally, or even maliciously. And yeah, those people need to take responsibility for themselves and quit shitting on other people's right to free speech. What I disagreed with is the overall stereotyping view towards the mentality and maturity of those types of people, and thus that is the point I replied to. When a comment is riddled with all encompassing pronouns that are not given any identifier (read the comment again, they never say exactly who they are referring to), it's a big red flag that this is a presumptive, biased, and stereotyping view of whatever disembodied group mentality they are standing against.

I respectfully disagree with that view. Nobody is muting anybody.

The sub will still exist. People that opt-in, and subscribers will still be there to listen. To use my previous analogy, you're asking that people be required to leave their windows open so people can scream their obscenities to everyone, whether they want to hear them or not.

The friend's windows will be shut when we get to his house, because he doesn't want to hear it either. He wants his home to be free of those opinions, and that's his right to do so. But, he's ensuring that his visitors have the option to open those windows and stick their head out to hear what everyone else is saying. And if that bothers any of his visitors, they're free to go to someone else's house.

Bottom line, just because people don't want to hear what you have to say, that doesn't mean you're being muted. I think some people are just bent out of shape because this particular house is being retrofitted with thicker windows.

Now, I will say, as I have said previously in another comment in this thread, that there are definitely cases of blatant censorship on Reddit, and some are happening on completely ""Safe Space"" approved subs.

Things like doxxing, which aren't technically illegal unless they're harassment, are forbidden site-wide and have been for as long as I can remember. Jailbait is another example. 

Doxxing isn't illegal but it is a legal minefield and opens reddit to all kinds of liability. I understand why they take the stand they do against it. It's to protect them and their users. It also helps protect the free exchange of ideas because I can post openly without worrying as much that I'm going to tracked down and attacked in the real world for my statements here. A compromise certainly, but a reasonable one. 

Jailbait wasn't taken down because the idea behind it was declared unacceptable. It was taken down because it became a liability after it was found that people were using it to request illegal material (for the record, the illegal stuff was only sent over PM, nothing illegal was posted to the subreddit directly). The negative media attention was certainly a motivation as well and in that aspect reddit failed to live up to its ideals, but it has allowed the idea behind that subreddit to continue in its replacement which thrives to this day. Reddit isn't perfect, but it tries and as long it keeps trying I'll support it.  

Brigading is a complex subject currently under a lot of debate. Part of the reasoning behind the anti-brigading rule is that it hurts the free exchange of ideas especially for minority opinions when large groups of people can coordinate to bury what it doesn't agree with and ""punish"" users who dare to even discuss those things. Personally I hope that Reddit ultimately decides to go after those kinds of coordinated attacks while leaving subreddits that serve to direct people to cool or interesting posts and subreddits out of it. I have a ""spreading ideas is good, attacking ideas is bad"" sort of view on Brigading. We've yet to see what the rules end up like. 

> most people don't come to the reddit ""mirror"" looking to see the worst that humanity has to offer.

Most people will never see the worst either, not unless they actively look for it. No one is forcing new users into coontown to talk about things they don't want to. People *should* expect to be exposed to unpleasant things on the internet, just like in the real world. Reddit already gives people the ability to filter out the things they don't want to see and create their own experience. They are going a step farther and putting the more unpopular stuff behind another wall (opt in). This isn't really a problem. 

>  it helps to not just reflect, but amplify the worst in humanity by giving them a great place to congregate and organize.

Same with the good. It's not really an issue with reddit, it happens everywhere like-minded people gather. Providing a place for people to get together, organize and discuss things is a good thing. What results from that is up to the people involved. I don't think the internet makes a better mirror than reddit, because reddit *is* a part of the internet. Reddit is the internet mirror focused on a wide area. What you see is people doing people stuff.

> Reddit is voluntarily hosting this terrible stuff, and they don't have to. Is that making Reddit better? Is it making the internet better? Is it making the world better? 

I think it does. I really do. Reddit doesn't have to be a platform for the open exchange of ideas and the building of communities. It could be lots of other things. A curated list of approved topics, or a cat photo repository for example, but the internet is a better when it has a well maintained site for free discussion where ideas are shared and challenged. There are few places like that, fewer popular ones and even fewer that are run as well. reddit fills a gap very well. It's why we are all here. 

> They should be able to come together and discuss freely... but that doesn't mean that reddit has to give them free, prime real estate to do it....  it isn't reddit's responsibility to make that happen on their own. Every website censors content to some degree, reddit is no different. Is it really so bad if the racists have to start their own forum? ...  As long as everyone is equally free to create their own site discussing whatever they want however they want, the free exchange of ideas is there

So this is the ""They can have freedom too, just not here"" argument. It's not compelling. There are a lot of good reasons why Reddit should stay available to everyone. By not censoring ideas here they avoid having to even start down the path of what do we keep and what do we censor. It absolves them of all responsibility for the content on this site. Once they officially endorse certain ideas and ban others everything they allow on the site is a reflection on them personally, right now they are just providing the space and users are responsible for what they do with it.  

It also makes them popular. Everyone is here discussing what matters to them no matter what it is. They could be fragmented into a million forums all over the internet, but by having everything in one place Reddit gains a ton of users each with unique contributions to make. Perhaps some of them have some misguided views on certain subjects but are respected experts in other areas. By having them here they can share with the rest of us, and we can expose them to different views as well.  

We'll take racists as an easy example. A bunch of racists on their own forum are completely insular but as a part of reddit they can be exposed to very different opinions and views from all over the world. It may not sway many of them, but it very well might help some of them. It also allows those of us who aren't part of those groups to explore them, to try to understand them and how they work if we're interested. It's easier to observe those types of things here than to try to track down and join closed tight-knit groups scattered all over the web.

It's part of us as human beings. It can be managed, but attempting to suppress it or deny it outlets tends to backfire. 

Besides, allowing people to speak their minds - no matter how abhorrent their speech can sometimes be - lets you know where people stand. In my neck of the woods, the whole Confederate flag thing is a *big* subject. I personally have long identified it as an emblem of a certain mindset, as a badge racists and hateful people tend to rally behind.

And now that it's come to the fore in our national conversation, some people are realizing it's long past time for that flag to go. They're looking into their hearts and changing. And others... have slathered their cars with rebel flag bumper stickers, stuck large flagpoles into their trucks for display, and taken to wearing shirts and hats with the flag on it. It's meant to be provocative, to anger others and simultaneously make the flag's defenders feel empowered as the world moves away from them. 

And that's good. It's showing everyone who the bigots and apologists are in their community. And it's letting those same people vent, after which we can slowly move on. If we were to ban the flag outright, and/or ban their outlets of expression (like subreddits here) it would just move those people underground, give them more of a sense of grievance and community, hide them from public view, and potentially turn them into a festering menace. 

Better to let them stomp around and be petulant, where everyone can watch them and they can feel better about themselves. Better to let them be mean and possibly hurt our feelings, and thereby allow us all to grow and be open about those emotions.

You're going to have to define civilization, given that empires like Mali have existed in history, the idea that ""civilization building"" is exclusive to whites is some seriously bad declaration.

Of which is tied to literacy and resources, as it turns out education for blacks (in the context of the US) only recently started becoming desgregated. It's no surprise that IQ and test scores would be lower when educational resources were withheld and denied for 100 years.

Post-colonial world called, it wants to tell you that a near century of exploitation has created a large disparity of wealth since those ""white countries"" leeched off the wealth and resources of ""black countries.""

> the history of Haiti and how blacks ran it into the ground

You mean the country that won it's independence and then subsequently was blockaded by the French for ""lost income?"" Because having trade denied to you for being one of the first to decolonized means that it's entirely their fault?

Right, the continent that was carved up and redistributed in the 1800s and was only beginning to be decolonized in the late 60s-70s while plenty of people were fighting over infrastructure that was made specifically to remove resources from the area?

5172,4re8s,ctlnlaa,t1_ctldc0l,t3_3f10up,1438272382.0,3,"> If this site TRULY wants to advocate free speech

And this is exactly my point: I don't think they should, at least not to this degree. Free speech is a great thing to a point, but some of it is harmful. Even the first amendment, which is one of the strongest guarantees of free speech in the world, has exceptions. Governments and other monopolies like, say, the root DNS, should be held to the highest standard of free speech possible, because anything they do censor can have a powerful chilling effect, unfairly destroying entire areas of discourse. They need to tread very carefully when considering the lines between free speech, harassment, threats, hate speech, etc. because the damage that can be done is so great. 

Reddit is trying to meet that standard too, but they don't have to. It's a private website providing free discussion forums to anyone who wants to form a community, but it's just one site on the entire web. The code is even open source, so it's not even the only place where you can have a reddit-style community. The threat posed by tyrannical admins is minimal at best. Worst case scenario, everyone goes to voat or back to Digg or whatever. 

Of course, they can choose to hold themselves to a high standard anyway, for idealistic reasons, but I don't think that it's working out well for anyone. In some cases, there's interesting and good debate happening about controversial things. Social justice has been a big deal here in recent years, and I've learned a lot and expanded my mind as a result. There's perennial topics like abortion and circumcision and men's rights and feminism and affirmative action where passions run high but people are still capable of having a discussion about it, and even changing their minds once in a while. That stuff is all great, and I'm all in favor of keeping it around even if one side is offensive to the other side. Then there's things like coontown, or pics of dead kids, or raping women, or fat people hate, and many variations on those. These places aren't enabling a rational discourse. No one is experiencing new and interesting ideas as a result of these places. They're just gross and harmful. As evidenced by the fact that even reddit, with its singleminded pursuit of free speech above all else, is hiding these terrible places behind a wall so that people don't see them. If there's such a concern about giving them a space too, why hide it from everyone else? Why create second-class citizens? It solves nothing, because they lose their free speech cred but they also don't fix any of the criticism they're getting!

And giving these communities a free home online doesn't just have minimal benefit, it's also got serious drawbacks. These groups get a huge platform to spread their hatred, they get talked about because of all the controversy, and they drag down the reputation of the site as a whole. Stormfront has been around for ages, and they're just as terrible as coontown, so what's the difference? The difference is no one gives a shit about Stormfront because they're doing their own thing on their own site. The coontown people are doing it here, and people talk about them because it's scandalous to have such virulent racism on one of the top sites. They all already have accounts here. When they're looking at their shit, it's right there intermixed with mainstream content. They get to feel normal, because hey, they're just using reddit like anyone else, and they're seeing all the same stuff. It's so easy for them to feel comfortable writing racist shit whenever a black person is in a video because reddit lets them create a world that is more racist than the world actually is. And those comments spread and draw more racist comments in mainstream subreddits. Or someone debates them and mentions their posting history, and all the other racists or even just misguided people get links to where they can find more racism. And again, it's all on reddit, a mainstream site, so it's getting a boost of legitimacy. This is a choice that reddit makes, to enable the spread of racism, and it's fair to criticize them for it. 

That's all fine for reddit if that's the kind of site they want to run. You can choose to have a free site where anything goes, or you can have a site where people feel comfortable just mentioning that they're black or a woman. But you can't have both. Censorship will drive the people you're censoring away, but in this case, with those people left unchecked they have created a site with a reputation for shitty stuff, which also keeps people away. You can't satisfy everyone, so who should reddit satisfy? Personally, I pick the non-racists every time. We aren't giving them the Internet death penalty here, we're just making them live somewhere else. The ones we drive away will be replaced by much better and more interesting people with different viewpoints than the typical nerdy white males of reddit. That's a much better catalyst for free speech than the ""opportunity"" to hear the same racist garbage over and over. 

All the concerns at this point are hypothetical, and the benefits of banning them are real. Reddit as a site will not suffer if the racist networks alone get shut down. They are doing zero good and plenty of harm. It *might* suffer if they start shutting down other stuff, but they don't seem likely to go too far, if anything they won't go far enough, and when they do really make a mistake they'll hear plenty of backlash for it and be able to undo it.

That's right. It took decades for neo-Nazism to have a resurgence in a nation that banned Nazism. In America, by contrast, the KKK and neo-Nazis literally never went away and have basically thrived for the entire period of time that they weren't thriving in Germany. That's how well ""education"" and not banning an idea works.

>There's a huge difference between not banning them and ""welcoming them and refusing to object"". Please, don't be dishonest with your arguments.

So where are all these objections to the racists, sexists, and homophobes of Reddit? Pretty much confined to SRS and similar subs. The bigots have been given the run of this place.

2.) If your true concern is violence and it's prevention, please move to East St. Louis and ask the black people to stop killing each other and white people all the time. Social justice isn't worth much online, but if you hit the streets where the violence is taking place you may have a much better impact on the small portion of the population who commit the most crime and murder in this country.


Also, CoonTown is not a 'white supremacy' sub-reddit. We're a sub-reddit based on FACTS. We have a lot of Asians in the sub-reddit for example, and I will not argue with the FACT that Asians have a higher than average IQ of your white American. Why would I argue with that? It's factual science backed by a large number of studies on racial differences. I'm white, do I get offended at this fact? Of course not, nor do others. We don't sit around and circlejerk over the notion that 'white is best'. We're a diverse group who come together because we simply see a big problem in America (and abroad): Blacks. Whether it be Somali immigrants entering Europe or the ghetto thugs who'll rob you at gun point for the $13 in your wallet and your iPhone.

The simple truth is that each time the topic of CoonTown comes up, we gain many more supporters as people open their eyes to the *truth*. They realize that they don't need to hide their thoughts and feelings like they are a closet-gay in 1930's Germany. They're welcome in CoonTown and can 'come out' as being a race realist there.

EDIT: If you'd like an honest debate there is a sticky thread at the top of CoonTown requesting those who are against us to disprove our big list of facts and information. Unlike other subs, we don't immediately ban and remove content that doesn't fit our narrative and we welcome alternate views and opinions (as long as you're genuinely curious and trying to have a discussion).",False,False,False,985,282,1437918488.0,False,False

>It provides a nice, centralized location for folks to keep track of what those people are up to, which can be handy for dealing with any illegal activity that does spawn from it

Do you really think people are going to openly discuss illegal activity *on* coontown where they know they're being watched? No. they'll just take it to those private spaces.

>Likewise, it provides a nice example we can hold up of what not to do - ""These ideas are racist and bad. If you find yourself saying things that are also being said here, you may want to re-examine your ideas."" 

It's not like we don't have enough examples of racism already. There are reams and reams of shitty racist opinions that have been spewed. If you want, archive all of coontown's contents as some kind of library of shit. Nothing of value is being added by allowing them to continue.

>It gives the opportunity for these folks to better themselves together, without losing their community, if they so choose. Not especially likely, but possible.

You think people's opinions are more likely to change in a racist echo chamber than outside of it? This makes literally 0 sense. The only community they have is being a bunch of racist assholes, which is not one worth having.

>But the single biggest benefit is that it upholds the societal value of free speech

People still have the freedom to run their own shitty racist websites and have their shitty racist clubs and be racist in their own homes. What you're essentially saying is that nobody should ever be prevented from venting whatever opinions they have in whatever context. I.e. it would be morally wrong to throw someone out of an LGBT support group for being a vicious homophobe. It's good that people have the right to exchange whatever ideas they want, but people have the right control behaviour in their own communities.

>Sometimes the majority isn't right, and we need to allow for that, by not outright banning the expressing of certain views.

This is not one of those times. The views of /r/coontown subscribers are definitely wrong.

Upvotes and downvotes determine what the community likes. Not all communities exist to cater to what the community likes in that way. Well curated material is more valuable in some spaces than user curated material.

The reason you see so few communities like that is because they suck and never catch on. 

> They are not there to use admin sanctioned mod tools to enforce their opinions on all posters. That is supposed to be up to the community's up and down voting, not mod opinions.

They are *supposed* to set up whatever rules they feel are best for the community, and then the community can decide if they like how that subreddit is structured. Your ideal subreddit is just one of many ways to run a subreddit, and it's a path that no one goes down because *it doesn't work*. 

> Don't talk in generalities. List 3 ways to advertise a new subreddit that mods cannot block. You said tons, so this should be an easy task for you.

Post about it in threads on a related topic. If you're worried about competing subreddits deleting your post, do it in communities outside the competing subreddit. 

Advertise it in /r/newreddits/, /r/newsubreddits, /r/obscuresubreddits, /r/SubredditHub, /r/ShamelessPlug

And it's not entirely their fault, they don't have the right tools and sometimes they simply have to deal with more important matter. And as far as I can see, the tagging tool is not a mass ban tool. The only thing I've seen is mods stating that it's one of many things that helps them decide whether somebody should get banned to keep their subreddit peaceful or not. Is it a perfect tool? Certainly not. But it's kind of a desperate measure to the problems that arise with having such a huge accumulation of people and the fact that some people decide to use the platform to make others feel bad.

>those are also very poorly defined.

They don't have to be, and at a fundamental level, many of them aren't. That's part of what I'm saying. We / the admins have the power to decide where that line is. We can say ""This is what sexism looks like to us and this is what won't be tolerated."" If people don't like where that line ends up, the cool thing is that they can leave and go somewhere else.

>Because you could definitely make an argument that a lot of those things are racist or sexist or hateful. But if you were to ban them from reddit, you'd lose a lot of diversity, and a lot of valuable, interesting, multifaceted discussions.

This is my entire point, actually, and I'm glad you put it like this. My experience is that on this site, it is very difficult to have *precisely* this kind of nuanced conversation if you're starting from ground zero every time. 

Because when you're having these interesting conversations about where lines are, or gray areas, and things like that, and people derail those conversations with *fundamental* questions that have been answered dozens of times and from which the discussions in question have evolved... you lose something. It isn't productive.

I'm going to put it in the lens of feminism again, because that's where a lot of my experience on this site comes from. When you're having a discussion with people which rests upon, for example, the supposition that the patriarchy is a thing that exists, it's very hard to have that kind of conversation when people who are inexperienced and vocal about their ignorance come in with things like ""THE PATRIARCHY ISN'T REAL AND FEMINISTS HATE MEN"" It's like yeah, that conversation has been had over and over again, and you should go have it somewhere else if you want to fight about it. Educate yourself or take it elsewhere.

Blow that up to the macro scale of Reddit and that's what I'm talking about when I say that ""not all conversation is valuable.""

What I'm saying is that I think it's absolutely fine, and would in fact be helpful, to say that a certain baseline level of ""discussion"" needs to happen elsewhere, that Reddit is not interested in facilitating or perpetuating.

I'm not saying ""ban everything"", I'm saying that the lines of what Reddit does and does not tolerate can be shifted a little bit at this point, and Reddit would be better off for it.

Obviously someone has to put a line on that ""baseline"" but the cool thing about Reddit is that it's just a website, and if the admins put the line somewhere you don't like, great, go somewhere else to exercise your free speech.",False,False,False,124044,2021,1284504659.0,False,False

That's a valuable thing, and it's not as simple as replacing reddit. You can take the code but you can't take the community. But I think there's a very different scale comparing sites to countries. I can start my own site if I get banned from another, and it's just as accessible as any other website. Sure, I won't have the built in audience, but that's the marketplace of ideas for you. If what I say resonates, people will find it no matter what domain name it is. 

>If all the people you label as having ""horrible ideas"" just go somewhere else and hivemind, do you really think that'll go well? I think it's *much* better for them to stay here, where people can argue with them and everybody can refine their worldviews.

I firmly believe that a hive mind somewhere else is less harmful than one here. We're talking about places like coontown, there's nothing being refined there. This isn't a debate about the nature of race in society, it's a debate about whether black people are humans or animals. No one is going to change their minds. It's not a debate worth having. It's not like there are interesting new points to be made. But, by giving them a platform on reddit instead of an obscure racist forum somewhere else, they gain legitimacy. They gain the ability to curate a front page for themselves that makes racism look normal. They get to see some racism, and then immediately jump to a video of a black person in one of the default subs where they can take a steaming pile of shit in the comments. And if it's not overt enough, it'll be upvoted by fellow racists, or people who don't hear the dog whistle or think it's funny. The ensuing debate will mention a racist sub and give it some nice free advertising. Checking out another subreddit is lower friction that another site entirely. The controversy over such horrible racism on such a popular site gives them advertising too. None of this stuff happens with sites like Stormfront, at least not nearly to this degree, it's unique to the way reddit works. 

And now we're at the point where reddit has a reputation for this stuff, which keeps people with other viewpoints away. We can have a site where black people and women feel comfortable, or we can have one where racists and sexists do. We can't have both. There isn't enough isolation between communities to do that, even with the new quarantining. By banning the worst racist subs, we lose racists but gain the people those racists were keeping away. That's going to result in better discussion, the exact opposite of a chilling effect, because the discussion the racists want to have has been done many times before.

I could understand punishing a user with a demonstrated history of using hateful words to troll for reactions, even though I'm still inclined to trust the community and the structure of the voting system to deal with those comments, but I'm going to remain firmly against punishing these comments on a case by case basis. 

I know I've personally been accused of making racist comments on this site against a minority group to which I belong (hard to tell, our user names are all blue), and the particular comment I'm thinking of was not hateful, nor could it have even been perceived as hateful when taken in the context of the entire post.  It was actually supportive, and included a link to peer reviewed science as a source.  Anecdotal, I know, but relevant to the conversation.  All it takes is for one person to read it the wrong way (or pick a few words out of the center of a sentence) and I lose an years old account if you let that policy go through.  If Bill the Admin arrives at his hate speech moderation queue in a sour mood and reads the few words in the middle of a sentence that when isolated from the words before or after make a terrible sentence, boom, ban.

Or in another hypothetical case, let's say a level headed person who was raised in a small southern US town has always just accepted some racist idea as a matter of fact.  He arrives in a subreddit where somebody is refuting that idea, and he makes a comment consisting of what he believes to be innocuous fact, but others construe it as hate speech.  In one universe, he engages in the conversation where by the end he realizes his assessment of the facts were wrong and his mind is opened however more slightly (this really does happen sometimes, I promise).  In another universe, his first comment is reported and deleted and he's banned, never having reached the conclusion that his assessment of the fact was wrong.  He goes about his daily life with 60+ year old ideas about differences between races.

The same way that we can pray the gay away? Peoples sexual preference doesn't work that way.

There is in my mind only solution to being unfortunate enough to be born a pedophile, and that is chemical castration.

And if those copyright holders pursue them for it, imgur would quickly oblige in taking the images down, in all likelihood. Personal pursuit of copyright protection is a key component of copyright legislation.

Which they had every right to do, and FPH circumvented their takedowns of their copyrighted images.

I don't doubt that FPH got the attention they had because of how they were violating copyright and their harassment. That's often how human-administered policy works.

>Do you really think people are going to openly discuss illegal activity on coontown where they know they're being watched? No. they'll just take it to those private spaces.

I'm sure it still *helps* having the discussions which then lead to the illegal stuff in an open place. I also vaguely remember stories of a Brazilian drug cartel conducting operations on a small sub, and reddit left it open so the FBI could track it more easily - I could be confused on that, though; it's a vague memory. You *might* be overestimating some folks' intelligence.

>It's not like we don't have enough examples of racism already. There are reams and reams of shitty racist opinions that have been spewed. If you want, archive all of coontown's contents as some kind of library of shit. Nothing of value is being added by allowing them to continue.

I'm certain that, even among such backwards ideas and communities, new ideas come up now and again. No group is *completely* stagnant.

>You think people's opinions are more likely to change in a racist echo chamber than outside of it? This makes literally 0 sense. The only community they have is being a bunch of racist assholes, which is not one worth having.

It's *possible*, but yeah, it's definitely a longshot. I think it'd be more likely that a few folks might be convinced by people coming in from elsewhere on reddit. We're not as echo-chamber-y since subs are part of a larger site. (the ""quarantine"" idea would exacerbate that, though I still think it's a great idea)

>People still have the freedom to run their own shitty racist websites and have their shitty racist clubs and be racist in their own homes.

Absolutely.

>What you're essentially saying is that nobody should ever be prevented from venting whatever opinions they have in whatever context.

Absolutely not. You're taking my views on reddit in particular and generalizing them to every context ever, and that's not accurate. reddit, specifically, was founded as a place where the idea of free speech would be a high priority, and I'm glad that the admins are finding ways to still uphold that while also making good business decisions. I absolutely wouldn't expect other organizations to take the same actions if they didn't have the same founding principles. Heck, I wasn't sure reddit would keep to those founding principles, and I wouldn't blame them if they 180'd on it; I'd be disappointed, but I wouldn't be *angry*, as long as they were fairly honest about it.

>This is not one of those times. The views of /r/coontown subscribers are definitely wrong.

I agree with you, but I disagree that it means they shouldn't be able to talk about it anyway or that no good can come of them doing so, and I disagree with the idea that this site should be anything other than what the folks running it want it to be, and if they want to provide a space for those folks to talk about those things, I won't yell at them for doing so.

>Should all biologists be forced to read the opinions of young-earth creationists and anti-evolutionists? Should doctors be made to learn about crystal healing and homeopathy because ""hey man, it's good to be exposed to ideas you disagree with!""? 

Never said anyone should be forced to it - I'm saying folks should have the opportunity if they want it. There was a time when prevailing medical opinion was that acupuncture and chiropractic ^(why is it ""chiropractic"" and not ""chiropracty""? ugh) were complete bunk, but that's changed, specifically because some folks who were interested sought out those they thought held invalid views and engaged them and found that there was some validity to those views after all. 

>No. Those arguments are over and to continue them only gives credence to disproven and outmoded ideas. 

I don't see how letting someone continue saying nonsense somehow gives that nonsense meaning.

>Most of society has moved on from the ideas expressed by /r/coontown[2] too. There is no longer anything to be gained from their discussion. 

I don't think what gets discussed in /r/coontown will lead to anything especially productive, but I'm willing to leave the door open for it to happen in spite of my low expectations. Especially since they *will* have those discussions elsewhere if they don't have them on reddit, so not allowing them to have them here doesn't really accomplish anything. I don't see much downside (again, assuming the quarantine idea goes through), and while there is *little* potential for upside, there *is* potential. No reason to throw that away.

And that's a problem - which is why I rather like the ""quarantine"" idea /u/spez proposed.

>By providing a community for these hateful groups to gather on, reddit is encouraging the spread of these ideas.

I don't agree that providing a space for people to talk about something necessarily encourages the spread of those ideas or endorses or supports it. It's not like kicking them off reddit will prevent them from talking about it.

>Many of these subreddits are also active in vote brigading and spamming other subreddits.

And that is also a problem, which /u/spez said they're working on, and I'm very glad to hear it.

> There's nothing stopping them from creating their own forum elsewhere on the internet, but reddit should not endorse them.

I disagree that reddit permitting them to be here is somehow endorsing them.

>Encouraging the spread of hate by giving these people a place to congregate on a site that claims to be the ""front page of the internet"" is silencing and oppressing minorities because you are validating the opinions of bigots and sociopaths.

**Allowing someone else to talk does not in any way prevent anyone else from also talking.** I hate that idea. The proper response to speech you disagree with is *more speech* - you can talk louder than them; you can engage with them to try and show them how they're wrong and you're right; you can make an example of them and show *others* how they're wrong and you're right; etc. Silencing their speech is the wrong approach.

Someone talking about how they hate gays does not in any way prevent someone else talking about how they love gays or how they are gay. Just think of the logistics - think of literal speech. You talking doesn't prevent me from also talking at the same time. (Doing so means we probably won't be *listening* to each other, but the idea is a right to *speak* not a right to be *heard*.) And allowing someone to say something does not in any way validate or endorse or approve of what they say - this is, for example, why politicians are supposed to explicitly endorse the messages they put out while campaigning, because simply allowing it to happen is not the same as endorsing it. (Whether or not they actually do that as they should is a whole other issue.)

Would you rather they congregate in a true echo-chamber, a closed forum where no one is allowed to speak except to agree with what they say? Wouldn't that be *more* validating than having the occasional open discussion where people call them out for being bigoted sociopaths and expressing why, exactly, that is a bad thing?

The proper solution here is *more* speech, not less.

>If their word is law only in the subreddit, then admins shouldn't be approving sitewide shadowbans per the request of a mod from a single subreddit.

Why not? If that mod of a single subreddit shows a user breaking a sitewide rule? Sitewide doesn't mean they're breaking it in multiple places, it means that it's an overarching rule that applies to the entire website. You can break it once, in one comment, on one subreddit, and that's enough. 

>Mods are submitting people for shadowbans based on no sitewide rules being broken and people are being shadowbanned

No, no they are not. No one is being shadowbanned for no reason. I hate to be ""that guy"" and say the famous phrase, but show me the evidence. The admins are employees, working under contract with reddit inc, if they are not operating according to company policy then they get fired. They're not going to risk that.

Sometimes, though, harassment isn't as clear cut and sometimes people take things as harassment that to others are not. That's part of the problem too. That's why Reddit needs a clear policy on harassment. 

As to whether or not the tool is a mass ban item - it can be used to build one. It could be used to plug in all of those names into automod and use automod's subreddit specific shadowban function (not a real shadowban, but automod has a feature that bans that person silently from that sub/removes their posts/does not allow them to post or whatnot). Which is exactly why I'm saying that it is a bad idea. It is a group of usernames that can very, very easily be taken and used for purposes that are shitty. 

Grouping people up in the way that they have is also very disingenuous. It groups KiA and MensRights with Coontown when they are NOTHING alike. It throws in commenters and submitters even if they've submitted AGAINST the POV of the sub. It also seems to randomly link to a submitted comment or post, even if there are previous ones, or ones after that. It takes one small sample and paints a broad picture that is inherently flawed.

If it is just a tool, it should be cool for any group to make a list of another group and to pass it around to users for them to install and then use - because what's the harm? It isn't like users do shitty things sometimes, right? 

If the issue is admins not doing what you need, contact them. Work with them. Make direct needs understood.

I think this may be the crux of the issue. Because I don't think that's true at all. I think we *can* have both. In many ways, we *do* have both.

I'm a bisexual female of color and I feel comfortable on reddit. In fact, I feel more comfortable on reddit than I have on pretty much any other social media site. I feel comfortable *because* I can have conversations like this one, where we can discuss complicated issues in totally civil tones and come to more nuanced conclusions as a result. I have not seen that on any other site, tbh.

I used to spend time on tumblr, but the identity politics so popular there became incredibly stifling, uncomfortable, and legitimately dangerous in some cases, to the point where I couldn't log on without holding my breath and crossing my fingers there was no hate or abuse on my dashboard: hate and abuse predicated on the assumption that the people being abused *deserved* it, because they were somehow racist or sexist, based purely on the definitions of the abusers. I saw people pressured to separate themselves from their families, harass their own friends, and repudiate their own gender identities because these things were inherently ""oppressive.""

I left and came here. It's been a breath of fresh air. Despite being a woman of color, nobody has sent me any harassing messages. In fact, I haven't even read any tirades about how women and people of color are ruining America. Not even on the default subs.

I'm sure those things exist, but *I don't seek them out.* And just as those things may exist, there are plenty of discussions of how to stop institutionalized racism in America. There are discussions of how to reconcile the bloody history that founded our country with the diversity it now holds. There are discussions of transgender visibility. There are posts celebrating record-breaking female athletes. *All* of these things exist on reddit, and I can read what I want, and participate where I want.

That's amazing, to me. That's glorious and that's exactly the kind of community I want to foster. I do not actually want a community where only the topics curated by admins and determined to be *palatable* to a wide audience can exist. I want a community where *everything* can exist, and I can decide what I find palatable. I don't want anybody else deciding that for me.

> Checking out another subreddit is lower friction that another site entirely.

Yes they must. Otherwise you can't pin it on /r/coontown. Or do you actually think i can blame /r/SRS for your shitty comments?

There are not even comparable. Those people are going onto a specific subreddit to make fun of black people and spam the subreddit with hate, but all I'm doing is replying to your comment. I wasn't linked to this thread. I came here on my own.

Because they're not going to be banned. Subs quarantined will be forcibly opted out of /r/all, searches, etc and unviewable to anyone without an account and/or anyone who hasn't opted in to see said content.

> Isn't the point of a quarantine to keep a disease immobilized and neutralized? Would you let someone infected by one wander out of the area without notifying other people?

They're still reddit users and reddit itself is under no obligation to start branding people based on the content they view. Should they tag you with a ""SJW"" label? I'm sure you don't view that term favorably either (and before you say anything, I'm not arguing the merits of it, just trying to make a point). There's a reason these things aren't done. They promote distrust and hostility among users. That's no good and it's how we get stupid shit like the Boston Bombing debacle where reddit basically condemned an innocent man. When your witch hunts are wrong, you're perpetrating the very harassment you claim to hate them so much for.

Also, I'd like to point out that the original question above was about whether or not opting in to SEE the content would tag you.

To figure out if you're shadowbanned, the best way is to log out and see if your posts/comments are showing up. However, there is also a subreddit (/r/amishadowbanned, I believe) where you can post and will be notified if you have been shadowbanned or not.",False,False,False,32096,6982,1334352824.0,False,True

These are mostly spammers, but also those who engage in vote manipulation, or vote in subreddits after being redirected there from somewhere else. This is done to ensure that ""smaller"" communities have their own place to discuss the things they like, without being bothered by other groups.

Meaning that MyLittlePony fans shouldn't be made fun of or downvoted in their own subreddit by those who end up there because a news site or a different subreddit links to a post in /r/mylittlepony. 

This doesn't just apply to /r/mylittlepony, but also /r/blackladies, /r/timberframe and /r/afrobeat and more controversially but just as important, the racist as fuck, /r/CoonTown. Now I don't necessarily believe hate speech needs to be harbored by Reddit. But they do need to enforce their site rules in **all** their subreddits.

If you spam, or do what I described above, or try and bypass subreddit bans by using alternate accounts, you'll get shadowbanned. At first glance, nothing really seems to be different to you, you can still post comments, and upvote/downvote submissions and comments, but people stop replying to your comments.

They're not replying to your comments because they can not see them. While everything still looks fine on your end, nobody can see your comments. Your votes don't do anything. Reddit tricked you. They want you to think you can still Reddit normally, because as long as you don't know your spam messages/votes aren't coming through, you won't make another account or look for a solution to that problem.

[Take a look at this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/cjam1dc), this is a pretty famous shadowban case. Unidan was banned for vote manipulation, using 5 puppet accounts to upvote his own posts, and downvote those who he thought were teaching incorrect facts, so he had more visibility among them. /u/Unidan is his userpage, as you can see, his userpage does not exist. If Unidan were to log into Reddit and visits his userpage, it still exists for him, meaning that he sees all his old comments.

So all you need to do to see if you're shadowbanned, is visit your own userpage while not logged in. A quick way to do this in Chrome, is to right-click your own username and open the link in an incognito window.

**tl;dr**, shadowbanning is Reddit's way of segregating you from the rest of the people on the site without you knowing it, by breaking Reddit Site rules, you can visit your own userpage while not being logged into Reddit to check whether you're shadowbanned or not.

Look. Free Speech *is it's own argument*. And sometimes - often - people use that speech to be mean, or just say things that aren't 'nice'. 

*""I'm beautiful, I can wear a bikini, and I don't care about conventional body attitudes!""*

Sure thing. Your right to put that opinion out there. Some people might support you. Others are going to point out that you're not that good looking, you're *fat*, and for the love of god, you don't need to be wearing a bikini in public. Also, you're unhealthy.

Some of them will be nice, maybe try to be helpful: ""Hey, I was fat and I found doing X and Y helped me lose weight, and now I feel much better and people are nicer to me"".

Other people are going to sneer and call you a 'butter golem' and make some frankly nasty jokes at your expense. 

""That's bullying! That's shaming! *My feelings are hurt!*""

Maybe? Probably. And that's too bad, but thems the breaks.

Okay, away from the fat people wanting to pretend they're healthy. 

Politics. Everybody has an opinion. Including myself. I'm (for the most part) a fairly liberal guy. I have a *massive* chip on my shoulder regarding MBAs and conservative businessmen. My take is they're very often evil people, serving themselves at the direct expense of everyone else. They're *bad people*, and personally, I would love to see these tax-dodging thieves bought low and made to answer to the poor and working people they've gleefully kicked around and called 'takers'.

Some people think I'm an idiot. I've been called out here and elsewhere. I've been called rude names and a few times I've had my parentage called into question.

There have been a few times people have just gotten MEAN, because they think I'm wrong, they think I 'want something for nothing' or I'm lazy and hate rich people purely out of jealousy. I got called names. I've been dismissed. 

Because I expressed my opinion. And sometimes I'm not nice about it. Sometimes, I have it coming. 

Maybe my feelings got a little hurt if I thought I'd made a good point! But I stood up in a public forum and I let 'er rip. Somewhere, maybe there's a nice person who worked their ass off and got an MBA and saw my post and thought *""Screw you, I worked hard and I'm not a horrible person, you're making assumptions!""*. Maybe they replied, and called me out. Maybe *their* feelings got hurt.

The point is, that's life. That's free speech. Sometimes people get mean, sometimes it gets personal, *particularly* when everyone's behind their keyboards.

The problem is when one side decides their feelings - their egos - are more precious that others and that those things are worth more than speech and tries to silence everyone save for the people who agree with them. The idea seems to be 'people will get along better if we moderate speech and not let people say things like ""conservatives/liberals are idiots (or using names like 'libtard'"" or ""no, jackwagon, you need to stop eating coke and McDonalds and loose weight, stop claiming you're somehow a victim when you can't fit in an airliner chair'"".

Free speech can be hurtful. Shocker! Censoring all but the most egregious examples, though, won't make the world a better place.

Free speech is just that. The free exchange of ideas and feelings. Sometimes it's constructive. Sometimes it's just highly evolved monkeys throwing digital feces at one another behind a mask of anonymity. 

Look at Tumblr. *Jesus, look at it*. Morbidly obese people calling themselves 'athletes' with straight faces, telling themselves they're *healthy at any size*, while that's VERY obviously NOT the case. 

People coming up with 'head mates' and pretending they're 'dragons' and have 'astral wings'. All in a mostly sealed bubble of honestly screwed up people just like them, or at least others playing along.

Does Tumblr look happy? *Hell* no, they're angry and often shocked and offended when they step outside that bubble and find most people see fat people as gross or lazy, or laugh at / back slowly away from someone when they start talking about how they're *really* a flying cat-dragon-thing with their own sexuality and gender pronouns. 

Welcome to the real world! It can be rough, but that's not always a bad thing.

Look. I know bullying can be a shitty, shitty, shitshow. I was bullied in school because I was the awkward quiet kid that sucked at interacting with people. I got my feelings hurt, got called names. I got my ass tossed around a few times and I didn't deserve it.

I had to buck up a bit. Some of the bullying just hurt, others made me look at myself and make adjustments. This is how society works. Protecting people from contrary or potentially hurtful speech or concepts *they personally find distasteful* in the long run only serves to insulate people who might need a sometimes rude wake up call to the real world outside their bubble. 

For the *really* mean people - the trolls - it only makes them worse. Like putting a lid on a boiling pot; you've stopped the steam for the moment but when it breaks loose it's going to be bad. *And it will escape*.

""Calling the free speech argument"" can be a concession. The thing is - if 'your best argument for your opinion is that it's not really illegal', people will see that, and sometimes slowly - sometimes quickly - it'll be called out. Might start a debate. Might just get you banned or have your feelings hurt.

The alternative is censoring everything so *no one* gets their fee fees hurt. And that's not, honestly, a world anyone - even the SJWs, though they might not believe it - wants to live in.",False,False,1438201012.0,57109,704,1327325140.0,False,False

There's a difference between jokes about race and being racist. It's not even a very subtle one. Jokes about race are jokes in which race is an element. Being racist is when your joke is clearly attacking a group of people for being the group of people they are. It's racist when the joke is just, ""black people! right?""

I believe SRSsucks has such a tool, [here it is](https://www.triggerwarning.tk.gridhosted.co.uk/) (found on their sidebar). *And I'm not saying KiA, SRSsucks, coontown, etc. are the same exact people.* (Although there are some cross sections.)  But yeah, it already happened. I feel pretty much the same about both tools, they're both very flawed and if you complain about them you're making a bigger thing out them than they are. I will admit though, I am biased when it comes to certain subreddits and some of their more extreme users. And whether the situation is that you have a bunch of trolls (because a lot of them must be trolls, I can't imagine anybody saying some of the things they say and being serious about them) telling women to get raped or mods who take it too far and just put anybody commenting in those subs in the same category and ban them, the people who decide to be assholes have won, the trolls have won. We discuss to death what to do with them, we get annoyed, we get angry, some people are scared. If mods go too far protecting their subs they get screamed at by other users, sometimes with very good reason. These are very deep issues on reddit and on the internet in general and really what we all should do in most cases is ignoring the trolls. That's the only thing that has worked ever. However look at me, I'm writing paragraphs about the pro and cons of providing tools against them.

> As to whether or not the tool is a mass ban item - it can be used to build one.

I can't say that it isn't *technically* possible. But what you said is already happening in a much more efficient way. I know of one sub that will ban anybody who has commented in certain subreddits automatically. Even though they say that you can appeal, your chances are very slim unless you stop participating in those subreddits. **But** from conversations I had with other mods many of them (including me) don't support that way of handling things *at all*, so I wouldn't say that list might be turned into a AutoMod shadowban master list. I know it's very common to mistrust moderators, but most of them really are just normal users in other subreddits they hang out in and I don't think they want to be treated that way in those subreddits either. And more importantly most of them are decent people who don't want to abuse their power. I don't think this gets said enough.

> If the issue is admins not doing what you need, contact them. 

Not sure if you're talking in general or about me specifically. But as I already said, I don't hold it against the admins, i.e. the community managers that some reports go un-adressed. I know they have a lot on their plate an they don't have the best tools to handle things. I also get a response when reporting stuff to them most of the time. There are no complaints from my side, but I can sympathize with some people who've showed me the kind of messages they get, and what I've seen admins say about it (I don't remember exactly what the context was, but basically somebody complained about harassment to an admin and they said it wasn't really harassment. That was before the new harassment policy though and of course there is a difference between somebody saying ""I hope you get raped"" and ""I know you live in xx, and I'll come there and rape and murder you"". Not to mention things that actually happen to people irl because they've upset someone on the internet.)

That's the logic. Now what might that look like when we blow it up to a Reddit scale? Those starting points get *much* more basic, *of course* since the audience is much less specific!

It's also a website for people who think black people are subhuman, that women are objects to be used and abused, and so forth. It *could* be just a website, *minus* those things and I'm arguing that it would be a lot better for it.

And yeah. It's a website. It's not a government. It's not dragging people into cells for opening their mouths. It's a great place for discussion and sharing of information. It would be **much greater** if it was all that with less bigotry, sexism, and racism.

They hate them for being offended at things, and for mocking the rest of reddit, and other stupid stuff like that. They invent these conspiracy theories where the admins are in bed with SRS and that SRS is somehow exempt from site rules. None of that is true, and that's what I argue against.

>Years after Sgt. John Spartan and Simon Phoenix are frozen, Dr. Cocteau  who is one of the same people who built the CryoPrison, creates what he believes the perfect society where crime is a virtually non-existent, and paternalistic society that forbids anything deemed unhealthy, including fatty foods and sexual intercourse. Even cursing is illegal: in one of the film's running gags, characters (typically Spartan) incur a fine each time he or she swears. Also tobacco products and alcohol are illegal. All part of his personal dream he then calls the ""Cocteau Plan"". With this plan, he's able to began what became San Angeles, a clean and pacific version of what used to be the city of L.A. in California as well.

Oh, which fallacy was that.... Straw man? The fallacy fallacy? I'm not sure.

I don't believe discussing the common topic in your sub counts as harassment, regardless of how mean it may be. Since both instances you gave were contained within the sub, they are not considered harassment.

I really don't see any vote brigading going on in your examples. Can you clarify?

> If we have evidence of them doing it once, then I'd bet money that this was a regular occurrence, we just can't see it yet.

Look! Another fallacy! This is the composition/division one, where you generalize the actions (or presumed actions) of a minority and place that bias on the rest of the group. It's a sort of parallel to sexist stereotypes.

Wikipedia: ""Governments, private organizations and individuals may engage in censorship.""

ACLU: ""Censorship, the suppression of words, images, or ideas that are ""offensive,"" happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others. Censorship can be carried out by the government as well as private pressure groups. ""

Merriam Webster: ""a person who supervises conduct and morals: as
a :  an official who examines materials (as publications or films) for objectionable matter""

Ergo, censorship.

It's taking place at Cambridge University, full of eager young students, almost all white, who've come to see some lively discussion, some revolutionary ideas that might lift them out of academic ennui, maybe some interpersonal drama that might fuel gossip or entertaining anecdotes in the days to come. Here James Baldwin debates William Buckley, Baldwin is the sole black person in the room from what we can see, and he is there to convince the crowd of his ideas, one of which is that black people are equal to white people. Buckley is there to convince the room of his opinions, particularly that segregation was a good thing, or at least, a necessary evil. While Baldwin, one of the foremost authors of his generation, soundly trounces him, I want you to consider: For a minority, they're James Baldwin at Cambridge college several times in their lives. And many of them (indeed most of them) are nowhere close to his level of eloquence.

So it's okay to say terrible things about Christians, but not Muslims? Fine to say that straight people are scum, but not gay people? Perfectly acceptable to tell white folks that they don't deserve to live and should be raped every day of their lives, but not black people?

Doesn't that seem like a bit of a double standard that should be avoided? Couldn't someone abuse that by baiting it or encouraging it and then saying ""gotcha!""?

Also, is it okay to simply say such things to people *without* mentioning any particular group to which they belong? Does that somehow make that speech become acceptable, for legal purposes?

What about friends joking with each other, fully understanding that it's not meant to be harmful? Does that now get opened to criminal penalties as well? If not, how exactly are we distinguishing between the same words said in different tones, and who decides what's okay and what's not?

That's understandable. But there's no such thing as ""bad guys,"" only bad behaviors (which can be changed), and there's also basically no such thing as someone who isn't racist - even anti-racists like me are still plenty racist (though we may try not to be).

This whole paragraph is idiotic.  Of course there are ""bad guys"".  There are bad people all over the place.  Plenty of racists are bad people.  Plenty of racists are just ignorant but good people.  That doesn't matter anyway, because telling a racist joke does not make that person a racist.  

Being a racist means that you have and show the belief that one race is inferior to another.  Personally, I absolutely think that people are inferior to other people, but there is not a single solitary thought in my head that someone's skin color has anything to do with that.  I'm going to guess that you don't think that whites are superior to blacks either.  If you don't think that one race is superior to another then you aren't a racist.  

Using racial stereotypes for humor's sake is not in and of itself racist.  You're racist if you believe that the Irish are inferior to other races solely because they are Irish.  There is a stereotype that Irish are drunks.  If you tell a joke about a drunk Irishman, then that doesn't make you a racist anymore than quoting the Bible makes you a Christian.

And...well, racism isn't settled. Obviously, given how much racism there still is in our society. Most people have, as a whole, decided that ""racism is wrong"" but nobody seems to agree on what exactly racism *is.* Some people think it's saying n*****, some people think it's cops killing black kids, some people think it's trying to wear your hair in dreadlocks, some people think it's asking for Obama's birth certificate, and some people think it's asking brown-skinned folks where they're from. And it's not super obvious to everybody what is ""reasonable"" and what is ""unacceptable"" according to common decency. Common decency is, well, not so common. So how are you going to define what is racist enough to ban?

If it were simply ""society at large will decide which subreddits to ban!"" that would be one thing. Very strange, and difficult to enforce, but still entirely different from what's happening here. The discussion here was about allowing a small team of administrators to decide what is acceptable content on reddit. Which a large percentage of users are extremely wary about, imo for good reason. Even ""well-meaning"" censorship has a whole lot of potential for abuse when all the power is in a few hands.

But yeah, you're right that neither coontown nor SRS are really designed to promote more than one point of view. But I don't think deleting them would help promote free discussion, either.

Ah, I see what you're saying. I think it's way more complicated than it sounds, though, so much so as to be unfeasible.

It would be a lot easier to enforce something like this if every racist or coontown-like post started with something concrete and identifiable like ""I think black people are subhuman! Let's talk about it!"" But...they don't. It's usually not that clear-cut.

Usually it's more like, ""hey I saw a black person the other day and *can you believe* how fat she was? how dare all those black people take our food stamps when they obviously don't need it!"" Now there's plenty wrong with that statement in *my* opinion, but it doesn't say anywhere that black people are subhuman. So are you gonna ban it?

If not: good, but that's like the majority of posts on coontown and other controversial subreddits.

If yes: how exactly are you defining why this is unacceptable? Does it just set off your visceral racism sensors?

>Not seen a single peace of evidence that shows that /r/coontown[1] brigades.
Because, you know what? If they did, they would have been banned together with /r/FPH[2] . But they weren't banned.

First of all it's piece, not peace. Lol. 

Second of all, ""/r/Rapingwomen wasn't banned when /r/GreatApes was, so that means it isn't a bad subreddit, right?""

>Naturally, i mean you already have proven that you can't read that well. What was i thinking, my little one.

Dat superiority complex doe.

>**All i can see is that user posting racist stuff**. 

THAT... IS... THE... POINT...

>Tell me, where is the brigade?

http://i.lvme.me/25hhabl.jpg

>Actually that user submitted ONE link to reddit. And that was to /r/funny[3] .

If you actually looked, it will show you how he posts to GreatApes and most likely moved to another account to continue being racist.

In this case, though—are the racists Luke Skywalker or the Death Star? It looks like they're the rebel alliance here, which is kinda weird. But if so, certainly the ""racist alliance"" would need to amass as much power as Luke Skywalker and friends, and be able to infiltrate the Galactic Empire's central headquarters. Reddit doesn't really have a central headquarters, unless you're talking about the admin team, which doesn't look like it'll be overrun with racists anytime soon. So it's highly doubtful a few stray folks with extreme racist opinions are gonna destroy reddit. I've seen no indication that's happening, other than people claiming it's gonna happen. Reddit's been a perfectly happy and comfortable place for me and thousands of other users, who manage to go about our lives without getting harassed by bigots.

But deleting racist subreddits because you're *embarrassed* is not at all the same thing as deleting them because you want to *protect* me, as a person of color.

I don't support deleting dissenting opinion, no matter how bad, because you're embarrassed about it. And if you're deleting it to protect me—I don't want to be protected!

You're jumping the gun here a bit. The discussion at large about hate speech revolves to some extent around what exactly should be defined *as* hate speech.

I don't think that saying ""I don't like gay people"" is hate speech. It's not nice, and it's not a preference I respect, but it's not hateful, and it doesn't encourage or incite violence or discrimination. I can say ""I don't like jocks"" without subtly implying that I want them all extirpated, and the same applies even if I'm expressing a racist or sexist or anti-gay view.

> It's also in no way a loss to society for it to be stifled

That particular speech? Perhaps not, but we're not talking about that *particular* speech. We're talking about how a system should be constructed. In practice, hate speech laws do often end up being used to stifle speech that is very firmly in a grey area (which, coincidentally, is why the provision I mentioned was struck down). Laws like this are difficult to take back once they've been put into place, and the more abusive they are the greater the chilling effect on anyone who would complain about them.

I'm also uncomfortable with the way you gloss over the disproportionate nature of the punishment. Going to jail is a very serious penalty: In Canada, having a criminal record makes getting a job extremely difficult. Weigh that against the harm done by a comment like that (virtually none), and factor in the likelihood that someone could hold that opinion without being dangerous or hateful (again, dislike is not hate).

Does a person deserve to have their life ruined for that? Is it worth it to society, so that no protected minority should ever have to be faced with non-violent bigotry?

If it was ISPs banning people for certain viewpoints you'd have an argument, since people cannot create their own with any degree of ease. Hosting a forum, on the other hand, is not difficult, and there are hundreds or thousands of other places where people can voice their opinions in any way they'd like.

not entirely, they enforced rules about not linking to subreddits, censoring names and subreddits, they broke this only when someone engaged them. This was the case with sewing girl. 

All this was after ban, and mods were shadowbanned before, so they didn't give a shit anyway at that point. Also they were banned without any warning or explanation. Remember they banned /r/neofag ? What was wrong with them?

From your link: 

> Various alien land laws existed in over a dozen states before they were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in *1952.*

(emphasis mine - that was years before civil rights laws and especially changes to racist federal housing policies began turning things around for African-Americans.)

And anyway, I would never dispute that Asians were discriminated against, only that their was oppression was never as thorough as that arrayed against African-Americans. Moreover, the immigrant experience makes a huge difference in the experiences of people in America; immigrants tend to have more means than those who remain in their home countries, and they tend to have more drive in general in part because of the mindset that led them to uproot themselves and start over in a new country. The same can be said for Nigerian-Americans, who, despite having those *awful* African genetics (and more of them than American Blacks, who had quite a lot of miscegenation imposed on us back in the day), [have the highest educational attainment in the U.S. by percentage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_American#Education)

Those groups' experiences here are very different from those of the two worst off minority groups in America: African-Americans, who are descended from slaves who came to America by force and were largely deprived of opportunity for centuries; and Native Americans, who had their land stolen from them, were nearly exterminated, and were then isolated on lands that white people didn't want.

So, are we talking about specific insults that are (for example) racially charged, like the n word? Or are we talking about general insults directed at someone who belongs to a minority? **I probably should've asked earlier** (I guess I sort of was trying to do so with my first paragraph last post) **what exactly you're considering to be hate speech.** You're right that the point I was heading for there may be completely irrelevant, depending how you define hate speech.

>How many straight people have been beaten to death by gay people for being straight? Cis people by trans people? How regularly are American Christians the target of violent bigotry from American Muslims? Tell me about how black people have forced whites into ghettos and prisons. Show me the long history of women forcing men into positions of subjugation.

I don't need to, because none of that is hate speech. Those actions are already illegal (regardless of group membership). And as a result, most of that is fairly rare in this country - the biggest exception would be police brutality, and I would say that's got more to do with giving the wrong people scary amounts of power than it has to do with hate speech. (I know we *hear* more about such bad things happening, because of advances in technology and media; that doesn't mean more bad stuff is actually happening.)

>These laws don't focus on protecting majority groups because majority groups are already protected they are not being victimized on a regular basis by minorities.

Absolutely agreed on that.

>The inevitable shortcomings of the justice system are not a legitimate ground to not outlaw something harmful otherwise nothing would be outlawed because pretty much every crime is vulnerable to the problems of human error or bias in the legal system. You do your best to make it fair and just and you adjust it as necessary to maintain that ideal. 

Yes and no; you do have to weigh whether it may do more harm than good (and whenever someone's talking about making new exceptions to protected speech, that's pretty much the first thing I worry about), and flaws in the system absolutely should be taken into account when deciding that. Hell, that's why we have a bill of rights in the first place - because the system is flawed, and the folks setting things up realized we needed some fail-safes to prevent from doing more harm than good.

So while you're right that it's entirely possible to do good despite flaws in the system, I don't think you can just dismiss them out of hand. You have to take reasonable steps to try and minimize the problems that will arise because of the new laws; doing otherwise is horrendously irresponsible.

We seem to agree and disagree on things. I think this is one of those rare moments where a racial issues pops up and I'm discussing it with someone who has legitimate critical thinking skills.

Subsequently, I don't think I can change your view. Usually it's because someone is hard headed, but in this case it's because you've come to your own conclusions by thinking it through. There is certainly merit to the idea of such 'protection' being patronizing, and that is something in the back of my mind that goes on.

But protection is a large factor. White people who gather together to celebrate the deaths of black people and their own perceived superiority never ends well. They've destroyed cities here in America, and nations overseas over less. You're right that a few stray folks with extreme racist opinions won't destroy reddit. But that's not what we're dealing with.

In the end, I feel the removal of such communities should be an implicit notion. As /u/spez says, such communities remain because it's still in debate whether or not black people are human. It worries me. I can certainly take care of myself, but I also worry the constant harassment from coontown against my brothers and sisters might just be too much. It just wears and tears slowly. Sometimes people think that for a force to mean something, it has to be of a powerful stream like water from a fire hose. Those people underestimate that even a tiny spring can carve a mountain in half over time.

It's like they're the crick, and we're without a paddle. But the almighty admin gods could do something about it, but ol' spez has done nothing but advocate white supremacy. And what troubles me the most is how *inconsequential* this seems to people. To me it's not, but as I said I have a tendency to speculate. I worry a hundred years from now what's happening here is going to be written in history books. Especially given that in all of recorded history, we are in fact the most recorded of history. Ink and parchment is fine, but this is real digitally rendered set in silicone stone the beginning of humanity.

And we're walking into these history books to tell our great grandchildren that we're just fine and dandy with some of the most ugliest ideology since inbreeding. And that here and now, those in power of reddit have essentially began to fund a terrorist organization.

>The routine response that ""You have no rights on Reddit"" has never served any conversation that it has appeared in.

It totally does.  People act like reddit is a government building and that your constitutional rights have any bearing here.  They don't.  It's a private website, on private servers.  They can host or ban any content they want with impunity.  They can ban you right now for no reason and there's nothing you can do about it.  That's fact.  They are not withheld to any rules except the ones they make themselves.  As long as they aren't committing crimes they can do what they want.  Freedom of speech says **the government** can't infringe upon your rights.  Reddit is **not a state actor**.  Banning you is reddit exercising their rights.

>simply allowing something to exist on reddit doesn't grant anyone an audience, especially something like Coontown (no link because I refuse to link there) that you have to seek out to gain access to.

Coontown has thousands of subscribers.  They are each other's audience.  You are not entitled to a convenient platform, even if its an echo chamber.  

Your personal subreddit isn't the only thing you use reddit for.  You have an audience right now.  Thousands of people are reading this conversation.  If you post on any popular subreddit, you have an audience.  Your anecdote has nothing to do with the situation at hand.

>Allowing something to exist is not endorsing or condoning it.

If I let a racist live down the street from me, you're right, that's not an endorsement of that racist.  But if I let that racist live in my house rent free, that's going to raise some eyebrows.

That only makes sense if you assume that 1) the ""cretins"" actually engage in honest debate and 2) that the viewers are skilled, educated, and informed enough to identify the good and bad arguments. Neither of those are true. 

Stormfronters are the ultimate sophists; they have many well-worn strategies for copying the rhetoric and feel of scientific and popular credibility (gish galloping cherry picked ""sources"", brigading to upvote, using ""sciency"" language, responding to reasoned paragraphs with pithy one-liners, etc.) without the accompanying logical substance, to the extent that it would usually take a trained scientist and a huge amount of time to identify and properly explain their fallacies. The average bloke on /r/AdviceAnimals has no chance. Furthermore, it's inherently an uphill battle with them, because there is already a bias against minorities in society, and hatred against an out-group is a natural human inclination.

It's not hate speech to say a black person is an idiot, it is to say black people are inherently stupid or to say they're a stupid n***er. And even that's more likely to just get you clocked on the spot rather than prosecuted. Hate speech laws generally are used mostly for large scale public speech like writing a book about how gays are degenerate animals or a website devoted to defaming black people rather than interactions between individuals because as you yourself said on an individual basis a lot of the time the target just does not give a fuck. It's more about stopping hate groups from being formed because that's where the real danger is. 

Which brings me to your next point. No, those crimes are not hate speech themselves but they don't occur in a vacuum. They are a direct result of people buying into the views espoused in hate speech and acting against minorities based on them. Do you think people just decide that black people are subhuman or transgendered people are freaks all on their own? It's learned behaviour and the best way to combat a learned behaviour is to stop it being taught in this case by stifling hate speech. 

But doing nothing isn't a reasonable step to minimize the problems it's just doing nothing which is even worse when there is clearly a problem that the legal system isn't dealing with.

Heh, good luck. I am a big fan of using real life to inspire science fiction.

I appreciate you having such a well-thought-out conversation with me! It's clear that there are a lot of complex subtleties to this debate. People on either side tend to think that their opinion on the matter is the obvious conclusion, but still have a very hard time convincing each other of that. We probably aren't gonna convince each other to complete agreement, but at least we understand each other a bit better.

> Left alone among a sea of far more rational minds, whatever anger and confusion they have over racial issues would be tempered and cooled by reality and interaction with diverse people. Kept in their bubble, organized with others, as a whole become a force to be reckoned.

I think this is actually one of my arguments *for* not censoring them. Telling coontown users to go find somewhere else to gather is essentially forcing them into a bubble. Reddit is far less of a bubble, given how easy it is to go from one subreddit to another, and how many diverse communities there are on this site. A racist on coontown is far more likely to encounter non-racist arguments elsewhere on this site than someone on a separate forum created for the purpose of consolidating racist thought.

And while it's certainly possible that allowing racists (or sexists or other folks) to gather on reddit and speak their minds will lead to them going and doing harm somewhere, I think unless it's proven that coontown users are actually acting on their distasteful opinions in real life, lynching folks or similar, reddit doesn't have any concrete justification for shutting them down. Innocent until proven guilty, you know? Otherwise this is like pre-emptive censorship. There's already been so much debate about the idea of punishing people *before* they commit crimes, and the general consensus has been we can't allow that in a fair judicial system, as nice as it sounds.

Seriously, you think that a discussion of historical FACTS - laws that were on books for years that made it all but impossible for any but a tiny percentage of blacks (most descended from slaves who were manumitted by their slave master *fathers* and barely distinguishable from Europeans) and which directly enriched generations of white people - should be off limits in a discussion about race in this country?

Okay, so are we specifically outlawing mass publications (including on the web), or are we outlawing all such speech and relying on prosecutors to only enforce it against mass publications? I'd be far more comfortable with the former than the latter; too many examples of well-intended laws being taken to ridiculous and harmful extremes because of prosecutors not being quite so discretionary.

Either way (only mass pubs, or only enforcing on mass pubs), that does change things a decent bit. So again, thanks for clarifying.

I would *love* stats on what impact such laws have on reducing the amount of hate crime. I suspect it's very little, but I may well be wrong on that. As such, the rest of what I'm going to say is drawing on my personal experiences in life and what I've seen/read/heard in the media, which will obviously be biased, but it's all I've got. (Not up for intensive research today, heh.)

I think there are a couple loose categories we can place those who carry out the crimes you described into.

First are the folks who wind up going on a killing spree, typically resulting in their own death. These folks may well cite a manifesto of some kind as the basis for their actions, but they're usually suffering from underlying mental disorders which are the true source of their actions, and the exact thing they focus in on and obsess over isn't nearly as important as the disorder that's making them obsess over something to the point they're willing to seriously harm others for it. Even if you took away all hate speech, they'd find *something* to set them off, because it's the mental disorder that is the root cause, not the hate speech. I think anti-hate speech laws wouldn't have much, if any, impact on this group. (Improving our mental health industry, on the other hand, would work *wonders*, as would improving our societal understanding and approach to mental health disorders. But that's a whole other rant.)

Then you have your stereotypical gay bashings and the like. Group/minority membership absolutely plays a role in these, but there's still more to it than that. These are often crimes of opportunity - sometimes as simple as seeing someone acting gay, or a black guy on the wrong side of town, and jumping him immediately. Minority membership is certainly one of the primary factors here, though I'd also argue that any person/group willing to bash someone's head in for being gay has other problems that also need addressing beyond just their view of gay folks. I think most of this behavior is taught/learned in *person*, not by mass publications - the folks who hated me for being gay in the South (or would have if they'd known) generally didn't care what the Bible said; they just cared that I was different in a way they didn't understand and were taught to hate. Banning such publications might remove some of the justification, but not that much - we tend to be scared of what we don't know/understand, and it's easy for that fear to turn into anger, even if you don't belong to a religion/spend time on a website that encourages it.

Other times (still on gay bashings & such) it's primarily personal, and the minority membership just adds to it: ""That stupid fag insulted me and embarrassed me in front of my friends, and I'm gonna teach him a lesson."" You could replace ""stupid fag"" with ""that guy"" and it wouldn't be functionally different - the minority membership is just a mask for what's actually personal aggression. Banning publications will have next to nil effect here, since it's mostly personal anyway. I think this category can also include folks who adopt kids from overseas to keep as slaves (though banning publications *may* help keep people from knowing what to do and say to be successful at it - no ""train your housepet in 30 days"" manuals - there's still plenty of documentation on adoption and such for someone to piece it together, and I don't think lack of a centralized resource would actually stop anyone who wants to do this in the first place), because I don't think they really care about justifying their actions so much as they want free labor. Same goes for abusing and raping women of a certain group - often they just realize (consciously or not) that it's easier to get away with it if they target marginalized groups, and removing the minority membership from the equation doesn't solve the problem.

I *think* that pretty well covers what you were describing? By all means let me know.

So, in summary, I don't think the sort of laws you're suggesting would have a great impact on the crimes you're wanting to discourage - it may have some, but I don't think it'll be that much. So some positive benefit, but not a lot. (We can agree to disagree here if need be; after writing more below, I honestly don't think it'd matter much if it *were* a big benefit. I think we *can* agree that it wouldn't *completely* solve the problem, at least.)

Now let's look at the cons.

First one is obviously going to be religious texts (hinted at it earlier) - the three main monotheistic religions are by far the majority religions in the US, and all three of them have holy texts which contain blatant hate speech against homosexuals *and* those who don't follow that religion (death for the former, death/enslavement/enforced conversion for the latter). They also arguably have such material concerning women, trans-oriented folks, people of other races/cultures/geographical origins, and more. I don't know how you could possibly draft legislation that outlaws the publication of hate speech without outlawing the Bible & Koran, not to mention the statements of faith that the various Christian denominations use to distinguish themselves from one another, or the various publications discussing those beliefs that circulate. You could try and *only* ban the hate speech parts of these publications, but people are gonna get awfully mad about chopping parts out of their Bibles, and there's gonna be some awfully borderline parts. Some major denominations refuse to have women in any leadership position - does that qualify as hate speech? If so, you're taking away a significant aspect of many folks' belief system (no joke, I've seen churches split over whether or not my mom was allowed to be treasurer, or allowed to cast a vote on the board when acting as treasurer. It was idiotic, but I don't think it should be *illegal*.) Does it only count as hate speech if they explicitly say *why* they don't think women make capable leaders? 

Depending how strictly you define hate speech (and I'll admit I'm stretching here, but mostly because I *know* other would try and make this a legitimate point and that scares me), scientific research describing the average male's strength vs the average female's strength could likewise be construed as hate speech (""They're saying women are inferior to men!""). Same goes for risks for different illnesses and conditions (gays and blacks have massively higher risk of HIV; men have lower life expectancy than women; blacks have increased risk of heart disease; etc.). Your gender and your race are considered significant risk factors for **all sorts** of things. And we already have some folks claiming this is discrimination - we gays have been loudly protesting the restrictions on our blood donation for *ages*, even though statistically we *are* at a massively higher risk of HIV, and no one has the *right* to donate blood (which is why legal challenges to it haven't gotten anywhere, afaik).

Then there is the aspect of learning from past mistakes - how exactly can someone obtaining a racial justice degree or gender studies degree be expected to sufficiently learn their field of study if the most potent books and writings of their greatest enemies are banned? Sure, they could read a summary of Mein Kampf, but that's not going to have the same effect as reading the actual thing. Encountering opposing views is sometimes the best way to understand why you are opposed to those views. That's a pretty big component of a college education, actually; especially true for the humanities. (You could try and work in an education exemption here, but what about folks who want to study it on their own and not in a formal environment? How do you preserve the benefit of having them available without completely negating the benefit of *not* having them available? They're directly opposed.)

So you see, it's not just an arbitrary sanctity of free speech (though I can see why it may sound that way when I wasn't working with a better understanding of what you were supporting) - it's the very real consequences that restricting free speech can have, often in completely unintended and massively harmful directions. These are just three pretty significant problems (or two, if you discount the middle one, but I wouldn't) that I've come up with in... twenty minutes of typing a wall of text? And there's definitely going to be more than just that.

Perhaps that explains why I'm so adamantly opposed to a broad new restriction on free speech? I'm not going to pretend it's always the right choice for every country/culture (I hate when people do that with democracy; holds true for this as well), but I am going to state very firmly that it's the right thing for *this* country and culture, and staunchly oppose any attempts to broadly change that without a *very* thorough examination of the potential impact, for good and for bad. And I trust the body of law that has been established for centuries over here that such broad changes are almost universally not worth the cost, in addition to my own thoughts on how things could go.

I think white supremacy is bullshit too, but scientific racism hasn't been all that disproved yet, thanks to ethics getting in the way of doing some serious studies(i could come up with the IQ test results, but better education can also improve your results so it could be the reason why non whites/asians came on the lowest spots).
2. Of course absolutism means being uncivilized, that's what led to white supremacy. And i did say that ""if it does anything for you"" because most people assume i am a white male when i'm far from it.

3. First off, i spelled it as fenotipycal because that's pretty much the way it's spelled in my mother tongue. Told you that before and you're still using it against me, not knowing how to spell a word doesn't imply that i'm not versed in a topic, and the fact that this is a textbook fallacy, and that you fail to see it, tells me that either you're a bit upset or that you haven't been educated very well. 

4. Hey, how come i don't understand genetics? what makes size vary on dogs? a gene. On humans? a gene. Hair color? genes. Skin color? genes. Intelligence? genes. Want me to keep going? 
We are both animal species, and we not only can, but should be measured with the same tool, and that tool gives way to comparisons. We compare human behavior to chimpanzees, and that isn't wrong. How is it wrong then comparing races, another type of characteristic of a species, not as clearly present on chimps but present on dogs, which implies a noticeable differing  genetic makeup when compared to another specimen or group of them. 

5. It is completely plausible that someone in ShitRedditSays or Tumblr might go batshit insane and murder every white male on sight because of the things they read online about them. Radical feminism has exactly the same type of hive mind radicalization of people, as do many religions, and other types of movements. What do you advocate, banning all of reddit? Ban /r/Islam because there might be a terrorist in there? ban /r/atheism because there might be one of the school shooters? Heck, ban fucking /r/photography because there might be someone that might someday upload a creepshot of a minor. This isn't how the world works.

6. No i don't think black people are genetically inferior to anyone(i mean, if you are smarter than someone that doesn't mean you're better than them); i don't know if they are natural born criminals, but some people are born with mental diseases or tendencies to some things; Not all black men are thugs, and black women are not baboons; Yes, if you say something as straightforward as ""Given that Black people commit 56% of all robbery and 53% of all murder, despite being only 12% of the population(In the US) (Source:[FBI Crime in America 2013 Report](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43)), if you were to remove all black people from a mixed community crime would undoubtedly go down"" this is a true statement. there is no racism here. This is numbers. However, advocating murder for the sake of it, or not taking into account specific cases where black people where actually being the ones in the right is completely idiotic. So it all depends on whre you look.
7. You have to realize that you might not be right. They might be. That is the value of all the subreddits we consider distasteful.

If someone can get a new IP Lease from their ISP, then just as well, an innocent redditor in the same ISP and City/Town/IP-pool can get that ban message for no reason. Or you might have no clue what reddit is and make an account, their ban system seeing a IP they had trouble with in the past and blasting your account instantly for it (or instantly shadow banned due to ip relation to previous bans? Oooo) 

And depending on how the admins do it, existing users might get an unlucky IP for dhcp lease and boom their clean history account banned just for existing on that IP [this happens].

This would happen with people on TOR as well. Banned just for using it, because someone naughty also used it. And you just wanted network privacy.

Nothing is 100% safe and also easily deployed... But yes for all intents and purposes RSA is incredibly safe. Hence why the amount of stories relating to ""RSA broken again"" you hear is not in the 2048 ballpark.

As to that artical on the 4096 key.... At best that is due to a mis application of hardware, something that is exploitable now, but in future will be taken care of. Not relating to RSA, but rather to the leaking of classiflied information. Hence, mathematically speaking (my profession) the chances of RSA not being the go to option until quantum computing becomes a thing, is very very low.
Now, the issue is indeed, that we use RSA keys again and again, instead, in my opinion at least, keys and certificates should indeed start to have short expiry dates... But again, as computing power becomes more available, we can more easily generate keys and so reduce pattern matching attacks, such as the one you mention. Like you said, one time pad like system.

If black people are more likely to 1) be accused of crimes, 2) be convicted of crimes, and 3) be wrongfully accused/convicted of crimes than white people are for *those same types of crimes*, than statistics tell us nothing about the likelihood of an individual of committing a crime. I know it is surprising to you, but it means that the color of your skin has absolutely nothing to do with whether you will commit a crime.

Even if your statistic (which you didn't provide) does exist, it is skewed anyway because hardly any CEO's or executives are minorities because of, you guessed it, racial discrimination in the hiring and promotional process. Fewer sample size means you don't need many crimes to make up a larger proportion of those crimes when compared to the majority.

You can't take the same idea applied to a government and apply it to private businesses.  That's the antithesis of capitalism.  There's a reason the idea **only** applies to the government.  You can't force a private business to do that.  The whole notion of capitalism is that the government take as much of a hands off approach to private entities as possible.  What you're arguing for is essentially communism.

Example: for the longest time segregation was legal because of this very concept; that the government can't tell a private business who they can and cannot cater to, or what they must or must not allow.  And if you go back and read the supreme court cases that made segregation illegal, while the intent was good, the reasoning was constitutionally dubious as fuck and any lawyer will tell you that.

I, by no means, think Reddit is perfect. SRS should have been banned a long time ago. My point is in respect to the original comment. FPH was in violation of rules that were bannable offenses and would still be bannable offenses after the ability to hide offensive subs is introduced. The fact that they made a nuisance of themselves leading up to it and aren't in agreement with the Reddit hive mind is obviously why they garnered the attention for the ban, but it doesn't change the fact that they still committed bannable offenses, besides general in-sub harassment and being distasteful.

Honestly, though, if you want to make a case about banning SRS and can get them for a recent violation that their mods supported, I'm right behind you and will be in the comments there saying that the ban is legit. Hell, I'll do it for /r/funny and /r/pics as well, I don't care.

>Then by this standard FPH doing their bare minimum to ""censor"" people' identities there were targeting wasn't engaging in witch hunting either, but given how they couldn't keep their fingers out of other peoples' pie we see exactly how transparent this reasoning is. 

IRL identities like the Imgur staff, that's a totally different thing that is more in doxxing territory. RES tags aren't even close and by definition cannot affect anyone offsite. As I understand, doing that was FPH's last straw.

Yep. And if they want to, they can.

The ""harassment"" and ""witch-hunts"" are so exaggerated it isn't fair. I don't really care to argue anything ethical about FPH, but if you want any clarification feel free to ask.

Interesting fact; mods began to instantly ban people who would even suggest someone fat could be healthy or beautiful. This was taken as ridiculous (which is dumb to begin with, there's dozens of safe spots for fat people on the internet and reddit subs where saying fat is unhealthy or gross gets you banned instantly, this was the only sub where the inverse is true) When really mods banning these users **were actually protecting them**

That's right, people don't seem to get it. The same users would come into FPH and argue on multiple threads a day. It didn't lead to healthy discussion, it lead to FPH users stalking the dissenters and bothering them. Again, completely not encouraged by mods or within their rules, users would follow people arguing against FPH back to their subs and harass and post after their every comment. This doesn't have anything to do with how FPH was ran or moderated though, if anything the insta-ban on dissent only helped prevent people from painting massive targets on their back.

There are a lot of misunderstandings and false claims made about FPH, and this is a great example.

So you don't have any examples of reddit admins making any commitments to allowing unbarred free speech, and instead want to provide non-examples. Got it.

/r/FatPeopleHate definitely harassed users (and people off the site, for that matter), and there's plenty of evidence floating around  demonstrating as much, and that the mods did nothing to stop it when asked to do so.

There's no evidence that SRS does that currently, to my knowledge, and everything I've seen about the sub says that the mods follow the rules to the letter as part of their game.

The vast majority of things you listed that you think qualifies SRS as a hate group are opinions or actions. The term ""hate group"" refers to designated members of society, such as race, sex, sexual orientation, etc (generally things that can't be controlled or chosen, with religion as a notable exception). 

I don't know where you got your evidence that they advocate hating white people, men, or heterosexuals, but it seems fairly absurd, since I imagine that's what most of the users are (in line with the rest of the site). 

You also seemed to miss the fact that the subreddit is obvious satire. It's not particularly intelligent satire, but all the faux-vitriol is pretty clearly just users embracing the reputation they have on reddit.

I don't have to? Ask the admins to do that or something. Their stated reasons for banning the subreddit was harassment, so they presumably have evidence. They could be lying, sure, but if they were why would they not use the same lies to ban more heinous subreddits like /r/coontown?

Besides that, there are posts floating around that offer some (incomplete) evidence for harassment, [such as this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39c0n3/cmv_reddit_was_wrong_to_ban_rfatpeoplehate_but/cs27yt4?context=3).

How did I aid or abet them in any way? What? I've never posted there at any point. Is calling them an overblown boogeyman ""aiding and abetting"" now? You've also never told me how they're dangerous at any point, this is bizarre.

Even if you believe that some people faked some death threats, which AFAIK is the common claim, surely you believe that at least *some* of threats were real, given the rather extreme vitriol surrounding some of GamerGate's favorite people. Does that make GamerGate a ""militant, dangerous, very real hate group""? Are the admins aiding and abetting them? Are you?

I'm sure you disagree that it is, so why make SRS into the same boogeyman.

>How is demanding ethics, free speech, accountability, and non-entryism in any way hateful?

Pretending that a large portion of GamerGate serves as a ""lets hate on 'SJWs' platform is just silly. Everyone knows they do it. By your criteria for a hate group from your last comment, hating SJWs makes GamerGate and subs like KiA ""hate groups"". There are also plenty of arguments to be made that those subs have a strong negative bias towards women, transgendered individuals, and other minorities. Clearly those aren't the primary focus, but you can find examples in relative abundance.

>How is demanding ethics, free speech, accountability, and non-entryism in any way hateful?

Just because those are the stated goals doesn't mean it's all they do. By that logic, the stated goals of SRS are just to point out shitty comments made on reddit, so how is that in any way hateful? Clearly it's about the actual content posted by users. Just as you think SRS is hateful (in addition to pointing out shitty comments), others would claim that KiA is hateful (in addition to discussing gaming journalism and whatnot).

What else do Egypt and Ethiopia have that Nigeria and Congo don't? I'll give you a hint: a serious lack of what I would define as 'black' people. 

You're probably well aware of the state of Africa before colonization. I see no reason to expect that it would be any different after colonization. The idea that 'whites drew their borders wrong and taught them to hate each other' is largely a canard. I don't think some imaginary line in the dirt is going to stop the eternity of tribal warfare that blacks engage in where ever they're found.

I am not ignoring the statistics, I am explaining to you why they are wrong and misleading, and cherry-picked to push a hateful narrative. If you were capable of thinking for yourself or critically thinking about your views in the slightest you would realize that I have made several very good points that you just don't have an answer for, especially the biggest point, which is that racial profiling means that blacks are far more likely than whites to be stopped for ""crimes,"" charged, processed, prosecuted, and convicted, which skews the data. That means that they aren't committing more crimes, they are just dis-proportionally convicted of crimes that whites routinely get away with. They are also far more likely to be wrongfully convicted. That means all of your ""statistics,"" if not outright lies, are skewed *regardless of their accuracy.* Why is this so hard for you to grasp?

Think of it like this: lets say person A drives a brand new red corvette, and person b drives a minivan. Person A and B both drive 10 mph over the speed limit constantly. Person A gets 6 tickets in 2 years, while person b gets 1 ticket in the same time period. Would it be accurate to say that person A speeds more than person B? No, it wouldn't. What is really happening is Person A is just being stopped more because he drives a sports car, where person B doesn't get stopped as much because they drive a minivan. That's called profiling, and it is the reason that your stats are skewed.

I am being factual, and your example is way off base because you're talking about a whole different scale here.
