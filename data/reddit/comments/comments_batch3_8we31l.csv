Reddit is supposed to be a platform, a platform that you can interact with in many different ways (multiple web UIs targeted at desktop and mobile, apps, 3rd party stuff, etc).  You interact with it in whichever way works best for you, and that's a good thing because it's more useful for more people.  

As such, any new features like this should be device-neutral- able to be accessed from any device.  Otherwise (even in a beta test) you are screening out not only most of the users, but many demographics of users, from giving any feedback.  

I personally would love to try this but I almost exclusively browse Reddit through old.reddit.com (desktop) or i.reddit.com (mobile).  I also use an Android phone.  So I literally *cannot* try this feature.

Your posted criteria [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/e1244tv/) look good on the face of it.  However there are communities that fit those guidelines but also have an extreme bias one way or another, and (on a community/voting level) don't welcome or tolerate alternative viewpoints very much.  
I don't mind a community that has a slant one way or the other, as long as the community (both moderators and users) are tolerant of opposing ideas and are willing to engage in discussion without mass-downvoting well-thought-out but opposing posts.  If that is not the case, then such subreddits should not be included in news.  ",False,False,1529603869.0,418828,14673,1329528395.0,False,True

This is not entirely true. You solicited feedback from /r/Bitcoin mods on 3 separate occasions (4 separate occasions now, because OP just messaged us again soliciting more feedback.). We asked you each time for specifics on WHAT we should be reviewing (because there are no visible changes) and HOW news threads were being aggregated. On all 3 occasions we were completely ignored, and therefore were unable to provide any feedback at all. *Moderators have no indication whatsoever which posts are visible in the News section*, and it is unlikely that reddit admins have done enough to curate fake, clickbait, and plagiarist news domains.

We have set guidelines for the communities that filter into the experience, as well as the post type (for example: posts titles must reflect the article title). 

This isn't good enough. The problem with news sources and the internet in general lately is the overwhelming amount of biased, fake or exploitative articles and posts submitted online. This ranges from political beliefs, organisations paying for headlines and covert advertising all the way to simply segregating people into two different groups with opposing opinions. How are you / how have you dealt with this issue? What features are in place that will make Reddit a trustworthy news source and not a completely biased and manipulated one?

So far, from the .gif above, you've shown nothing other than a filter of sorts. This is barely a news tab but rather a ""categories"" tab and the implication that it is a source for news is just dangerous. Certain subreddits, some/one of which was/were displayed in the .gif, have natural biases that either link to or slightly modify articles that have a blatant preference in whatever it is they're reporting on. You can't guarantee the authenticity of a piece of 'news' either - who's to say that a manipulative post doesn't get a lot of attention, is shown on the News tab and then falsely feeds its browsers and lurkers information that is incorrect? Sure, the mods should be monitoring this stuff but if they link to an article and the headline is the same as the one in the Reddit post then they're not breaking any rules; now imagine that article and headline is now completely and utterly false and its objective is to push a narrative or promote discontent. 

You could've seriously used this as a new and effective tool that'd draw in more users whilst still going against the current trend of 'dangerous news' but instead you decided to follow other large sites such as Facebook and Twitter - both of which suffer severely from, and are the main offenders for, the exact 'dangerous news' I just mentioned. This could've become something like Elon Musk's idea called ""Pravda"" or the already implemented website [allsides](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) where the authenticity and leaning of a source could be judged anonymously. Alas, this will just further contribute to the ongoing issues with segregation and political beliefs.

Odd, from my experience r/worldnews tends to be a massive, systemic circlejerk of anti-Trump, anti-Russia, anti-Israel content. Users are discouraged from expressing their opinion because they don't want to get downvoted or insulted, (which is why subs such as r/The_Donald are so pervasively right-wing). If you want to make a change, get rid of the downvote feature. It will promote conversation at every point of the site and minimize segregation, which is a very real concept that very few address. If someone is insulting another user, there is a Report feature for that. The downvote feature is a catalyst for isolating specific users with specific views in specific areas of Reddit. Unless that's what you're going for, of course. That's why it's impossible to find a genuinely neutral source of news, because outlets such as CNN or Fox News tailor specifically to their respective audience, regurgitating exactly what their readers want to hear so as to not induce cognitive dissonance.

This list helped us to identify communities that met a minimum threshold of engagement with posts from the domain list.

>  
>The community must have active moderation  
>  
>The community must require that the post title accurately reflects the article title

Reddit is supposed to be a platform, a platform that you can interact with in many different ways (multiple web UIs targeted at desktop and mobile, apps, 3rd party stuff, etc).  You interact with it in whichever way works best for you, and that's a good thing because it's more useful for more people.  

As such, any new features like this should be device-neutral- able to be accessed from any device.  Otherwise (even in a beta test) you are screening out not only most of the users, but many demographics of users, from giving any feedback.

Your posted criteria [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/e1244tv/) look good on the face of it.  However there are communities that fit those guidelines but also have an extreme bias one way or another, and (on a community/voting level) don't welcome or tolerate alternative viewpoints very much.  
I don't mind a community that has a slant one way or the other, as long as the community (both moderators and users) are tolerant of opposing ideas and are willing to engage in discussion without mass-downvoting well-thought-out but opposing posts.

*As news of the Orlando mass shooting broke on Sunday, internet users turned to the /news subreddit to find out what was going on. But instead of the breaking news and comment they were expecting, they found comments deleted and threads locked. Even information about how to give blood was blocked.*

*Unbelievably, the most detailed discussion of the events in Orlando ended up taking place on the /The_Donald subreddit - not the place you'd expect to have to look for unbiased news.*

I don't mean to be presumptuous by that, rather, I just recognize that Reddit admins are human.  And when you spend your days talking about things like engagement stats and revenue per monthly active user and whatnot, it's easy to become focused on what you are trying to do (make money) and lose sight of what you are and why people love you (the platform).  

A perfect example of this is the old Digg redesign.  Kevin Rose had a vision for Digg- a place to curate the best of the news and whatnot.  But in implementing that, he lost sight of what he had- a community.  So with all the best intentions he launched Digg v4, and alienated most of his most loyal users.  While Digg was ignoring its community, Reddit was providing a fertile ground for communities to grow.  

Unfortunately, Rose didn't listen, and as a result Digg went from being one of the most popular sites on the Internet to a long-forgotten footnote in Web history.  

The great leader Dukhat once said, ""When others do a foolish thing, you should tell them it is a foolish thing. They can still continue to do it, but at least the truth is where it needs to be.""

It wasn't compounded with any hateful speech

It's a word, and if sad internet warriors can't handle words than that explains why they're here on the internet and not out confronting real hate speech, because they're pathetic facist losers who want to try and control the words that come out of other peoples mouths if these words don't fall into what **they** deem as socially acceptable, and in my opinion, that makes them a bunch of gay dumbasses.

free speech is impossible on the normie net now. and the places that are supposed to be free speech end up attracting an overpopulation of extrema which puts off anyone else from using it.

I would say maybe bitchute is the only okayish youtube equivalent type site. But for news and discussion, i mean you'd have to go to a chan [4 or 8] and thats usually just hard left and hard right. 

lets look at fundraising patreon alternatives. You have freestartr that was a professional approach alternative to patreon (patreon which has been breaking the unruh act in california pretty frequently -can't discriminate by political affiliation)

So what happened with the philosophy of ""if you don't like it build your own""? well  it ended up having its main payment processor suddenly reject freestartr after completion and finalisation of the deal and now its left relying on crypto and other stopgap measure to run.

If people's political ideology interferes in the very basis of hosting, domains, delisting from google, demonetisation from youtube, choices by people in mid level positions of power in payment processors, and so on, how can we say there is such a thing as free speech on the net? what happens when the politics you don't like is in power, the tools of reppression used on your ideological counterparts would then be used on you.


In fact the only thing not yet targeted by the far left [and me pointing it out makes it vulnerable] are the sites that help support superchats for things like irl streams or debates online. 

Once that is done, there is no free speech because free speech costs money.

I don't think it was completely glossed over. I remember there being a lot of frustration about that and front page posts at the time. I think people just felt powerless to do anything about it and felt Trump was a greater evil.

Not unlike how many conservatives who weren't fans of Trump's behavior still banded around him after the primaries due to what they felt was the greater evil of Hillary and liberalism.

Now onto your claim about CNN being better than Fox...

Here's an incredibly short list of times CNN has knowingly lied about things to advance an agenda:

1. [CNN editing video to create a lie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8Cn6boqcA&feature=youtu.be)

2. [CNN and Anderson Cooper lie about past reporting they've done, and pretend that audio of Hillary laughing about a child rape case is somehow ""not authenticated""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpwPwhvabi8&feature=youtu.be)

3. [Here's CNN's Don Lemon doing the exact same thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvb3MdgCZPw)

4. [Here's CNN pretending that looking at Wikileaks is illegal... But it's ok for them to do it... because they're the media...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg)

5. [Here's CNN coaching their ""focus group"" on what to say after the debate...  Spoiler, it's pro\-Hillary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI)

6. [CNN doesn't want to tell us what Trump *actually said*, so they'll just doctor his tweets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Eps97Mp_s)

7. [It's always so unfortunate when technical issues cause cuts in feed every time someone say something bad about Hillary... especially when they were with Bernie till the end!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw)

8. [Of course they would employ Donna Brazile, head of the DNC, who is happy to pass along debate questions to Hillary. At least until she got caught...](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-shared-additional-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign-identified-her-tipster/)

9. [And then the same thing happened for Wolf Blitzer. In fact, CNN got every DNC staffer's input on what questions they would like this ""impartial objective news service"" to ask Trump](http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/06/wikileaks-emails-cnn-asked-dnc-for-questions-for-interviews-with-trump-cruz/)

10. [Here they are backing down after being threatened with a lawsuit for calling Assange a pedophile](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/312654-wikileaks-threatens-cnn-with-defamation-suit-over-pedophilia-claim)

11. [Don Lemon identifies ""random protestor"" as a CNN technician, after an astroturfing spiel about the electoral college!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6izexFkN4)

Now please go ahead and show me how Fox did the same.  CNN is, with no doubt whatsoever, a fake news organization no matter how you define fake news.  For goodness sake, they pretended their cameraman in the field was a protester to advance the political agenda they wanted to advance.  That is verifiable fake news.  They colluded with the Hillary campaign to ensure that Hillary would know the debate questions in advance of the debate, that is actual collusion (as opposed to the bullshit Russia collusion).  So let's see your list of Fox doing anything like this.  Fox is certainly biased right, but they aren't fake news like CNN.

Here's Wikipedia's discussion of it:

>Algorithm
Through the use of ""sticky posts,"" a moderation function of Reddit that allows selected posts to be artificially placed at the top of a subreddit, the moderators of the forum were ""gaming"" the algorithms[76][77] in order to dominate the content on the /r/all page, which is a representation of the most popular content on the website.[3] Additionally, users are often apt to flood the website with waves of identical images or posts, a direct violation of site-wide policies regarding spam. In response, Huffman rolled out a change to the /r/all algorithm; he noted that /r/The_Donald was among several Reddit communities over the years that ""attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else.""[13] Ongoing problems with members of the subreddit brigading and harassing other subreddits forced Reddit staff to modify the site's software algorithms to limit the offending posts to the subreddit. The Reddit team introduced /r/popular to replace /r/all, which included most popular subreddits except for The_Donald, and as a result the subreddit could no longer reach the front page.[78][79] In February 2017, Reddit overhauled their algorithms even further to prevent content from the subreddit (among other communities) from ever being seen by logged out users or people who do not have a Reddit account.[46]

Where'd I do that? Please show me. 

That community was taken down for repeatedly and flagrantly violating Reddit's TOS about targeted harassment. Remember that? When FPH had an organized, concerted, subreddit-wide effort to bully and harass people who had nothing to do with the FPH subreddit? Reddit had every right to do that, but it wasn't because of illegality, it was because of a different content policy of the website.

Not feeling particularly persecuted at the moment. Illegal subs get taken down, albeit often way later than they should, and Reddit is better for it.

The [Legal Affairs (JURI) Committee proposal](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fTEXT%2bREPORT%2bA8-2018-0245%2b0%2bDOC%2bXML%2bV0%2f%2fEN&language=EN) lead by Axel Voss, MEP, was rejected with 278 voted for the proposal and 318 voted against it. What does t his mean? 

This is not the end, this does not mean that the Copyright Directive is off the table. The vote today was not about deleting Art 11 and 13. It's about having a full plenary debate and allowing amendments to improve those articles. Now, the file will be debated in the Parliament and open for amendments. 

There are alternatives (written by EPP members) on the table that would still protect authors but without collateral damage to the open internet ([article 11](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reda-compromise-11.pdf), [article 13](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reda-compromise-13.pdf)). There is also room for improvement in many other articles that would benefit libraries, museum and schools. [Here is an overview by EBLIDA](http://www.eblida.org/News/2018/EBLIDA%20recap%20of%20JURI%20DSM%20vote%20of%2020%20june%202018_FINAL.pdf), *European Bureau of Library Information and Documentation Associations,* that might be useful for some to understand the scope of many of the amendments. 

What will happen next? 

Now, extreme lobbying will begin in the EP. What we need to be careful of is that some of the amendments of the JURI committee were actually quite good - when it comes to the public domain, preservation exception, educational exceptions, out of commerce work, etc. Getting those amendments into the state where we are now has been a lot of work and even though there is always room for improvement, then there is also room for good work to be undone. 

The focus needs to be on article 11 (the press publisher's right) and on article 13 (the 'filter') and also, in my opinion, on article 3 (text and data mining) and article 6 (Common provisions). 

This was merely one vote of many, the next vote will decide upon the Parliament's negotiating position in the Trilogues (between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament). When the trilogues are done, the decision is ratified by the Parliament and then within couple of years adopted into national law of your member states.

#Why shouldn't reddit have to share revenue with the content creators you sell advertisements against? 

You keep repeating this statement like it is a bad thing:

>and require licensing fees for all links.

Why is this bad? Why should reddit be able to host, via i.reddit, web comics and photographs of copyrighted content that doesn't belong to it, and only have to take it down *after* the copyright holder finds it and requests it? Why is ""forgiveness"" the only acceptable policy for you? Why does reddit not have a revenue sharing program like YouTube already in place, and why do you resist addressing repeated questions about it?

This is poorly written legislation as it was designed, but it's not a poor concept. You host content from copyrighted content that isn;t yours. Not just links to articles, but sometimes whole articles ripped from the source and reposted here. Half of your major content is just mild tweakings of content copyrighted by others. Most of the gif subs are straight rips outs of videos owned by someone else who gets no compensation for entertaining redditors, while you put advertisements against them.

**Why should reddit continue be able having a free lunch and not give back to the content creators whose stuff you use without asking to make a profit?**

You want us to defend you. I like reddit and want it to continue. So give us the sound reasoning who you shouldn't have to pay out, or have to restrict your site from making money off of content you're not authorized to host.

*****

The first is the obvious, bills like this don't just roll over and die. They take on new form, as some moron with an agenda to push attempts to force the same shitty legislation through under a different name. The reason? There's a lot of money to be made by controlling the internet.

Why? It's simple. The internet is pure, in most cases undiluted, information. The control of information is one of the most important things for anyone in power, and extreme power can be gained if someone were able to control a source of information as vast as the internet. Even partially, even temporarily.

So attempts will continue to be made to control this medium until the world has moved beyond the ability for any single power to control it. We have to always be vigilant against those who would try to exert unfavorable control and support those who would try to protect the free exchange of information the internet represents.

*****

The second one is less obvious. This is, what, the third or fourth time now an internet grassroots campaign has stopped a major legal attempt to control the internet like this? It's only a matter of time before people start acting on it, doing anything they can to disrupt these movements, or otherwise hijack them for their own cause.

As I said above, there's simply too much money being lost to continue to support this bad legislation. There's too much at stake in allowing the internet to remain the mostly-free information exchange it has been. The people behind these laws won't take our disruption lying down forever, they will eventually move to act against us. I'd like to think it will always be comically inept, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be on the lookout for people trying to disrupt movements like the ones taken against this law, or SOPA/PIPA, or the other variants that keep rearing their ugly heads.

Third, and finally, we need to be cautious of the sources we trust to tell us to act. This ties in to my second point, that people will try to hijack these movements towards their own ends if at all possible. 

Remember, reddit itself was one of the sites we trusted to tell us this was bad, and it also stood to lose tremendously should the bill have passed. This time, and last time, and probably even the next few times - because make no mistake, there will be more attempts - reddit will continue to operate in good faith. But there could come a point where our sources tell us one thing but hide another. Perhaps a law is drafted that doesn't affect the way we interact with the site very much, but reddit still tries to tell us it's terrible. Perhaps it's Facebook, or Google, or somewhere else instead of reddit. Should we still support them in their efforts to block the law? 

As the saying goes, trust, but verify. It's fine to trust what we're told, but we should never, ever blindly follow it. We need to verify that what is being said matches what is going to happen. This is the first line of defense against ensuring our freedoms are protected.",False,False,False,417449,3869,1397444034.0,False,False

Those small artists who receive no money, because of someone uploading their music, do have something to complain about, but this censorship is a solution that'll create more problems. I have a proposal for a solution for those artists, however:

Say you have made a great song as artist that could make you money. One time, someone decides to post it on a platform under their name. When people find out that person posted something thats not rightfully theirs, which that same person made money of, the person has to pay everything he/she earned from it and everything they will receive. This is no fee, this is no censorship and all the person has done now is given some free commercial of a song (or whatever copyrighted material). I also think that if for example the song was posted on YouTube and the one who owns it didnt post it on YouTube, YouTube has to pay back what they got from that video as well.

Why should an authority figure decide what contracts between two willing parties can contain?

>Why should reddit be able to host, via i.reddit, web comics and photographs of copyrighted content that doesn't belong to it, and only have to take it down after the copyright holder finds it and requests it?

What if the original copyright holder prefers it that way? What if I, a content creator, want my content available on Reddit to be freely perused by those who want to see it? Now about the theft thing. Say someone takes your lawn mower. They sell it to a pawn shop. Should the pawn shop really have to get the original proof of purchase or something similar from the seller before buying the lawn mower? Of course, if you come (typically with some authority figure) with proof the lawn mower is yours, they have to give it back. That's all good. The pawn shop doesn't have to pay some sort of fine, though, and they don't have to run every purchase through a database of owned lawn mowers that doesn't exist to buy a lawnmower, though. 

>Why is ""forgiveness"" the only acceptable policy for you?

Because it's the only technologically possible one that doesn't break the internet. 

>Why does reddit not have a revenue sharing program like YouTube already in place, and why do you resist addressing repeated questions about it?

That's a valid question. It'd be neat if they did, but I'd imagine the real reason has a few answers. First, they don't police what's on the site too hard. If they wanted to pay people for their content, suddenly, many people will view Reddit differently based on who they pay money to. It legitimizes some of the content. Second, I don't think Reddit could afford it off of ad revenue alone. Maybe they could just give users a cut of ad revenue, but I'm not in their accounting department. This one seems fixable, though. Third, reddit is all pseudo-anonymous. Lots of people post content here that would make them ashamed in their personal lives or is extremely personal information that they don't want associated with their real lives. 

Essentially, content creators get paid for their content through two things. The first is free hosting and publication of their content to an audience who is already interested. The second is the option to be pseudo-anonymous. That's why people don't get paid money here; they get paid a different resource.

>This is poorly written legislation as it was designed, but it's not a poor concept. You host content from copyrighted content that isn;t yours. Not just links to articles, but sometimes whole articles ripped from the source and reposted here. Half of your major content is just mild tweakings of content copyrighted by others. Most of the gif subs are straight rips outs of videos owned by someone else who gets no compensation for entertaining redditors, while you put advertisements against them.

Well, a decent amount of your examples are covered by fair use and parody, at least in the US. We can have a discussion about whether fair use and/or parody exceptions to copyright should exist, but blaming reddit for profiting off of fair use/parody and making it seem like they're doing something incredibly shady is disingenuous. 

>Why should reddit continue be able having a free lunch and not give back to the content creators whose stuff you use without asking to make a profit?

Without asking? The vast majority of content posted on reddit (comments included) is original content. If it's original content being posted by the creator (almost every single comment, btw), Reddit has already covered the 'asking' part. It's also not a 'free lunch'. They're hosting and publishing said content. They pay for that half of things. 

Now, if some redditor takes a picture they found on Tumblr and posts it to reddit without the author's consent, there's an argument to be had. Still, if we include comments in the 'content' part (which we should), Reddit is mostly OC.

>So give us the sound reasoning who you shouldn't have to pay out

Because they pay to host the massive community here in exchange for the content.

>have to restrict your site from making money off of content you're not authorized to host

This is a good question, but I'd say the biggest reason is it doesn't work well. YouTube's system is ridiculously bad and is abused all the time. I can't think of a great system that isn't heavily abused. Maybe we should be working towards one, but we're not there quite yet. ",False,False,False,108815,20135,1351806672.0,False,True

Many, many people who seek comfort or want to share a negative results experience and keep it private (sexual assault, domestic abuse, etc) would be forced to either not or legally associate their account with their identity. 

I'm not saying there isn't a problem that needs to be addressed. I'm saying that forcing people to fully associate their legal selves with their online selves in order to disseminate content means we'll see a lot less content that isnt socially acceptable or could be dangerous to share. 

I'm really not sure what the solution is.

Oh bull-fucking-shit. The internet existed long before advertisements shitted the place up, and it'll keep right on existing if every marketing department falls over dead. It's just cables and boxes, miles and miles of it. You don't need anyone's blessing to publish -- that was the entire point! TCP/IP was created to treat all traffic equally. All are peers. There are no servers and clients. The network doesn't care what you are, it's just the messenger -- just a tool. 


The argument you're making would have us all under the boot of the same ""benevolent"" dictatorship that musicians and playwrights are under -- the MPAA and RIAA, who control the means of distribution and take the lion's share of anything an artist could make from their work. They get fat while the artists starve, and that's the model you're backing. And big fucking surprise -- YouTube is making a killing and yet out of how many tens of thousands of bloggers trying to make it on the platform... how many of them actually are? People spend hours and hours on that site, eating face after face full of advertising, and how much of that is making it to the people who make Youtube anything more than a digital graveyard? Almost nothing. Just like pre-internet media.


Get a grip. Piracy isn't killing artists -- the people who control the means of distribution are. And for the record, art predates even the written word. There have always been artists -- and they don't do it for monetary gain, or to shit out advertisements. There's no ""ENJOY COKE"" next to the cave paintings of early humans. Art will happen because it's intrinsic to the human condition. And because it's so important to the preservation and advancement of our culture, and a part of who we are, we establish ways of giving them money to support those endeavors.


But they're not motivated by money, and shame on you for thinking it can only spring from money. Look around at the art that money makes -- it's formulaic, boring, and contributes no lasting value to a culture. But the labors of love, the artists who bleed onto our books, our screens, our ears? They last. They don't seek riches or fame... they seek something else entirely, that I don't think you could ever understand.

If a third party is successful due to spamming like what youtube neglectfully encouraged for so long. Then you ban those accounts maliciously breaking the system and perhaps send their info into some gov criminal agency.

I think with the whole YouTube debacle, it's been shown that the DCMA while perhaps a good idea in theory is unworkable and prone to abuse. The DCMA needs to be scrapped and replaced by laws designed by people who are actually qualified and don't hold a vested interest in the way the laws work. Politicians in this case are not qualified, don't adequately understand the material, and often design their legislation around who as handed them the most money under the table.

> > How would you like to deal with literally thousands of websites to claim your share of the revenue?

> Thats the point though, the enitre thing is ""your share"", should it morally and legally be Reddit's share to monetize on something they didnt create and are directly encouraging people steal. This even close to Google who is only an aggregate for links and sometimes adds context in those links. This is directly taking other people's content and making money off it, just like Facebook (look up smarter every day for a video on it)

Technically Reddit does not take peoples content and monetize it. Reddit is a platform completely beholden to it's users. It's the users who find the content and ""share"" it on Reddit. Reddit makes it's money from the commenting and shitposting that gets done. The site could very well function without the ability to link to other content, see subreddits the likes of /r/iAmA, /r/AskReddit, etc. There is plenty to do on Reddit that doesn't involve infringement of 3rd party copyrights.

> > already been resolved in the Music industry

> There are significantly better avenues for music artists which dont require getting fucked over. You dont have to register with anyone, there is no reason why you need to register with a licensing body anymore. There are actually services which on behalf of you take down infringing content without bending you over

Ok, so content creators could find one of many 3rd party services to police their content but they are still only going to receive cents in the dollar. Sure, it may be more than a central authority, it also may be less and beholden with conditions like a minimum monthly earn before you get paid, etc. The whole system will be open for abuse and profiteering.

> > the Free Publicity back to your website where you can make your money would be better than the cents-in-the-dollar you would make from paid links.

> Thats not up to Reddit to force that opinion on others, some like exposure. Some loathe the idea of ""your being paid in exposure"" because they have to put money on the table and dont have a need for being paid in that currency

If I made content, my personal belief is Sure, link all you want to my content, so long as you do it in a way that directs the traffic to me in order for me to make my money off my own sponsors/ads, metrics, etc. Hotlinking to the content directly is a shitty thing to do.

> and stating its fine because its only a little bit of money per click, is like saying nigerian scammers are fine because they only take a few cents from millions of people every day

Using your analogy, Reddit would be a place for people to say ""Hey, check out this Nigerian scammer I found, they seem really cool!"" It's not Reddit who went out to find them. Then again, if you look at the way the Internet works, the whole system is based on linking content. It's as if the internet was build around the idea of free-flow of information without being encumbered by restriction. To turn around and require payment for links is destroying the core of how the internet was designed.

That being said, my belief really is Copyright has been abused by big content for too long and needs to be rationalized. Copyright should not be automatic but if you want protection the content should be freely registered with a central Copyright authority before you make it public. Even if you plan to give it away the central authority knows about the content. This way the copyright is firmly established and cannot be abused.

Then the copyright for companies should only be valid for a period of 25 years with the option to extend for another 25 provided they can provide evidence their works are still being commercially exploited by the company. If the copyright is held by an individual then copyright should expire upon their death plus 25 years. This way, a work will be copywritten for a more than reasonable period. Copyright was never intended to be perpetual and provide a creator a means to earn a reasonable living from their works before it becomes public domain.

Artists' painstaking endeavours should be compensated. Throughout the centuries artists have relied on patronage (or independent wealth but thats a whole other story) to survive. If you don't compensate artists, you reinforce a social hierarchy where only the richest and most privileged have the freedom to truly create great art. Creating great art takes time and often substantial resources, and if you're spending all your time hustling something else to stay afloat then you simply don't have the same time or energy to invest in art. That's a fact. Not to mention how much stress and anxiety come from worrying about money. Creativity requires a sense of playfulness and joy and money worries can eat you up.

An Internet meme ( MEEM) is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of media that spreads, often as mimicry or for humorous purposes, from person to person via the Internet. An Internet meme may take the form of an image (typically an image macro), hyperlink, video, website, or hashtag. It may be just a word or phrase, sometimes including an intentional misspelling. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources.

2690,7if8i,e1v4d9o,t1_e1uz2f8,t3_8we31l,1530837077.0,6,"So are you just trying to find out why I support him? It's easy. I originally didn't like him. I hated him. He was uncouth, and arrogant. Once I found out he was running for president I thought he was a joke. I was still trying to decide who I planned on supporting. Well, I started looking at everybody's policies, and being somewhat liberal all my life, Trump wasn't an option.. Hillary, well that's another story. I thought she was a blatant Criminal and was getting away with it because she was a political Elite. I had those feelings before Donald Trump, and even more so during the election year. Once I saw Trump was serious about running for the presidency, I looked up what his position was on everything. This was the first time that I saw any candidate who focused so much on America, and the American people. This surprised me, bigly. Not only that, but I had just spent the past few years reading stories about politicians being paid off via campaign donations, and basically being tied to their contributors wishes. Once I read that Donald Trump was self-funding, along with the help of his supporters, his campaign... That was another big push for me into supporting him. Politicians have been getting rich off of our country for a long time, and that infuriated me. Out of the blue, here comes someone with no political background, self funding his campaign (no donors to owe), putting America first, and telling other politicians like it was. That was it for me. 

I completely understand his rhetoric, as well as the way that he talks about himself comes off sometimes. Hell, every time even. To me, that's a small price to pay for the type of leader I wanted to rally behind. The politicians I just spoke about taking donations in exchange for favors? I related them with the swamp that Trump spoke about. 

Now, you on the other hand have a much different story. Both of our stories have let us to this point. They are both very different. We see current events through totally different filters. We both have biases. That's natural, and it's Human Nature. I told myself in the beginning then I would support Donald Trump until his actions, and by that I mean provable actions, go against what I believe in. So far, everything that has been said against him, is mostly unproven and it's speculation. For example, when the topic of Russia comes up, I don't immediately think that he did it and therefore anything that is said has to be true. My perspective is that he deserves to be treated innocent until he is aquitted or charged via the Mueller investigation. I trust that the special counsel is doing its job, and I will disregard biased news stories with Anonymous sources, I will not let them affect my thinking, until I see a result from the actual investigation started for this particular matter. 

You and I both know how biased the news and media can be. We both should know, through critical thinking, that there are narratives to push. That being said, I will always take things released by the media with a grain of salt.

I believe Trump has good intentions, I don't believe he's a racist or sexist or a white nationalist, or nazi, or any of the hundreds of names he has been called since becoming president. I can say this confidently because I have thoroughly researched everything that comes out as a news story, and every time like clockwork, I see that it's either sensationalized or blown way out of proportion. Every time this happens it discredits the media in my eyes. If the liberal media didn't meltdown every time Donald Trump does anything no matter how trivial, then that wouldn't be my position. When stories hit the top of Reddit daily like a joke you made to the Canadian Prime Minister, or that he forgot the words to a song that isn't very well known in the first place, it reinforces my stance. 

I hope this gives you some insight on how people can be Trump supporters and disregard everything that comes out against him on a daily basis. You are still going to have your beliefs, and I'm going to have mine. This will likely never change, because we have different stories and different paths to our belief systems. I'm okay with that, I just wish we could get along.

Then the original pasta-replier returns to claim that, in his experience, the gaming community is racist/sexist/rapey.

You then reply refuting a claim nobody made, namely that gaming doesn't make you any of those things.

What am I missing here?

Regardless, I'm a gamer and I have been for two decades now. I've frequented gaming related discussion boards for most of that, and I don't really disagree with the claim. I'd say it's a very poor way to express what you mean, as the political incorrectness of the statement will rile people up (such as yourself) and cause a very defensive response. A better way to put it, I'd say, is that compared to school or work, social gaming can expose you to a lot of the aforementioned behavior at a degree you simply don't experience elsewhere.

I'm also sure that part of the reason incivility runs rampant in gaming is because, as you say, anonymity.

The [Unfair Advantage](http://deepfreeze.it/article.php?a=unfair) article is a decent place to start. 

None of the articles Grayson wrote covering her were reviews, which is the origin of your denial - some people on the internet who heard about the controversy assumed that a conflict of interest involving a game reviewer must be about a game review, but actually the conflict of interest was for other kinds of coverage. Zoe's business model wasn't even about selling games, it was building and then monetizing her personal brand. Note that from the beginning the actual articles and videos on the controversy (like the original ""Quinnspiracy"" video) got this right and called it ""coverage"" rather than ""reviews"".

Grayson and Quinn [were already friends](https://pastebin.com/1ePCqJLz) when the GAME_JAM article was published, itself sufficient for a personal conflict of interest, and became sexually involved within a week afterwards. Two days after the article was published, Grayson and Zoe went on their [planned trip to Vegas together](http://i.imgur.com/TVY3bUg.jpg), during which they first slept together according to what [Grayson said to Totilo](http://archive.is/8KjOG#selection-2701.287-2701.302) and [Zoe in TZP chatlogs](http://archive.is/RfAp7#selection-781.185-781.198).

Grayson's excuse to Totilo (which Totilo accepted) was that since they supposedly didn't have sex until a few days after the article was published, they weren't in a ""relationship"" at the time, so even though they were at the very least friends before than and were doing stuff like planning trips to Vegas indicating their blatant personal conflict of interest, it's apparently fine with Kotaku.",False,False,False,69478,34694,1432333232.0,False,False

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian government.

Reddit, like all too many online communities, are all too keen on patting themselves on the back when things happen to go the way they hoped, regardless of the actual facts. Now if you want to talk about the *actual* major contributors... Here are a few:

- Religious leaders. The evangelicals, led from the pulpit of local churches, voted Trump in massive droves, with white evangelicals being **by far** the most single-mindedly Republican demographic.
- Conservative radio. These guys have a long history of influencing the masses.
- Conservative TV media. Fox News is the obvious one, but you can't forget about [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo) and their widespread control of local TV channels.

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:



Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

From the paper you linked:

>The relationship between concepts like open-access, network neutrality, and broadband discrimination may be unclear to the reader.  It is best to understand network neutrality as an end, and open access and broadband discrimination as different means to that end.  In this section we will examine both why network neutrality might be an attractive goal, and, how an open-access and broadband discrimination regime differ as means toward that end.

One example in his paper that goes against the idea of Network Neutrality:
> They are suspicious of models of development that might vest control in any initial prospect-holder, private or public, who is expected to direct the optimal path of innovation, minimizing the excesses of innovative competition.12 

I think it's clear that you and many others who are behind the 'net neutrality' buzz haven't actually read this paper, where he brings up many cases of where discrimination on the network can be beneficial and is used already.  He also speaks about how discrimination can be used as a means to an end to achieve network neutrality.

As I said, the idea of 'net neutrality' is debatable when dealing with the government and law.  What is 'neutral', and who determines what that definition of 'neutral' is?  I prefer the idea that business decide what is neutral, as businesses will decide based on market research and use, not political maneuvering and ideals.  This is where the real debate lies in 'net neutrality', who controls it.  The businesses or the government.  Taking a quick look at the government and seeing that they can't manage their way out of a wet paper bag, many come to the conclusion that it's better off without their meddling.",False,False,False,18324,49,1411239038.0,False,False
