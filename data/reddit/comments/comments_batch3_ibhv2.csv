in doing this i came up with a few reasons why there is a horde of programmers but no designers. programmers/web devs love to dig into a project like this, wrap their head around it, then make improvements on it cause open source is kick ass. this is stereotypical but i doubt to many designers do any kinda of open source work that is this extensive. most probably wouldn't even want to dig into a project this large.

oh and some of [this](http://images.sixrevisions.com/2010/11/11-02_webdesigners_vs_webdevelopers_infographic_small.jpg)

just thought of more to add. extensive html/css/javascript takes for fucking ever to load especially when you are talking about scalability. I mean reddit is usually walking with a limp any way if you added any more glitter it would sneeze and fall over. programmers make it functional but light enough to run and be scalable for a billion page views a month.
