That way you don't have to slog through lists of subreddits to find one you may like. 

I can think of a number of ways to implement it.

1. A page you visit that lists ~25 subreddits you aren't currently subscribed to but which you may like based on similar subscription of other users.

2. A random subreddit suggestion on the side of the page (either based on similar subscriptions or entirely random). This is most similar to Facebook but provide the ability to remove it and also allow the removal of specific subreddits from the suggestions. I can imagine some people getting annoyed at it constantly suggesting subreddits they really don't want to join like /r/jailbait.

I think you need to re-evaluate your logic.  We have been experiencing scaling issues for the past year.  It has been and is still one of the main reasons we don't have comment sorting (the other main reason being that we don't have the money to afford the necessary servers to enable it, which we have been more than forthcoming about).

You keep saying we made a promise.  I don't think we did, because we know better than to make those kinds of promises.

Regardless, I don't think we are bullshitting or weaseling.  We took out that feature because we could scale it and couldn't afford to scale it.  We can scale it now, but we still can't afford it.  There has never been a time between when we took it out and now that we have been able to both scale it and afford it.

We've been more than forthcoming with that information.

We miss that feature too.  I'd really like to know which of my comments got the most points.  I can't even go into the database and check, because it would cream the database.

Come and protest the shutting down of Reddit 'for maintenance', at the [Conde-Nast Building](http://www.petergof.com/nyc/conde_nast.htm).

Demonstrators will meet in front at 1:00 AM, EST, an hour before Reddit is scheduled to be shut down.

This will be covered by all major media! 

Please bring signs, banners, megaphones, air horns, any kind of loud noise makers -- including giant speakers mounted on tractor-trailers.

If you have elephants or narwhals, bring them.

Bring gas masks and wear protective clothing. 

Don't come if you're not prepared to get arrested! 

Attorneys are standing by, to make sure you get released after a few hours, when Reddit is back up again. 

Kevin and Alex from Digg are invited. If they don't show, we can only hang them 'in effigy'.

The Reddit Alien, himself, may attend.

Heck, some of us would even be willing to enable ""ad customization"" that uses the subreddits we have posted in to display targeted ads (as long as you clearly tell us what information you're using).

The point you need to communicate to Condé, is that most savvy internet users see them as fucking morons, and they need to try to be a little smarter when it comes to trying to service that community.

We all know that due to Markdown's link markup using parentheses\*, links that contain brackets are problematic. So far, when posting a link, it would often look like this:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline_(film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline_%28film))

The solution used to be to either escape the closing paren or to use %29 in its stead.

Now I'm noticing that with the new rendering engine the *opening* parenthesis makes the parser choke as well, whereas previously it didn't:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline_(film)

So now one has to escape both characters, or use %28 and %29. Going forward, that would be fine, but I wonder if this would also affect old comments that have already been posted?

Someone in possession of your private feed URL can retrieve that feed in your name without authenticating. But they can't use it to do anything else (that is, they can't use it to vote on your behalf, or use the key for other private URLs).

The key in the private feeds is a hash that contains the URL, your password, and a server-side secret key. Changing your password will invalidate all private URLs, and because the URL is in the hash, someone that has one of your private feeds can't use the key to obtain other private feeds. The hash also contains a server-side secret key, so they would need to know more than just your password to construct private feed URLs (of course, as raldi pointed out to me, this is enough to log in as you on reddit and go to the `feeds` page to get them)

That's actually a really valid question -- I don't know why you are getting downvoted for it.

It is because we never needed one before.  Usually the failover plan is to either fix the load balancer or bring up a new one if there is a failure.  Bringing up a new one only takes a few minutes, so it isn't worth the cost of always having two running.

The main reason it was such a problem today is because the monitoring was also down.

Canonical offers the ""same"" support for Ubuntu that RedHat does for 'RedHat Linux'.

RedHat doesn't offer support for their Fedora product.  It actually has a shorter support and release cycle than Ubuntu.

The difference is that Ubuntu has a history of releasing branched code without consent or support from upstream.  Debian also has a history of doing the same... and with horrific consequences.  OpenSSH anyone?

The fact that Debian maintainers and Canonical don't follow standards and don't get upstream approval (and even defy up-streamers) before releasing patched code into the wild is why Amazon doesn't have official Ubuntu AMIs, but does have official Fedora AMI's.

If it had to do with support they would be releasing both free and payed Ubuntu AMI's as that would be a more logical model.

But if the site is growing very quickly, or if you mis-predicted the order in which they will spring leaks, the leaks will form before you can get to them. 

Also, there's no point in plugging a hole that only leaks when you have trillions of users, because the cost of doing so (in time or money) is non-zero, and there aren't that many people, so it's not going to spring a leak. Accordingly, if you have 5 users right now, you probably want to fix the issues affecting them *right now* rather than the issues that *may* affect you when you have millions. I say *may* because most people are *really* bad at predicting the features that they need at much larger than their current size, and especially what becomes a bottleneck at that scale.

-------

Here's a better idea…

The admins seem to suggest that, once you hit the 'report' button, an admin or a moderator has to look at the report (and everyone else's who hit that button on something) and make a 'yes' or 'no' decision one by one.  That's inefficient and doesn't scale well.

**Instead of pushing the spam on everyone as an advert, why not automate that 'yes' or 'no' decision from the report feature?**

You know, like how craigslist handles it with user flags.  I'm pretty sure they don't have a physical person looking at everything that gets flagged.  It's an algorithm based on how many flags a post gets maybe over some period of time.

That way, you're not actively pushing the spam at everyone, and stuff will get reported and removed as people come across them naturally (and without eating up all the time our admins/mods put in to the site).",False,False,False,114191,40629,1210285182.0,False,False

What kisielk was talking about, I think, was *meta*moderation on Slashdot.  A random bunch of recently active users who have been on the site a decent length of time and have good karma are picked to metamoderate every so often.  You're given a big list of a bunch of comments that *other* people have moderated, and you select whether the moderation was fair / good or not (e.g., if somebody moderates a GNAA post ""insightful"", you should select that the moderation was unfair.)

At the same time, I suppose that the sheer number of users would outweigh the number of shill accounts.

I suppose it's a question of the user:content ratio - a high figure will mean we can let multiple people see an article, and go with the majority after x amount of time.  9 out of ten people say it's not spam, it's not spam, and so on.  A low number, though, could result in one douchenozzle seeing it, voting it ok, and it being entered into the main rotation (where, of course, it'll get downvoted into oblivion anyway, in theory.)  (Also, I'm curious.  How long will 'x amount of time' be?  Too long, and it'll still be piled into the new queue, too short and it may not see a reasonable number of eyes).

Another ratio to consider, I suppose would be 'users who give a shit:users' - how many people will just ignore/troll the big pink?

If I buy advertising on TV or Radio, I am told exactly how many times my ad will air and I know for how long it will be airing and during what shows.

On reddit, if I put in $200/day from my budget to advertise here, then I have no idea how much ad-space that's going to buy.

It could buy 10% ($2000 total/day for reddit ad revenue) or .5% ($40,000/day for reddit ad revenue)

I have no idea what your ad revenues are like, but if you're making $2000 a day, and I put in $20/day, that's not going to get me a lot of sponsored ad-space/time. And it will get worse, the more people advertise on reddit.

I think it's not too much to ask for an estimate of what a current ad-buy will get me on reddit. You could just put a little % thing next to the money/date box on the campaign page to give me an estimate of what my exposure will be for the dates I specified (as reddit knows it currently).

Then I can just monitor that % as long as my campaign lasts, and increase my daily ad-buy if I feel it's insufficient.


Edit:
>Like buying an ad on the radio. You have an estimated audience, but they can't guarantee a cost per listener.
>
>Either the ad did what you wanted or it didn't. It's a cost of business.

A notable difference in the advertisement styles: You can guarantee a known % of the audience on a radio show will hear the advertisement, and then guess what % of people on that show will act on the ad.

On reddit, not everyone is being served the same ad at the same time - only at the same rate. If I buy in a daily amount of 1% of the reddit ad space/time, then I'll get exposed to 1% of the users IF they click through reddit 100 times - and because it's exposing only that person to the ad, not the entire population of reddit at once, the chance of someone clicking on my ad (or using it) is more obfuscated, and I'd expect lower % than a radio ad (for people who don't click reddit 100 times per cycle).

together, in my opinion, will work to silence people who submit controversial opinions that don't align with the hivemind. You wish that people only downvoted links that they think should not have been posted because of lack of content, but this is not how downvotes are used.

Whenever I sign up for a site (let's say reddit for example), I create a forwarding email address for that site.  So let's say my server is coolguyyeah.com, I would create an email address called reddit@coolguyyeah.com and use that account to sign up for the site.  That reddit email will forward all email to my main account that is not published anywhere.

I also have a generic stuff@ and junk@ for situations where I don't have the time to create an address.  Anything that goes to stuff@ i usually intend on giving its own address and anything that goes to junk@ i know I don't need.

By using this method, I always know which site sold my email address and it's easy to just shut it down without affecting my main account.

I get maybe 2-3 pieces of spam mail each week and they all come from my junk@ account.  Once it hits the 5 mark, I'll close it and create a junk1@.

And in SEO procedures you have to create a gmail account for clients in order to set them up with Google Analytics and anything else you would need the email for (social bookmarking, for example) without needing access to their own personal email address. I don't engage in spamming reddit, or any social media sites, because I know better; specifically that users are not stupid and spam won't get you Page Rank or traffic. Lazy SEOs will do this however because it is time they can bill clients for, especially SEOs outsourcing from India.

All I am saying is that the lengths some people will go to in order to ""promote"" a site, while throwing out white hat principles, astounds me.

Because of that I ended up giving a little impromptu speech about how the users of social bookmarking websites aren't as stupid as you think, and you're not only wasting your time but the client's time as well by submitting their pages to these types of sites in the hope of increasing their inbound links and building page rank. I asked the room how many people have actually ever had a story, that they submitted for marketing purposes, gain traction on a social bookmarking site. No one said anything. So now my company doesn't even bother and that's one less SEO company spamming social bookmarking sites with bullshit that no one will read.",False,False,1272587570.0,2138,248,1255404675.0,False,False

How to ""stop spam"" is an extremely difficult problem to solve, with many factors to consider. One of the main considerations might be to define what is meant by the phrase ""stop spam"". Is it: 

1. ""to discourage or dissuade submissions of a spam-like nature before they are transmitted to the reddit servers"", 

or 2. ""to supress or censor public display of reddit submissions based on the content of a submission, and on the identity/source of the submitee"".

It appears that current approach (adopted by reddit, and by the modern email infrastructure) is more closely described by #2. I believe this aproach is extremely effective at preventing the display of unwanted spam, but that the nature of any censorship is morally un-sound. 

The approch described by #1 would likely require vastly more effort to successfully implement. It would also be difficult to quantify the success.

They have off-by-one errors in their local part storage and send messages to truncated addresses. They can't handle their databases correctly and send messages to adresses that include their column delimiters (such as ""|"").

So, yeah, +-subadressing is fine and if you really are concerned with spammers that drop that you can treat mails without a +-part as particularly suspect and have a more aggressive spam filter on them.

Another neat trick: for some time I have been posting on the Usenet with henryk.nospamplease as my local part. This was a fully valid and useful address that just echoed my wish for not receiving spam. However, a lot of spammers apparently string-match for ""nospam"" and either try to strip it off (trying to deliver to henryk.please) or figure it's no use and ignore the address completely. (There was also a worm some time back that sent massive amounts of mail to Usenet users, but ignored addresses with ""nospam"" in them.)

Also if you want to get more creative: RFC 2821 allows local parts of the form ""Foo Bar"", e.g. 
    ""Foo Bar""@example.com
would be a fully valid mail address and I doubt that any spammer will be able to send mail to such an address.",False,False,False,4008,1389,1133931600.0,False,False

I do not see how, say, /r/politics or /r/funny works towards this point. Also, what precisely is the /r/bestof community?

Yes, subreddits can spawn comminites, can be used to create ones, and apperance of communities is a desired upshot. It is also the sole purpose of password-protected subreddits. 

However, a general subreddit may not be a community. It can simply be a place where one can expect to find submissions of a certain kind.

The communities arise *because* of the grouping of information into categories. In the example you mentioned, the knitting women aren't overrun by requests for boobs only because that's not the place where one can generally find boobs, and it grows because people expect to find content about knitting there. I wouln't necessarily visit /r/knitting because the people there like knitting, but becaue I like knitting and want to find related content (be it submissions or discussions).

In any case, I was making a point that people disagreeing with you does not mean you are trollig and should not make similar submissions. 
I can submit an opinion self-post to /r/politics that would be appropriate to the subreddit, and still downvoted a lot; there controversial politics are controversial beacause a lot of people disagree on that matter. 

My point is that making every subreddit being /r/circlejerk is not your intention. This is why you have a link to controversial posts right at the top. ",False,False,1272605777.0,35612,6881,1215622312.0,False,True

And for every one of *those* there has been at least 100 bugs which may or may not have been exploitable that I never bothered to figure out if they were because I just *fixed* the damn thing, and nobody but me ever has to lay awake at night knowing just how crap the software that runs most of the world really is.
