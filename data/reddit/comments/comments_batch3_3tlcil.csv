No.

You have begun the slippery slope. Actually, you are well on your way down it. Your front page has already sunk to the quality of digg and facebook. Some smaller specialized subreddits still live, but even those are not the 'bastions of free speech' they once were.

Heres the canary in the coal mine : Nigger. Will I get banned? Probably. Will reddit die a long slow death and become just crap? Equally as likely.

For those that dont know, check out voat.co, where free speech and unsafe ideas still flow the way they used to on reddit. To anyone that 'likes reddit the way it is now' keep your fat titties here then.

Personally perfectly fine with all of that. But then again I don't have *that* much of a mind for privacy, so others may or may not be pissed.

 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on comments, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.

242,szj6l,cy0m11u,t3_3tlcil,t3_3tlcil,1450236526.0,1,"Two thoughts: 

1) Sharing of information should (tend to) attract more ad revenue, which helps pay for the technical work necessary to maintain operations and scale the capabilities of the site. Even those positions that support the organization behind the site but don't actually design or code any site infrastructure, e.g. the sales team, create jobs that would otherwise not exist.

They are indirectly paid by advertisers, at least in part. If not for these advertisers paying more in return for our information, then who would pony up the cash to attract the miracle workers requested in the Reddit job postings?

(It is my personal experience that coding server-side database functionality and selling things are difficult tasks; hence, my use of the term ""miracle workers."")

And just because Quora pays staff without relying on ads doesn't mean Reddit shouldn't. I've contributed sporadically to Quora but have found it to be a hive-mind of Ivy League elitists and West Coast programmers; whereas Reddit is much more diverse in terms of viewpoint.

(I'm sure the typical Quoran sees us a ""bunch of Muppets,"" but that's why we're Redditers and not wasting our time on Quora -- for the most part, as some overlap surely exists in some sub-Reddits.)

2) If you're Hell-bent on dissuading advertisers from getting your Reddit information, then find some way to prevent Reddit from hiring a decent sales team (who would otherwise bait advertisers); analytics experts (who would otherwise show the sales execs usage and visitor metrics); and machine-learning engineers (who would otherwise help Reddit serve more scientifically targeted advertising).

On the latter note, who pays Reddit staff? Advertising revenue alone surely cannot cut it, as the dozen or so Reddit vacancies -- although without stated salaries -- likely pay between $40,000 (for an account assistant) to upwards of $80,000 (for any of the engineering roles).

Include the non-vacant jobs, and the Reddit payroll easily approaches $1 million. Who pays Reddit this much, year after year?",False,False,False,-24,6,1450234477.0,False,False

I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

* How does hashing help to identify spam and abuse? Isn't hashing related to security? As in, for example I'd hash a user's password/ data to encrypt it and maybe add a salt value (preferably via CRNG or atleast some sort of not-easily repeatable RNG algorithm) to encrypt said person's data. How does hashing help in that regard at all? (I'm not very bright, and I've just started going through Cryptography, so please bear with me here). Technically you could encrypt/compress this data (IP/general user data) via hashing - which obviously helps because of reduced storage space at the cost of increased clock cycles, but how does that help identify spam and abuse? 

* Secondly, who decides what is abuse and what is not. On what parameters. For example: say I have a completely different opinion about some random topic, and some OP/ some user said something that really ticks me off, and I call him/her a fucking idiot. What happens then.  How is it treated differently from some some dude/dudette hounding a person over reddit/other places.

>One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter.

* Reddit acquired Alien Blue. Reddit needed to transfer Alien Blue to the Reddit Apple account.
* We re-launched Alien Blue under the Reddit developer account, but unfortunately, Apple has a policy that doesn't allow an iCloud transfer of data from two developer accounts. 
* The only option we had was to allow any/all users to upgrade to Pro for free for iPhone app and to remove Pro altogether for iPad, with plans of rolling the iPad app into a universal app for both iPad and iPhone. This is still the plan, but the launch date for the universal app hasn't been set as of yet.

This is useful because later on you can check if someone/something is the same as the previous thing, even without knowing what that previous thing was.

*User control over advertisement frequency, ability to suppress ads that are unwanted*

*Consideration for data usage, as many users are affected by data caps*



I'm not sure how this would play out, but would it be possible to allow users to set a preference for advertising frequency, or the ability to ""squelch"" certain ads? I'm a cord-cutter, and I am quite wary of excessive and obsessive advertisement through any form of media. It would be great to have some semblance of control over what I see and how often I see it, without needing to be cautious about the context of my comments. It's a big part of what drives me away from websites, or tv stations, or radio; not having some degree of control and being force-fed information that I really do not care to experience.

Additionally, how will this play out for mobile users, or any user who has an Internet Service Provider that imposes a data cap? Will the ads be primarily text based, image links, videos, some combination of all? If ads are to be served up, is there some consideration for the data usage, perhaps a maximum allowable file size based on what medium the advertisement is being served through?

I'm not saying that they will, but they shouldn't be able to do so in the first place.

Remember when spez said that they were going to add a ""send to admins"" button or something like that to PMs so you can report harassment?

If they already have the technical ability to read them, then isn't that button then useless?

Also, a few paragraphs of the privacy policy state metadata collection is done.

The types of metadata mentioned are fine, but the ones that are not (it is implied that they exist through the use of the word ""including""), could be *anything*, and we'd never know.

Let me give you a real-world example :

I'm the NSA. I can't really *legally* spy on your phone calls without getting a proper legal warrant and such official documents.

So, instead, I can get *meta*data about your phone calls:

* Your phone number

* Name of the caller (you)

* Name of the person you're calling

* His or her phone number

* What time you called him or her.

I'm not sure how most of that information would make the ads any better. Aside from them loading faster and not having your data go through a bunch of 3rd parties that may abuse it. Really Ghostery helps people who have websites keep everything under control.

Can you please speak to why there is no ability to comment on the iPad ads and why they are rolled into the feed vs. just at the top and disappear once we scroll?

This strikes me as a move to a FB-like feed inventory model that can dramatically increase the number of potential impressions.  The removal of comments from the AlienBlue ads seems like a direct attempt at stifling the inevitable negative comments, and the fact that vote counts are hidden solidifies that.

I realize this comes across as somewhat of an attack, but we've discussed various ad-tech-related matters before and I know you know your shit.  Would really like a straight business answer on these decisions as they are pretty blatant to anyone who pays attention.

If reddit wanted strictly the same computer, they would need access to some other value, maybe a MAC address or something.

1. Implementing a way for people to discover competing subreddits, that mods can't block.

No, it's not. 

There are probably many thousands of private messages sent via Reddit every day. The admins would not read *all* of them! In fact, they probably wouldn't read *any* of them in the normal course of events. Why would they? That's a lot of reading time, and they've got better things to do than read your messages.

But, if you clicked on a ""send to admins"" button, that would inform the admins that you *want* them to read a particular message - because, otherwise, they would ignore it just like the thousands and thousands of other messages they ignore all the time. Therefore, a button like that would be useful.

> We aren't told exactly all the kinds of metadata that they're going to collect, and as a result they could be collecting anything they wanted to collect, and we'd never know.

Commenting: We have always had the ability for advertisers to turn off comments  on ads. Previously on reddit.com and now in the apps. This is nothing new. The comments on mobile do tend to trend more negatively and less about the content of the ad and a general distaste for mobile ads. So advertisers tend to turn comments off on mobile ads because of this.

Feed vs fixed to the top: On reddit.com there is potential for 3 ads on any given page load (the Sponsored Headline, 300x250, and the 300x100). So the total number of ads per session can be quite high. But, on mobile there's not really a concept of ""pages"", it's more of a never ending stream of content. If we just had one ad at the top of our mobile feed, it would be extremely hard to make enough revenue to justify the cost of running Alien Blue. We need to be able to put more than one ad, especially since mobile users scroll _a lot_ more than desktop users. One ad at the top would never be seen. Even with 3 ads per stream load, we still won't be getting the same number of ad impressions that we would get from the same user on desktop. Mobile monetization is hard. With more and more internet traffic going towards mobile, it's important that we figure out a business strategy that respects user experience & privacy, but also makes enough revenue to keep Reddit healthy and thriving.

People who think that way can't be reached with any form of persuasion so the monkey may as well get his banana. Life's too short to fight all battles and I'm not fond of swimming upstream. 

I mean I think we have to acknowledge from the ground level that we invited EVERYONE to the conversation. You can't do that if you want to maintain a standard. The Bay Area of San Fransisco found that out in 69. The punk music scene found that out in the 90s. StumbleUpon! found that out the moment it opened its doors to IE users.

It is the elephant in the room that increasingly is being ignored only by management. Moderators should not be deputized lone wolf authorities on a web site that prides itself over its own discourse. 

I would also add that I don't think your echo chamber problem is going to be addressed. I'm in advertising, and I can tell you the single most effective tool to sell a product is to congratulate the customer. Reddit is taking the facebook approach: Isolate the user from dissenting view points to better identify markets for targeted advertising, and to keep their egos ramped up with self-congratulatory horse excrement so they're in a purchasing mood.

There's a component of that in what I'm doing here, but at the same time I can't escape the seriousness of my statements, I am not playing a bullshitter's devil's advocate.  I think this is a serious discussion where all valid arguments need to be recognized, not ignored, whether they are arguments against our chosen position or not, and I promise I'm trying to do that with respect :)

You ask:

> *What are the benefits, exactly?*

I say:

>> *and people have a chance to see where you stand*

> ***Wow, creepy.***

Just the other day, I responded at some length to a person who turned out to be a habitual troll.  This was pointed out kindly by someone else, and the troll responded by asking me if I was going to believe a day old account.  So I went and looked.  The brand new account had several long and very obviously sincere posts on other subs, serious topics.  The troll was a long time user that posted almost nothing but one line, ambiguous and mildly inflammatory and/or confusing statements; a shit stirrer, and maybe not so bright.

So I ask you, was it creepy that I took my only available means to try to figure out where these two posters were coming from, so I could figure out who I might best trust, and how not to be tricked?  I don't think that was creepy, I think it was just the right amount of accountability.  I got to see what other people let me see (they could use separate accounts but they didn't), and what I saw said something very useful about where they were coming from.  I also got the impression that the day-old poster was not new to reddit, knew exactly what they were doing, and was making use of the free availability of having multiple accounts.

Allowing posting history to be public allows others the right to form their own opinions, and sometimes that is invaluable, especially in a community where trolls, pranksters, abusers and assholes could easily abuse the privacy as badly as they can abuse the ability to look at other's history.  If you say something to me, I can look at your history, or lack of history, and make up my own mind how much I'm willing to trust you.  Without this, there would be no way to see how much shit someone was hiding.

> *People can never change their minds, never have a change of heart, never reconsider their positions. They should be tarnished, branded for life. Also, what they post gives clear intention, death of the author and all that. They never play devils advocate, for example. They never explore a topic before deciding it isn't for them.*

You raise extremely valid points there.  OTOH, I've changed my mind many times, been wrong, embarrassed myself for sure, lost arguments, been an asshole and a troll and a contrarian... I've done it all, and I've admitted as much publicly.  If you had several days, you could read my posting history and see it all in full gory glory.  If some asshole decides to do that, and wants to hold me accountable for something, and I disagree, then I'll think they are an asshole, and maybe I'll just have to ignore them and the shit they want to say about me.  Or make another account and start fresh and anonymous again.  I can live with my own behavior, or walk away from it.  And in extreme cases, I can even go and delete any past posts that I'm really afraid of (I've never done that).

> *Why not put down your full name and postal address? Or is that too much neck?*

Yes, that would be too much neck.  Even after five years of posting history, you would have an extremely hard time figuring out who I am, because I chose to be anonymous, and that is one of the extremely powerful aspects of Reddit, a crucial part of the freedom it gives us, that enables all the personal experimentation you so rightly mention and cherish.  I very fully agree, we need the ability to speak and discuss things without being exposed.  But it's a practical balance, and Reddit strikes that balance simply: you can have multiple user names freely and with no expectation of identifying yourself for real, and you can delete your posts if you want them gone.  For all we know, Obama and Putin are having fantastic discussions over in r/politics, and nobody but them will ever know, including each other.

But I recognize there is tension here, because ***in practice*** you end up with a single main user account, and you want to stick with it for various reasons.  It becomes inconvenient to switch users a lot, and you miss features if you are gilded on a main account but not a secondary account.  It would have been nice to be able to have a single master account, with multiple user names (personas) that would not be inter-visible except to the master account.  I think Reddit probably wasn't thinking that far ahead back when it was created, and it would be a radical restructuring of the system to change its core user account mechanisms now.  I expect we'll be stuck with the present choice, which is to make separate accounts and live with it.

> *I don't suppose you have any relatives, that every time you go home for Christmas, have to endlessly drag some stupid shit you did once in the past to introduce to the next person who dares to join your ""family"".*

If you don't know already, Joshua Goldberg was this guy who had multiple provocateur accounts on loads of forums.

He wrote a bit on Stormfront telling people to brigade r\/europe and other subs on reddit. They always point to it as evidence that r\/europe is being actively brigaded by Stormfront and they need to heavily censor everything there. 

Anyway, he had a reddit account called u\/european88 which he used to constantly post anti-Semitic and racist crap on r/european with.

He was arrested a few weeks back because he had one Muslim provocateur account on another forum that he went too far with and actually incited terrorism. Turned out he was a Jewish kid. He's wikipedia famous now:

Think about how mail (regular physical mail) gets routed - you need a destination address, and the postal system needs to know how to route from your address to that address.

It's the same with computers. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is just a destination on a network, and just like the postal system you need one on both ends.

Now, in the real world, addresses follow a pretty loose format and almost never change because they represent a physical location entity.

With the internet though, that's not the case. Each device needs an IP to communicate, and devices don't necessarily stay in one place. Plus there's the problem of there only being 4-billion possible IP values under IPv4, of which we've already run out. And of course your ISP can only assign you an IP they control - much like how you can't give your house an address belonging to a completely different state and city.

All that really matters is that the IP doesn't change out from under active connections (or at least, doesn't change from the point of view of the two machines talking to each other).

So if you A) know the IP of the system and B) also know what *time* that IP was used, it could be enough to identify a specific machine, even if something else ends up with that IP later. It's more complicated than that of course, especially with NAT becoming more and more common to conserve IPv4 addresses, but that's the simple version.

One weakness of hashes is that, if there's only a few values anyone would try to hash, you can just try all of them until something works.  To help with this, there are special hashing functions (cryptographic hashes) designed to take a lot of computing work, so brute forcing like that is harder.

If a wheel displays zero and you throw a 5 in its funnel, the display changes to 5 (0+5). Throw in a 3, the display shows 8 (5+8). Now, if you throw in another 5, you should get 13, but the display only has one digit, so it throws away the 1 and displays 3.

Now, imagine you have a number with 12 digits (like an IP address). You take the first three digits and throw the first one in the first funnel, the second in the second funnel and the third in the third funnel. Then you do the same with the second three digits and the third and fourth.

The displays will show you three digits that, seemingly, have nothing to do with the original IP.

Have you guys considered testing additional business models for mobile? My fear is that as the requirement to generate more and more mobile revenue creeps up, the walls over what Reddit is ok with and what it is not will topple and we'll likely be seeing high RPM auto-play video ads every 4-6 items ala FB.

In this case, the interests of the publisher seem somewhat misaligned with the interest of the user, but it might be the only viable model, so the lesser of all evils.

It's like, from a business and ad industry side, I totally get it.  As an incredibly loyal user of Reddit for almost a decade however, I can't help but loathe it.  Part of that is because I love Reddit due to its lack of ads.

Would you say there is a clear threshold for what is considered too high of a mobile feed frequency?

Also, is your stance on retargeting still that it is verboten? The comments higher up talk about the steps Reddit takes to limit tracking, but then goes on to say Reddit uses GA. Google does leverage data gained from its GA coverage to inform targeting, and they can match many people down to the name/phone number/address level.  That worries me quite a bit more than Reddit having the data TBH.

That leads to the question of what the official stance is on the privacy implications for users of Google having that data?  Obviously many folks like me run NoScript or other blockers, but that is conveniently impossible in apps these days, and I am left wondering what Reddit feels its duty is to its users, and how far that extends to the third parties it exposes them to.

It sounds like they are mainly storing IPs to fight spam. 

If that's the case and if they can manage it, they could structure it so that IP checks are near last in line. They can check a ton of other stuff first, and if enough of them flag that it *might* be a spammer, then they check against the IP hashes. (after all, if it's *probably* a spammer an extra few ms or even tens of ms of time on the request isn't going to hurt all that much for such a small and somewhat shady subset of users)

And by using an scrypt style hash and targeting 5ms (which is doable if they weed out the vast majority of requests that they are pretty damn sure aren't spam) they could then verify if a user's IP is on the spam list as a last resort.

At that point it would take commodity hardware about 250 days to generate a full rainbow table (assuming your earlier calc of 50 days / ms is correct). They can then rotate the salts every 100 days and get the same level of spam-fighting they do now but with the added benefit of not storing any IP addresses (and the added downside of more CPU usage).

And if they have a few **really** bad spammers (say like 1% of IPs cause like 80% of the spam), then they could do something cute like store a blacklist of un-hashed IP addresses and add IP addresses to it only when they hit a trigger of something like x thousand spam requests per the last 100 days.

However, this has several things going on behind the scenes for something the scale of reddit. First, sharing the logic for when something is hard delete vs soft delete means your system has to record when the user clicked the button. The delete command may not be immediate. What if your servers are lagging and one recieved a hard delete and the other, by the time it is ready, recieved it as a soft delete? Timing issues happen when you have time based events and these are the bugs that give most programmers nightmares. 

Second, indexing and materialized views are constructed on the fly for optimization. Think of this like a cache or the impulse buy section of a store - everything is there nice and easy for you to see and access. Updating this isn't a good idea. Instead, you update the source and rebuild these indexes and views on a timer, or after a certain number of events. This means our edit function is already good enough to do what we want it to.

I was suggesting a binary choice. Approve the post or don't. Don't silence it.

The front page will continue to rotate and people will get their say without being down voted into oblivion for a ""fascist"", ""that's just wrong"" or ""eww! gross!"" opinion or expression. Getting rid of the DV button will strip brigaders of a weapon they have had for far too long. I would go the extra mile and say peoples comment history shouldn't be accessed by anyone but the user themselves. The DV button swamps the bad as well as the good and if you do care for opinion (as you say you do) and expression you wouldn't want it to be swamped by easily nerve stricken people where their emotion comes before any reasonable discussion. Comment history also gives brigaders ammo to pointlessly attack without engaging in proper debate or without being part of a healthy community of their own. Instead we have syndicates of political nerve bags destroying other communities and individuals because feelings. What kind of philosophy is that?

People should have a right to be offended, be an arsehole or anything else while also being able to express themselves.

Also there are special types of cookies that can be read from one site to another so that would also be a way for one site to share with Facebook.

The reality is, internet ads are big business and they have figured out a bunch of ways to identify who you are by your browsers unique information. A 3 party site partners with some sites to store the data and with other sites to sell relevant ads, all without exposing your identity.

But there is practically no chance of any real data from one tabs page making its way to another tab.

Actually, this is only part of the truth. There *is* a difference between a moderator removal and a user deletion. With a moderator removal, the only thing that happens is that the removed comment is hidden from the subreddit it was posted in; the comment is still visible on the user's history page. The removed comment is also still visible to all moderators of the subreddit it was posted in. With a user deletion, the comment is also gone from their history page, and is no longer visible to moderators. 

While all comments - including moderator-removed and user-deleted comments - are stored on Reddit's servers, there are differences between a moderator removal and a user deletion in how and where those comments are visible to moderators.

By continuously salting, they no longer have that ability to compare requests from a given IP over the last 100 days so they might as well not store IPs at all (not that that's a bad thing).

When you try to lookup an IP you won't know which salt to use to get the same result.

So you would need to ""group"" IPs by certain categories that have nothing to do with the IP itself and give each group its own salt.

As a shitty example, you use the account's username as the salt.

That way you can easily re-hash any incoming IP addresses and get the same result, but not have the same salt for every person.

It's not quite ""one salt per IP"" but it's close enough to make a ""full"" hashtable impossible. 

That doesn't solve the issue for targeted attacks though.

If that is the case, as I'm understanding it, how do you think your extremism will be met?  The answer is equal extremism the other way. You're not uniting people, you are in fact doing the very thing you suggest you are against.

This is my point of it not being the answer.  It will only push an equal reaction the other way.

I truly feel helpless to the fact that my race, sexuality and gender mean that I am to pay a price in certain social circles and surroundings as part of this movement.

this is all stupid filler, so I will kindly ignore it.

>An obsession with diversity in the workplace can lead to bad ideas being followed because of the identity of the person making them.

And not anecdotal evidence. Give me actual citations.

>The same way that the BLM has largely been obsessed with defending criminals, instead of pushing for real change that would help reverse the massive single parent statistics among people of color. 

This doesn't even make any sense at all. WTF does this have to do with anything? Even if it *did* have some relevance in context, cite the idea that they're ""obsessed with defending criminals"".

>This is clear for any non-racist, and non-sexist to see.

Saying ""this is clear"" doesn't mean anything.

>Top firms might be less likely to hire women, to avoid frivolous lawsuits. 

You don't know what frivolous means.

>I actually pass-over all resumes I see which mention any sort of diversity-related activism... we simply don't want anything which distracts from our core mission.

Well this makes you an ass, but most people are not like you. Luckily.
