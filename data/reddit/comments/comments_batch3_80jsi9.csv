1. Your call is going to be answered by either a low-paid, overworked Staff Assistant, or often times an unpaid, overworked intern. BE POLITE. I cant tell you how many times someone called yelling at an intern to make the world perfect.
2. My office recorded down the content of the calls, the position of the caller on the issue, and where they are from. If the caller was not from the constituency, then would politely direct them to their own Representative. If they were nice, I would even look up their Rep or Senator and give them their office number.
3. It may also be beneficial to know that the staff/interns answering phone calls are given scripts pertaining to specific positions, or lack of position that a Rep/Sen may have. It's not worth it to argue with interns/Staff Assistants because we are just telling callers what we are told to say. Deviating from the script may lead to social media or other posts saying something like, ""a source within Sen/Rep's office today confirmed that the Sen/Rep's real position is _____ on the issue of pepsi vs coca cola.""
4. The Senator/Representative will get a tally at the end of the week telling them how many people called about what issue, not about the specific content of the calls. It basically is something like: 1000 people called in support of net neutrality, 50 people called in support of legalizing hemp, etc.

It is important to:
Keep your expectations low: Senators and Representatives have busy schedules and will not take constituent calls 99.99% of the time, even if you ask to ""talk to the Senator/Representative""

Again, be polite. The people answering the phones are literally at the bottom of the food chain, and can also have bad days too. You would be surprised with what kindness can do. I was willing to take a few extra steps to help people along every time someone was nice and polite.

Congress is voting tomorrow on eliminating section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Why is CDA 230 important?

With CDA 230:

If Reddit gets sued for a user's comment, the suit gets dismissed.  
If Facebook gets sued for a user's comment, the suit gets dismissed.  
If your blog gets sued for a user's comment, the suit gets dismissed.

Without CDA 230:

If MySpace got sued in 2003, MySpace would have ceased to exist.  
If Facebook got sued in 2004, Facebook would have ceased to exist.  
If Reddit got sued in 2005, Reddit would have ceased to exist.

Why does this matter? Doesn't Reddit deserve to get sued for comments made by T_D users? **FUCK NO!**

Think of it like this. Your racist uncle posts a comment on your blog about whatever. Regardless of what your uncle said, *you* get sued for that comment. Do *you* deserve that, or does *your uncle* deserve that? In this fictional scenario, your uncle deserves to get sued. 

""OK,"" you think, ""obviously *I* don't deserve to get sued, but *obviously* Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace deserve it."" Sorry, but no. We all started *somewhere*. Reddit started off as [just a couple of users](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/7ywejk/the_4th_and_5th_oldest_reddit_users/). Facebook started off as some college students meeting each other. MySpace started off as a couple of Tom's friends.

If the FOSTA bill passes tomorrow then nothing happens to the biggest companies on the internet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Reddit, Amazon, Twitter and others are fine. They're big enough that they can hire enough lawyers to fend off any suits. The problem is the next generation will **NEVER** have a chance. The second they try to get started they'll get sued out of existence because of one random user.

# How does this affect you?

Have you heard of Slack? Discord? Both of those companies are new, small, and trying to get started. If they got sued and couldn't win without CDA 230, then they're both gone. Can your startup survive that suit? Can your neighbor's? Can your child's?

To the honorable  ****, Net neutrality is essential to our society as American citizens. Cable television has been biased for as long as I can remember. The internet is the last front for true freedom of information. Letting a company censor this freedom of information is not only fundamentally wrong but borderline treasonous to our freedom of speech and information. Since the internet's creation America has made great strides in leading and shaping the world on the technology front. It has allowed businesses such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snap Chat to become wide spread phenomenon's to shape how we as people communicate with each other. Hindering this freedom is hurting future entrepreneurs from having a chance to create great revolutionary applications or websites that have the potential to fundamentally change the world. Besides this fact it is hindering the voice from the common citizen in America to post his views or beliefs to help inspire his fellow man. The lobbying of big business now has the potential to completely destroy their voice. But the most important part is how companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum can now regulate what information we as citizens can access. This is a huge red flags for many reasons but to put it into context here is one hypothetical example. Let's say I am a wealthy politician and I donate a wealth of money to AT&T for priority. This will prioritize my content over my competition such as easier access to my opinion pieces, videos, advertisements, news articles ext. So the common American using the internet will have seen my content substationally more than my competitor. This would fundamentally change how we view information on candidates in a hugely negative way. Most Americans depend on the internet for educational information. Putting a price tag on the information and having the ability to completely censor opposing views is unethical not only from an electoral stand point but from a basic humanitarian stand point. To give the power to a company to be able to censor the widest form of all information is one of the most dangerous things imaginable.

Maybe this will come off as condescending, but I think Reddits biggest mistake was not getting /r/The_Donald on their side for this whole Net Neutrality thing. Keep in mind I do occasionally go on T_D now and then to shitpost but most of the time it's for laughs. I'm a conservative who hated, HATED the repeal and didn't agree with it in the slightest. 


Yes you can find posts on there saying why the repeal would be good Yaya yada and posts praising the repeal, but a lot and I mean a LOT of the users generally didn't agree with the repeal and didn't want it. A lot of comments made it to the top on those pro Net Neutrality repeal saying why it was a bad decision. The_Donald was split for real that day between those that were for it and against it. When Reddit first started making strides to stop it, some users mentioned trying to rally The_Donald to try and help them fight for NN, yet other users with highly up voted comments said that The_Donald can go suck it and fuck them we don't need there help we can do this without them. Had the some reddit users put aside there differences and encourage T_D to help out, it would have been very beneficial to ALL of us, no matter the political view. Instead, the opposite happened and T_D users who were undecided decided to be for the repeal as a way to say fuck you to Reddit. Reddit Alienated The_Donald from the net Neutrality cause, you don't do that to one of the largest and most active non default subs on the sight, a sub that would have been a great help in the cause. *The enemy of my enemy is my friend* as they say, the reddit users who said those things and pushing T_D away from the cause made a mistake, they made a lot of users who would have helped out NOT help out. 


We can all disagree on politics and smear each other for that in our politically motivated subs all day, but when it came to Net Neutrality, having The_Donald as a ally to defend the internet would have really come in handy DESPITE the differences and disdain T_D and the rest of Reddit has for each other. I know some users will not like this comment, but I feel it needed to be said. 


I thank you all for reading this if you made it this far, no matter your political view I hope you have a wonderful rest of the day and hopefully NN comes back, I have made my calls and letters, we won't go quietly.

Edit: I said my piece, disagree if you would like I don't want to get into a big argument about it as it's pointless at this point. I'm just saying what I felt a lot of other users were feeling about the issue. I'm not a T_D user like I said, I will ocaciaonly visit to joke and shitpost but that's it.

What people seem to overlook is how ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, Spectrum, and AT&T even get their monopolies in the first place or just assume that their monopolies are an inevitability in the market. Big name ISPs lobby government, especially local governments, to make laws and regulations that effectively make it illegal if not impossible for another ISP to set up shop in the territory they occupy. For example, Google Fiber is installed in a select few areas around the country and is objectively superior in offering a good internet experience than the other big name ISPs. Google has stopped it's expansion of adding it's Fiber services into more cities because it was getting too expensive and tiresome jumping through all the legal obstacles. Now imagine a small ISP trying to do the same thing. 

Don't get me wrong, Net Neutrality sounds like a good thing but effectively it just covers the main problem instead of fixing it and gives the government easier access to pass future legislation to control the internet in the name of Net Neutrality. This is the same government that tried to pass legislation like SOPA, PIPA, and TPP. Now all of a sudden we trust them to pass legislation for Net Neutrality? I don't think so.

The solution I prescribe would be to write to your local representatives telling them to remove legal barriers, such as laws and regulations, to entry into the ISP market so that smaller ISPs can effectively compete with larger ISPs. With more options of ISPs, they would have to listen to their consumers because if they didn't we could simply move to another one. This is how it works in places where there are little to no regulations in the ISP market such as Poland and Japan. There, internet speeds are equivalent to, if not faster than those of Google Fiber with no throttling or censoring of websites. The free market works if governments would just let it.

On the bright side, ISPs will one day go the way of the Dodo. Maybe not soon, but there are other alternatives already in the making that will render ISPs obsolete. Alternatives such as mesh networking and the outernet to name a couple.

I'm guessing not many. I started off like many, the repeal sounded awful, but then I read about what removing the old law meant. This isn't even about NN for a lot of people here, it's anything anti President Trump, at least admit that. 

Oh, and even if the repeal was not a good idea (it is), you are not going to get us President Trump supporters on your side en masse about a censorship topic whenever we are the most censored, rule-applied sub on this ""user-driven"" site. 

""As a consequence, if the FCC decides that it does not like how broadband is being priced, Internet service providers may soon face admonishments, citations,7 notices of violation,8 notices of apparent liability,9 monetary forfeitures and refunds,10 cease and desist orders,11 revocations,12 and even referrals for criminal prosecution.13 The only limit on the FCC’s discretion to regulate rates is its own determination of whether rates are “just and reasonable,” which isn’t much of a restriction at all.""

""The FCC’s newfound control extends to the design of the Internet itself, from the last mile through the backbone. Section 201(a) of the Communications Act gives the FCC authority to order “physical connections” and “through routes,”28 meaning the FCC can decide where the Internet should be built and how it should be interconnected. And with the broad Internet conduct standard, decisions about network architecture and design will no longer be in the hands of engineers but bureaucrats and lawyers""

""So if one Internet service provider wants to follow in the footsteps of Google Fiber and enter the market incrementally, the FCC may say no. If another wants to upgrade the bandwidth of its routers at the cost of some latency, the FCC may block it. ""

""New Broadband Taxes.—One avenue for higher bills is the new taxes and fees that will be applied to broadband. Here’s the background. If you look at your phone bill, you’ll see a “Universal Service Fee,” or something like it. These fees (what most Americans would call taxes) are paid by Americans on their telephone service and funnel about $9 billion each year through the FCC—all outside the congressional appropriations process. Consumers haven’t had to pay these taxes on their broadband bills because broadband Internet access service has never before been a Title II service. But now it is. And so the Order explicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband. As the Order frankly acknowledges, Title II “authorizes the Commission to impose universal service contributions requirements on telecommunications carriers—and, indeed, goes even further to require ‘[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services’ to contribute.”36 And so the FCC now has a statutory obligation to make sure that all Internet service providers (and in the end, their customers) contribute to the Universal Service Fund.

Does this mean there is no room for legislation that truly ensures neutrality? Of course not.

"" In short, the court’s rejection of the First Amendment claims was based largely on a very narrow reading of the FCC’s order – a reading that would suggest that, for all its baggage, Title II is not even an effective tool for doing what it was supposed to do – preventing blocking or slowing of certain Internet traffic by ISPs that are purportedly undisciplined by market forces.""

""According to the concurrence, which was written by Judges Sri Srinivasan and David S. Tatel (the same judges who wrote the underlying decision btw), “the net neutrality rule applies only to ‘those broadband providers who hold themselves out as neutral, indiscriminate conduits’ to any content of a subscriber’s own choosing,” ""

""The concurrence goes on to say, “the rule does not apply to an ISP holding itself out as providing something other than a neutral, indiscriminate pathway – i.e., an ISP making sufficiently clear that it provides a filtered service involving the ISP’s exercise of editorial discretion.”""

"" And even supporters of Title II now appear to agree that the scope of Title II is limited to ISPs not offering a “curated experience.” However, in the past, supporters of Title II often alleged that without reclassification, ISPs would be free to block unpopular opinions or viewpoints that they disagreed with. In the understanding of the D.C. Circuit panel majority, it seems that the Title II order does not touch such practices as long as an ISP clearly discloses its blocking plans to customers.
Now, this point may be almost entirely academic since most ISPs have never indicated much interest in content-based blocking. But it is nonetheless interesting that the Title II order, as understood by Judges Srinivasan and Tatel, does not prohibit such practices. Before reading the concurrence, I assumed that the FCC’s rules would actually prevent ISPs from engaging in “editorial discretion.”

It is also noteworthy that Judges Srinivasan and Tatel did not limit this rather significant limitation on the impact of the order to blocking of Internet traffic.  Rather, they explain that it “would also be true of an ISP that engages in other forms of editorial intervention, such as throttling of certain applications chosen by the ISP, or filtering of content into fast (and slow) lanes based on the ISP’s commercial interests.” Wow. ISPs are not only free to engage in content-based blocking, they can even create the long-dreaded fast and slow lanes so long as they make their intentions sufficiently clear to customers.",False,False,False,40934,26060,1482695120.0,False,True

**Everyone here agrees that ISPs should not throttle/paywall/censor/restrict our content. Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:

**FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**

>Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651

**Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**

>Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508

**b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**

>The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503

**Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**

>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518

**UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **

>If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.

**Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**

>We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...""

**And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**

>176.We also reject AT&T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],”648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.

TLDR

*    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.

*    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government ""extravagant statutory power over the national economy"". 

*    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.

*    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).

*    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.

*    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.

*    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.

*    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.

*    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? Allegedly this FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.

If anyone is thinking of writing an email I'd recommend turning it into a letter to the editor and submitting it to newspapers in your state, in addition to sending an email. If the goal is to contact a senator, send a letter to the editor to a few of the 5-10 biggest newspapers in your state. If you're trying to contact a representative, send it to any newspapers within your district. In either case, make sure to mention the legislator you're trying to reach by name, preferably in the title. You should also look up the submission requirements for any newspapers you'd like to try to get to publish your letter.

Why the letter to the editor? Legislators are more likely to be influenced by a letter if they have reason to believe it could influence the opinions of their constituents, whose support they'll need to be re-elected.

From what I can tell from having worked in a senator's office for a summer, they almost never will read a letter or an email you send them directly. A staffer will do that, and if enough letters on a given subject come in, that staffer will draft a form letter response to send back to constituents.

But, in the office in which I worked, any letter to the editor that mentioned my senator by name and appeared in one of the 5-10 biggest newspapers in the state was included in a document that he read first thing every morning. I was often tasked with organizing and printing off copies of the document. I printed off the documents in the basement, where interns from a number of other senate offices were doing essentially the same thing that I did. So I know that practice was not exclusive to our office.

**TL;DR:**

Call your legislators, because that's the easiest and least time-intensive tactic available.  Send them emails and letters at well.  Those tactics are useful. 

But if you have the time, you should consider writing a letter to the editor and trying to get it published in a newspaper. That's far more effective. Legislators want to get re-elected, so they care what their constituents are reading about them.",False,False,False,322492,312078,1490542920.0,False,False

You want to turn it into a literally impossible to manage mess of millions of people reviewing legislation, where none of them had to do anything at all whatsoever to prove they even care.

* You're too ill informed on the vast majority of topics, which makes it easy to sway you with misleading information. And because caring about these topics isn't your full time job, you might not look into it thoroughly enough

* You very likely don't know enough about how the law works to write laws or to have an informed opinion of them. And if you do, congratulations, you're a part of *maybe* 3% of Americans.

Part of what makes net neutrality so crucial is that it levels the playing field for all websites, whether they be monolithic established companies or small startups. Eliminating net neutrality means that American ISPs can demand companies pay them a premium not to slow access to their website, just as much as they will be able to demand consumers pay extra to access different parts of the internet. This is bad because it allows ISPs to choose winners and losers.

For example, Comcast has a 30% stake ownership in Hulu. Without net neutrality, Comcast has no incentive to let its American customers access Netflix, so they'll probably decide to charge Americans extra not to slow or block their access to Netflix. Similarly, they can also go to Netflix and demand that Netflix pay them millions of dollars to be included in some premium ""entertainment pass"" Xfinity internet access plan. What this means is suddenly Netflix will lose tons of subscribers who didn't want to pay Comcast a premium to access Netflix content or who found Hulu more affordable because it didn't include that premium fee. So they'll be losing tons of customers to their competitor and will also have to give money directly to their competitor to stay relevant.

Now, Netflix is a big enough company at this point that they could probably partner with some ISP so as to stay afloat. TMobile is already advertising phone plans that are bundled with a Netflix subscription and unlimited data towards Netflix streaming. But imagine some new startup wants to enter the streaming market. They don't have an established customer base, any money, or any sort of reputation. How are they going to compete with Hulu or Netflix without an ISP partnership? Why would an ISP partner with them if they've already partnered with a giant like Hulu or Netflix?

Basically, the internet will stagnate, which affects everyone in the world equally. Don't expect some new social media website to dethrone Facebook like Facebook dethroned MySpace. Don't expect any revolutionary new services like Spotify to come along and change the way you consume music. The internet will no longer be a place for small businesses.

I actually have an issue with Section 230.

Should it be abolished? No, definitely not.

But I think it *is* too ambiguous right now.

Why?

I think hosts should still hold responsibility for hosting content that breaks laws, and should be held in contempt **if it is found they were acting in any way to not prevent it from happening and doing their... ahem... DUE DILIGENCE...**

So for example, no, a landlord shouldn't get in trouble with the law because one of his tenants was secretly cooking meth in his apartments he owns.

Fair.

BUT... What if the police then discover that tenants neighbor had issues dozens of complaints about these people cooking meth for the past two years, and the landlord had, uh, forgotten to mention this fact?

Hmm, suddenly the situation is more complicated, isn't it? It comes up the landlord really *really* needed these apartments filled, the meth cookers were paying their (very expensive) rent, and the landlord would lose a tonne of money if he kicked them out.

So he had been turning a blind eye for two years to these meth dealers because he needed the money.

Ok, so now do you *still* think the landlord shouldn't be responsible?

Because guess what, if this is a website (like youtube) and the meth dealer is posting, Oh, I dunno, borderline child porn for several years (cough-elsagate-cough)....

Then actually Section 230 still says that the landlord (Youtube) is somehow *still* 100% free of responsibility.

The provision you're talking about simply makes it illegal to **recklessly disregard** the fact that your platform is being used for child sex trafficking.

A lot of people said: ""reckless disregard? that's so vague! what does that even mean?"".  Well, fortunately, reckless disregard is already used in other laws and has a long history, so we know what it means: doing something when you **have good reason to believe** it's likely to cause a **specific harm**, and just ignoring it anyway.

What does this mean in relation to child trafficking?

Well, it means that if you **have good reason to believe** people are using your site for child trafficking (let's say it's been reported to you by police or the public), and you **ignore it and do nothing**, you have criminal liability.  I'm OK with that! I think everyone should be OK with that!

What it **doesn't** do: 

- allow someone to post child trafficking-related stuff on your site one time, report it to the police (but not you) at some later time, and have you shut down and taken to prison

Making site owners responsible for posts by every person would probably shut down most comments and posts on sites. 

If you want every site owner to screen absolutely everything you want to say on the internet before you are allowed to post anything then you would love the proposal (in H.R. 1865) to make site owners responsible for every post. 

However if you think the Internet should be more of a public forum where hosting companies don’t censor views then you want the Internet Bill of Rights.  

The big internet companies like YouTube and Facebook are now censoring people for political views.  This is shutting down Free Speech. 

They say they are private companies and able to do whatever they wish.  If that is true then  restaurant owners can start refusing to serve people they don’t like, your electric company can shut off your power for belonging to a wrong political party.   

Can a business that is supposedly “open to the public” refuse to serve people simply because they don’t like them?  That is why censorship is a civil rights issue. 

Btw—-Net Neutrality is an Orwellian name, in that it doesn’t mean what you think it means.  It has nothing to do with being a neutral public forum.  It only dealt with the ability to charge more for more data usage.  If similar rules applied to your cellphone we wouldn’t have different data plans.   

H.R. 1865:  Deals with CDA 230 and would force site owners to be responsible for what users post.  Might as well shut down the internet.

So in 2015, we classified ISPs as common carriers which put them under title 2, and meant that the FCC could *continue* to enforce NN rules.

Title II was used to enforce net neutrality and is about routing of packets, not hosting. This is a very common misconception and one that was spread purposely early on to confuse users that aren't familiar with the difference between an ISP and a website. When you talk about censoring you're talking about hosting and content providers. ISPs don't host content. They do however have the ability to route or not route packets. If you hate censorship then you'd support net neutrality since it stops ISPs from censoring sites.

If you're pro censorship then you'd be against net neutrality since then ISPs can throttle and block services and websites from accessing the ISP's customers at the last mile.

You can draw a table if it helps.

    | Routing | Hosting
---|---|----
Censorship| No Net Neutrality | Host censors
No Censorship | Net Neutrality | Host doesn't censor and allows anything

It's illogical to force a content host that has comments to show anything on their site unless you give them safe harbor and immunity from anything they host. This would never happen. Most people like that it's up to a site to decide if they censor or don't censor. If a content host was barred from censoring there would probably be no comments or social media.

ISPs as a routing are given immunity, save harbor, for the data that goes through them. They have no reason outside of profit to censor packets. Net neutrality makes this simple by telling them not to censor. Users can make requests and sites can send back responses with no interference. Without net neutrality ISPs are given full authority to control what their customers view with no transparency. Images that don't load are left to the customer's imagination. Did the service fail to deliver the image or did the ISP censor it. Without checking from multiple ISPs it could be hard or impossible to tell. (Multiple ISPs might decide in secret how to censor the Internet). Net neutrality's net metering transparency ensured this isn't the case.

Part of what you say is true. Treating all packets equally - net neutrality - is something that Comcast doesn't want. Why would they want to serve you youtube when they can throttle youtube and send you to their own video service? Comcast could control what you have access to, and google wouldn't like that.

Maybe Comcast is willing to deal. Maybe they threaten to throttle netflix unless netflix pays up. Netflix, of course, can just pass the costs on to consumers. 

A new company trying to break into the business, or more directly competing with Comcast, wouldn't have that luxury. Killing net neutrality stifles innovation and hurts newer or smaller businesses, to favor the big ole media conglomerates.

Net neutrality prevents the vertical integration of the internet into our ISPs and their affiliates and subsidiaries controlling what we can access.

That's not what the link says. The question was:

> Considering both distributional effects and changes in efficiency, it is a good idea to let companies that send video or other content to consumers pay more to Internet service providers for the right to send that traffic using faster or higher quality service.

It sounds sensible and the way they probably viewed it can make sense because the question is worded to assume that an ISP can offer faster or higher quality service and that such a configuration with ""fast lanes"" is beneficial. Your 23 page paper actually points out why this is a weird statement:

> It has long been technologically possible to prioritize Internet traffic, but it typically has not been delivered or priced on this basis. Despite the lack of any regulatory obligation, Internet traffic has generally been handled by service providers on a “first-in-first-out” and “best efforts” basis.

This has been brought up on numerous occasions that outside of high level quality of service routing such reordering packets or prioritizing is not something that helps. What it does create is ""slow lanes"" that are utilized only by large ISPs to leverage their customers. [Small ISPs have no advantage here](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/30-small-isps-urge-ajit-pai-to-preserve-title-ii-and-net-neutrality-rules/). Even Ajit Pai has been careful in his discussions to only talk about benefiting large ISPs without specifics on how small ISPs would benefit.

> ""Some are suggesting that because Verizon, Comcast or other ISPs have been dropping in their ranking via Netflix’s “ISP Speed Index Results“, it’s evidence that these ISPs are purposely making Netflix streaming from their network look bad. That makes no sense at all and would only hurt the ISPs business.

This has shown not to be true. Most people when dealing with a slow connection assume it's the service and not their ISP being slow. This is one of the reasons it's so powerful for an ISP to be able to throttle other services because they can promote their own. While other services lag they can show their service running fine. Also since most areas are a regional monopoly it can be difficult for many to verify why a service is acting funny. I'm reminded when my friends disconnected from a game they enjoyed and they only knew it wasn't the game server because I, on AT&T, at the time wasn't having any issues. They assumed the game servers were crashing.

> ""Netflix’s whole argument is that ISPs are purposely letting their peering points get congested[...]

Actually deep packet throttling independent of peering nodes. In many cases using a VPN would alleviate congestion while utilizing most of the same routing. [By bypassing deep packet inspection in the last mile users saw increased speeds.](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/186576-verizon-caught-throttling-netflix-traffic-even-after-its-pays-for-more-bandwidth) Verizon is using identical deep packet throttling on their unlimited plans currently on video services.",False,False,1519713312.0,97529,3628,1310259055.0,False,True

* No blocking: Gave a right to receive and send any lawful traffic, as well as prohibits the blocking of lawful services, content, applications and devices.
* No prioritization: Prohibited any unreasonable content discriminations to create an even playing field for consumers and creators.
* Mobile Devices: Rules requiring transparency for mobile broadband providers and prohibiting them from blocking websites and certain competitive applications
* Network Transparency: Gave users the right to know their basic performance characteristics and how their Network is being managed
* Network Management: Allowed broadband providers to do reasonable network management as needed
* Vigilance: ""...creates an open Internet advisory committee to assist the commission in monitoring the state of Internet openness and the effects of the rules.""

The spectrum auction conditions and 2010 neutrality provisions were then challenged in court by Verizon. This case ruled in favor of Verizon in 2014 stating that the FCC did not have the authority to enforce such rules because broadband providers such as Verizon were not classified as common carrier.

Thus leading us to the 2015 Open Internet Order which reclassified broadband providers as common carrier's under Title II and implemented much stronger net neutrality rules that we all know.

Please understand that there is a much larger history of this subject than just post 2015 and pre-2015. If you read further back you can learn more about the other reclassification back in 2005 and Michael Powell's non-discrimination principles of Network Freedom.

It's not like ISPs under Net Neutrality provided differening speed plans or throttle net speeds... Oh wait.

Our ISPs may be dickish[still better than what I hear from customer service in the (former)Commonwealth countries] but they still provide a service which makes an attempt to alleviate connection and to oversell bandwidth for compensation.

It all doesn't matter: we surrendered a lot already under the Patriot Act. And you're a naive fool to think you aren't also already being monitored, throttled, or censored(de facto) as well(if not more) in your country

The SESTA plan is a poorly-written law. It has the 'knowledge' requirement. Observers and academics have said that SESTA will fail to work as intended because the 'knowledge' requirement will just cause internet companies to monitor how their services are used less, not more.

SESTA, and what is currently being voted on is FOSTA + SESTA, **will help child traffickers**. From https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180221/23372139282/house-prepared-to-rush-vote-terrible-frankenstein-sesta-which-will-harm-trafficking-victims-internet.shtml

> A recent paper by one of the world's foremost experts on ""intermediary liability,"" Daphne Keller, explains why the bill won't work based on years and years of studying how these kinds of intermediary liability laws work in practice:
> 
> >*SESTA’s confusing language and poor policy choices, combined with platforms’ natural incentive to avoid legal risk, make its likely practical consequences all too clear. It will give platforms reason to err on the side of removing Internet users’ speech in response to any controversy – and in response to false or mistaken allegations, which are often levied against online speech. It will also make platforms that want to weed out bad user generated content think twice, since such efforts could increase their overall legal exposure.*
> 
> And, again, NONE of that does anything to actually go after sex traffickers. 

>As Keller notes in her paper:

>>*SESTA would fall short on both of intermediary liability law’s core goals: getting illegal content down from the Internet, and keeping legal speech up. It may not survive the inevitable First Amendment challenge if it becomes law. That’s a shame. Preventing online sex trafficking is an important goal, and one that any reasonable participant in the SESTA discussion shares. There is no perfect law for doing that, but there are laws that could do better than SESTA -- and with far less harm to ordinary Internet users. Twenty years of intermediary liability lawmaking, in the US and around the world, has provided valuable lessons that could guide Congress in creating a more viable law.*

>But instead of doing that, Congress is pushing through with something that doesn't even remotely attempt to fix the problems, but bolts together two totally separate problematic bills and washes its hands of the whole process. And, we won't even bother getting into the procedural insanity of this suddenly coming to the House floor for a vote early next week, despite the Judiciary Committee only voting for FOSTA, but not this SESTA-clone amendment.

SESTA+FOSTA is a bad fucking law, brought to us by idiot policymakers who just want an easy 'anti-sex-trafficking' political win. Their ham-fisted attempts to appear righteous have done irreparable harm to the LE fight against sex trafficking. Backpages, before it was browbeat by congressional harassment, responded to law enforcement subpoenas about every potential sex ad hosted on its service.

Already people get the vapors when sites don't aggressively censor comments for unpopular content. Pretty soon it might seem strange and reckless not to.  It's cute though because it's not technically prior restraint.

As for effectiveness, I'm not an expert but those who are say this bill would be at *best* counterproductive.

Take a look at Backpage.  They used to have a section for adult entertainment: the implication was obvious, but AFAIK the ads followed the letter of the law or were removed.  Then they started getting prosecuted anyway.  Now *every* section is adult entertainment.  Want a date?  Prostitutes.  Need a massage?  Prostitutes.  Buying a lawnmower?  Prostitutes.  And I have to imagine it's harder to police having everything scattered than concentrated in one place.

I'm British, and I'm not a legal expert, but as far as I can tell, it only affects those sites that operate ""with the intent to promote or facilitate"" child trafficking and prostitution.  The change to the CDA is basically just to exempt anyone who explicitly breaks the child prostitution code (again, wilfully and with intent, as is made explicit in the proposition) from absolute protection.

In the case of most site operators, this seems to only affect them if they are wilfully allowing content that encourages child trafficking and prostitution - that is, images that are explicitly obtained in this way, and encourage further action.  I think a website that is comfortable hosting child pornography is not really a website that I want to be around.

Free market is still the best choice, and the internet deserves to still kind of have that ""final frontier"", or if you will, a ""wild wild west"" atmoshphere for as long as humanly possible.

Until americans reign in our government after letting it go to shit for so many decades and decades, theres no reason to do this. For instance, both my phone and broadband bills combined, (Verizon and charter) is less than $90 a month, and I get great service from both.

Second of all, the Russian conspiracy theory pushed by (literally) INSANE liberal mainstream media outlets is really getting old and boring. The democrat party lost the 2016 elections really really badly because of pushing shitty corrupt candidates and instead of admitting they need to reform their party, the blame has been shifted and directed at a conspiracy theory. It's been quiet pathetic and sad to watch, and I can't believe this is what america has become to be completely honest.

A year of investigating by a group of corrupt democrats has been a shitshow. Jeff Sessions even handed them control of the DOJ for no reason, and its been a total farce and has found nothing and more importantly done nothing but kept gullible liberals held in a state of suspended disbelief to try to rally them around this conspiracy theory. Its a JOKE.

In conclusion, I like to generally consider myself politically independent and a centrist, and I am very in tune with the reality that many conspiracies are very real, but in all seriousness, a lot of people on the left side of the political spectrum have lost their goddammed minds, and the 2018 midterms are going to be another huge loss for them if they try to keep these charades going.",False,False,1519716393.0,7714,3211,1515158057.0,False,False

So in 2015, the FCC decided to classify ISPs as common carriers which put them under title 2, and meant that the FCC could *continue* to enforce NN rules.

Many of the things in here were bandwidth related, which was the primary question between Netflix and Comcast. Who has to pay for additional infrastructure requirements when bandwidth consumes too much (do you know how much streaming video consumes?)

The AT&T issues mentioned were not addressed by Net Neutrality, so I will assume the author is either biased, ignorant or stupid. Neither was Windstream's abuse. So half of these have absolutely nothing to do with Net Neutrality. In fact, quite a few others have nothing to do with neutrality. So a lot of red herrings in there.

The author also did poor research on Netflix, as it puts it as a 2014 issue. And it way oversimplifies things. Comcast noticed that Netflix was consuming far more than any other service and well beyond the agreements for the public connection into their network, so they pushed bandwidth back to the agreed on levels. Netflix got customer complaints and negotiated with Comcast to pay for larger, private entrances into Comcasts network, giving them a paid for advantage. It was not ""fast lane/slow lane"".

Disagree? That is fine. But do a little research before spouting off. A three second Google search proves nice Google Fu skills, but does very little to show you understand the subject.

Do I like Comcast? No. Do I think they are above abuse? No. Do I agree that Netflix, a giant, should force the public to pay for bigger doors into the castle because they got fat eating too much? No. And, the most important ... Do I think the legislation was designed to keep the net neutral? I not only think that, I know that.

That has never been the case. The core issue Google jumped on was Netflix buying bigger doors, largely after their acquisition of YouTube, which is also a huge hog.

A lot of what you say is the potential for a problem that Net Neutrality was supposedly designed to solve. But it did not. I am willing to get behind someone trying to create truly neutral legislation that supports all businesses, but that is not what this is. 

As for you link, you just revomited the same bits. MOST of the bits were not addressed by Net Neutrality legislation, as it passed. The core of Net Neutrality focused on wording that protected big business from paying extra for consuming more. Disagree? Do some serious research.

(Sec. 2) This bill expresses the sense of Congress that section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 was not intended to provide legal protection to websites that unlawfully promote and facilitate prostitution and contribute to sex trafficking. Section 230 limits the legal liability of interactive computer service providers or users for content they publish that was created by others.

(Sec. 3) The bill amends the federal criminal code to add a new section that imposes penalties—a fine, a prison term of up to 10 years, or both—on a person who uses or operates (or attempts to use or operate) a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.

Additionally, it establishes enhanced penalties—a fine, a prison term of up to 25 years, or both—for a person who uses or operates a facility of interstate or foreign commerce to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person in one of the following aggravating circumstances: (1) promoting or facilitating the prostitution of five or more persons, or (2) acting with reckless disregard that such conduct contributes to sex trafficking.

A court must order mandatory restitution, in addition to other criminal or civil penalties.

A person injured by an aggravated offense may recover damages and attorneys' fees in a federal civil action.

A defendant may assert, as an affirmative defense, that the promotion or facilitation of prostitution is legal in the jurisdiction where it was targeted.

(Sec. 4) The bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit construing section 230 to limit state criminal charges for conduct: (1) that promotes or facilitates prostitution in violation of this bill, or (2) that constitutes child sex trafficking.

(Sec. 5) Additionally, it prohibits construing this bill to limit federal or state civil actions or criminal prosecutions that are not preempted by section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934.

The real issue isn't small blogs and personal stuff. That's a red herring. As the website grows, it's going to have to develop tech and infrastructure to deal with the increasing volume. Large companies have that stuff in place already (see YouTube's tech that will detect copyrighted or inappropriate content. While not perfect, it's a great way to prove due diligence). Small website's can do it manually since volume is small.

Growing websites on the other hand are going to have another place to spend money to save money in the long run, as the volume will outpace what they can moderate manually. In the past you could just let things go. Now you would need to do enough to prove that you aren't just ignoring illegal content to save money (and draw users). 

Then again it opens up an entire other market. I could design and sell the tools to implement on your website to help pare down the cost of moderating manually. Mind you Facebook already does this kinda by trading user info for allowing the use of the Facebook comment section at the bottom of the page.

So yea, this law honestly doesn't affect the little guys or the big guys, and pretty minorly hits the growing companies by swapping their priorities around a little bit. 

Who does this affect?

Unethical human experimentation in the United States describes numerous experiments performed on human test subjects in the United States that have been considered unethical, and were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, consent, or informed consent of the test subjects. Such tests have occurred throughout American history, but particularly in the 20th century.

The experiments include: the exposure of people to chemical and biological weapons (including infection of people with deadly or debilitating diseases), human radiation experiments, injection of people with toxic and radioactive chemicals, surgical experiments, interrogation and torture experiments, tests involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of ""medical treatment"".

](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/30-small-isps-urge-ajit-pai-to-preserve-title-ii-and-net-neutrality-rules/) Essentially a large ISP can force a service to pay money by saying they can't access the ISP's customers unless they pay up. This can be done by blocking or throttling without net neutrality in place. An ISP can also form partnerships with competing sites and services to degrade a site's performance making other products look better. This can all be done with zero transparency to customers or competitors who can only make claims and potentially get sued for libel since they have no way to back up their claims since it's done behind closed doors. Net neutrality forces transparent metering and puts the choice within consumers on what services they want rather than allowing ISPs to influence or make that choice.

Net neutrality promotes competition from websites on the Internet independent of their ability to pay to access customers beyond the bandwidth they pay their own ISP. I work with many web services and by purchasing bandwidth I can access services and form partnerships online and in turn other companies can work with me with minimal investment. Those services in turn purchase bandwidth from their ISPs. Without Net Neutrality an ISP is allowed to gatekeep via throttling or blocking services without any transparency (see net metering transparency). Large ISPs are then allowed to form partnerships and dictate the winners online to their customers leveraging them to sell access to businesses they work with. Many businesses and residential customers have little choice with ISPs making this extremely powerful for the ISP.

When ISPs litigated and tried to destroy NN the FCC reclassified them and rather than doing things case by case they set the restrictions in writing. Hopefully that makes sense.

So before 2015 it was already understood on a case by case basis that an ISP could not throttle or block sites they disagreed with, nor could they create partnerships to give advantages to services or sites. ISPs and the FCC know how profitable and how much control that would give ISPs.

The concept that people have a few ISPs and that they can say an online store is accessible or not was easy to see as horrible.

I don't know your background, but I'll assume pure Libertarian ideology. That you believe ISPs, even regional monopolies or full monopolies, should have complete control of their product (routing of data through them). It's unlikely I can change your mind or get you to believe that Title II was only used to enforce the three parts of NN. That the regulation was in fact fairly light and upholding previous rulings made on a case by case basis. To me removing net neutrality is potentially destroying the greater free market online in return for upholding a much smaller regionally monopolistic and fairly utility-based market. That said I'd understand if you adhered to a pure free market approach that even monopolies should exist no matter how harmful and it's up to customers to make the choice.

More practical, less ideologically pure, viewpoints would argue that an ISP is a near regional monopoly and are destructive. Without the ability to break them up the next best alternative is to ensure that small ISPs can compete and that online companies don't have to go through every regional ISP to access customers.

Without net neutrality a large ISP can leverage their customers against services online which sounds amazing for the ISP, but is horrible for customers and services trying to access the ISP's customers. Rather than customers paying for bandwidth and accessing the free market online they instead go through the ISP and their partnerships first which decide how much of the bandwidth they purchased can go to individual sites if at all.

With net neutrality customers buy bandwidth and choose which services and businesses they interact with. The ISP is merely a middleman take out of the equation for the benefit of the free market online.

It's even better with our new National Broadband Network, where the network itself is owned by a government-operated corporation that leases access to the network to companies.

In America, by contrast, it is *normal* to have only one option for landline ISP, and like three or four mobile telcos.

But I also didn't say that net neutrality was unnecessary. Just that lacking it is *less* of a problem where there is true competition. We still have companies zero-rating a lot of content here which puts competitors of the zero-rated content at a disadvantage. It gives Spotify an unfair advantage over YouTube Music/Google Play and Apple Music, for example. Competition provides some protection from much more grievous infractions of net neutrality, as long as the ISPs and/or telcos aren't colluding or don't all instantly jump on the bandwagon after one does it.

Whether throttling that traffic was legal or not, whether it was a dick move or not, it's clear that ISPs stood to actually gain some benefit by cutting down the amount of p2p traffic going across their lines.

Today, because almost all internet users regularly visit sites that send substantially more data compared to 2006, p2p traffic is [only about 3%](https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2017/06/01/the-long-slow-decline-of-bittorrent/).

But if you want to go back to 90s internet, I guess that's a valid opinion.

Net Neutrality isn't gone just because the FCC said so. They took a vote to change the rules back in November. Early last week, the new rules were added to the Federal Register. The rules have a 60 day period for Congress to do a Congressional Review (if Congress wants to halt the rules) before they finally get put in effect. TL;DR: ""Nothing has changed"" because legally, nothing has changed yet. 

Finally, yes. Yes I do know what was in the text of the Net Neutrality rules. In fact, let me go find it and post it here for you. [Here](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-open-internet-order) is a link to it, just in case you want to verify what I'm saying.

>Because the record overwhelmingly supports adopting rules and demonstrates that three 
specific practices invariably harm the open Internet**—Blocking, Throttling, and Paid Prioritization—this 
Order bans each of them**, applying the same rules to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access 
service.

It goes on further to describe what ""blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization"" is. And explicitly says not to do it.

If you take a look at TechDirt and other sites, the ""intent"" at play with SESTA and FOSTA is something like this:

>State Attorney Generals are pissed off about CDA 230. In general, they want to be free to bully Google et al with state laws. This is counter to the philosophy that has allowed the web to grow; it is much easier to comply with one set of federal laws (and all international laws) than state AND federal laws.

>State Attorney Generals are beat back in their over attacks against CDA 230, because it is economically irrational to get rid of CDA 230. Momentarily stymied, they quickly fasten onto child sex trafficking as the 'horrible' to champion their irrational crusade -- because a lot of things can be excused in the fight against child sex trafficking.

>This appears to trigger congressional interest or collusion, where a bunch of techno-luddites attack Craigslist and Backpage, abusing their congressional investigatory powers to create public spectacles of entities that hitherto were quieting complying with law enforcement. It is almost without question that these unnecessary hearings gave traffickers greater notice of Craigslit/Backpage's subpoena compliance. They were only catching stupid people that way, but now the stupid people have been warned.

>Congressional interest is further warped by special interest groups that are trying to get rid of important first amendment protections for morality reasons. Basically, they hate porn and don't think anyone should be able to enjoy it. SESTA+FOSTA is the first part of a whole cascade of efforts that could seriously damage the prominence of legal speech on the internet.

>tl;dr SESTA+FOSTA is the result of stupid vote-hungry policymakers being manipulated by vote-hungry attorney generals (or their own initiative) and being pushed along this path by worthless anti-first amendment moralists to produce a shitty law that will categorically damage the people it purports to aide. Some of these new, additional victims will definitely be children. SESTA+FOSTA does nothing to help victims, it only aides the perpetrators of these vile acts.

And you shouldn't be expecting rational or even-handed application of the law when the law in question involves sex trafficking. Being moderate on that issue will definitely kill your career.

>There was a lot of sentiment from young tech heads that they were being screwed because their ISP was wanting to charge extra for Netflix or other streaming services.  Net Neutrality, at its root, says ""all bits are equal"" and they can't charge you more for one service's bits.  But they can charge you what it costs them to provide those bits and they can meter how many bits you use.  Simply, they're going to have to charge what it costs them or go out of business, and if they don't charge enough, they can't get enough money to build out infrastructure for the Next Big Thing (Netflix 4K?).  By the looks of it, we'll all be having metered internet services in the next few years.  


It's not clear to me how this is anti-net neutrality - if anything it appears to be pro-net neutrality because it is saying that the alleged problem of bandwidth hogging can be solved with net neutrality regulations, i.e discriminatory pricing is not necessary to drive increased investment. The particularly relevant part is

>Net Neutrality, at its root, says ""all bits are equal"" and they can't charge you more for one service's bits.  But **they can charge you what it costs them to provide those bits** and they can meter how many bits you use.


So basically we don't need to scrap net neutrality to solve the ""Netflix problem.""

Onto the next quote in this disjointed Frankenstein of a comment:

>Naturally, many of these same people are also implying that because Netflix has to pay Comcast, consumers will foot the bill for this as Netflix will have to charge more for their service. This could not be further from the truth. Those stating this have no clue how Netflix delivers their content today or what costs they already incur. If they did, they would know this is not a new cost to Netflix, it’s simply paying a different provider, and it should be at a lower cost. It should actually be cheaper for Netflix to buy direct from Comcast, and they also get an SLA, which also improves quality and that’s a good thing. Given that Netflix has many options to buy transit from many different transit providers, why would they pay more? They wouldn’t.


Obviously I can't access any of the context of this quote but it appears to be a misunderstanding of net-neutrality. There is nothing that prohibits Comcast from offering CDN services - i[n fact they have done so for several years](http://www.lightreading.com/video/content-delivery-network-\(cdn\)/comcast-debuts-cdn-as-video-eats-the-world/d/d-id/718386) under net-neutrality. If it were true that 
>It should actually be cheaper for Netflix to buy direct from Comcast

then I am sure Netflix would gladly use Comcast CDN in order to reduce costs and therefore increase profits.

And the final block of text:

>Most seem to be giving Netflix a pass, with very few demanding real transparency into what’s taking place, or changed, that degraded Netflix performance back in September 2013. No company should try and force us to take their word for it, they should simply make the data public and let us decide on our own. Netflix says they are bringing transparency to the debate, but they are doing the opposite by using vague and high level terms with no definition. To date, Netflix has yet to set forth any details on how they want the current business models to change, how it should be regulated, what they consider “strong” net neutrality or even submitted a proposal to the FCC.""

>""It was Netflix that specifically chose transit paths to those ISPs who refused to give it free peering that it knew (and measured) were not capable of handling an increase in load. In some cases I was told by ISPs that traffic levels increased by 500% in only a few months where normal Internet growth with these same peers was less than 20-30% across an entire year. These ISPs’ customers did not request traffic to be served from poorly performing paths. Netflix chose to create, and use, paths that they knew were congested, simply because they were cheaper than using paths that were less congested. While some may not like that decision, Netflix is running a business and like all businesses, cost is a factor in a lot of decisions. I’m fine with Netflix having to make tradeoffs between quality and cost, but it’s not true that 100% of every path going into Comcast was “congested”.

Voters are too easily swayed and misinformed to be able to reliably have a clue what their representative is doing, which they really only have to look up once every two years. But they're also informed enough to vote directly on complex hundreds-page long legislation on a regular basis?

Voters being easily swayed and misinformed is literally the exact argument *for* representative democracy.

As far as I'm aware, our representatives don't even do that, they have technical experts distill the concepts and have a team to draft a bill.

There is so much wrong with this that it is difficult to pick where to start.

* *Even though* congressmen have experts distilling bills into concepts for them, these distillations are still oftentimes too complex for the average American to fully understand. You can simplify something like the tax bill that passed last year as much as you want, but by the time you get to the point that the average person will understand it, it'll be oversimplified beyond usefulness.

* Even though congressmen have people to simplify and distill bills into concepts for them, they still need to have working knowledge over how the actual bill works and all of its ramifications. Not just the summary. It's easier to expect this over someone whose full time job is to review law than an average citizen.

* Personal experts and staffers for an individual congressman are designed to inform them so they can make an educated vote. Experts and staffers aimed at the general public will invariably be used to try to *convince* them how to vote.

* The most compelling arguments from ""experts"" that work on average laypeople might not actually be the correct arguments, but they will *always* win under this system

* This does literally nothing to address the fact that states with large populations will functionally dictate all of US policy and people living in small states will have no representation 

* This does nothing to address the fact that it is easier to mislead a large group of idiots than a small group of vetted citizens

* This does nothing to address the fact that the average American has no idea how the law works. So laws passed under this system are bound to be riddled with easily abusable loopholes, constitutional violations, unintended conflicts with existing law, unintended logical conclusions based on the law, etc.

> As it stands, we have ""trolls"" electing representatives which might as well be special interests themselves (special interest of making money and not putting their necks out). 

This is actually the perfect argument against direct democracy. You'd much rather this than the trolls writing the laws of the land themselves. At least with this, it'd be hard for them to convince people to elect someone who is as bad as they would be at writing legislation. 

And with this, there are hard limits on their influence. Because where they are less populous, they can elect fewer representatives. And if they are disparate enough, they can't elect any. Even though, if we had a direct democracy system, this same group would have a lot more influence on the law.

> I say we roll out a system like this on a smaller scale, maybe in small towns/cities, and see how it fares.

It actually is implemented in some towns, and works out okay there. The problems arise when you scale it up to a national level and involve an order of magnitude more people. Then the cracks from misinformation, disinformation, and misleading come in.

This is why national refferendums are bad policy. Brexit, for example, happened largely because special interests lied to enough people about how good it was going to be, and they believed the lie.

I get it, friend. And you can continue to do you. Every law we have today and every law we will have going forward is made by these people. That is the country I live in and if I were to completely distrust it and those running it I would hate my life here. Luckily even if that were the case, as it may be for you, the option to leave the country is always a real one. It is not within my power or responsibility to ensure law officials and enforcement use the law as it has been intended. I am an engineer and not in law for a reason. 

I do however support getting news from the source and not a Tech Blog. That's just how I am I guess. I read over the [text of HR 1865 here] (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865/text). It does seem wordy and like it's got some bloat but the intent is crystal clear to me. But I am just one person. I am sure if you asked a million people how they feel you'd be split about 50/50 like everything else. 

This thing is not going to get rid of CDA 230 and it seems silly to lie and say it is. If someone is afraid that the US government is corrupt and will abuse the laws they have at their disposal in order to for some reason attack social media sites like facebook and reddit then just say that. If you think that laws being introduced are making it harder for small/startup websites and companies, say that. If you don't think sex trafficking is as large an issue in the US as it is being made out, or that it is enforced just fine as it is, then you can say that as well. Have your own opinion and hopefully people will respect it. For me that is the best approach. You really don't need to spam people on Reddit with single sourced copy-pasta. It's not going to gain you and your friends support.

I do hope that your guys' rally works out as best it can and that you all feel better for it.

You get one pedophile (or cat) and then suddenly there's about a hundred images cached, and you can never get rid of all of it. A non-CP example may help you understand this problem:

I had one or two selfies of my butt on my computer's image directory when I upgraded to Windows 10. Of course WIN 10 has a feature where it aggregates content from image directories and puts a slideshow of the content on the start menu as a link to the picture manager. So guess what starts displaying whenever I open my start menu? The butt selfie. So, I scour my image directory, and it takes hours. I delete every copy of the butt selfies that I could find, and I get like, 3 copies. I don't know how the hell I had three copies on there. But I got them. So, I check my start menu... And the icon rotates back around to the butt selfie.

A few hours more of searching, and I'm fairly certain that I had gotten them all. Open start menu? Oh, hello, my butt.

And this is just a simple image folder.

I haven't even gotten into what may or may not be construed as ""CP"" in the contexts of this legislation. There's been a lot of attempts to label animated and non-real content as CP, and no valid legal challenge has been allowed against those overreaches because everyone the law was used to attack conveniently had some real CP somewhere on their drives (again, never mind that the stuff is like cat hair). Is it any clip of anime that shows a panty shot of a little girl? Because that's like, at least half of them. Would Rick and Morty qualify? There's literally a scene of a child getting attacked by a child molester in there. What about My Little Pony porn? The ponies are ""high school age"" after all. Not to mention about how much porn there is of Spike (who is literally a *baby* dragon).

That's literally false. And if you're talking about inflation dollars, it's still misleading at best. Yeah, the country did ""just fine"", but there were *a lot* of things outside of minimum wage that caused this to be the case.

Meanwhile, if you look at every study on a sharp increase in the minimum wage or if you crack open any economics textbook, you'll learn that it's typically always a bad thing unless it was really low to begin with. 

If you artificially increase the value of labor above the natural market price, it will have negative effects. And these negative effects will often outweigh the benefits.

> It's getting the dark money out of politics. We have two right wing parties in this country, each selling a twist on the same agenda. It's no wonder people don't understand progressives, when both parties have been spreading so much misinformation.

So this is what you're gonna do? You're just gonna sit here and lie about the Democratic Party? 

Getting dark money out of politics was literally Hillary Clinton's main deal, which she talked about all the time before she even ran. Getting dark money out of politics has been a universal Democrat Party position ever since Citizens United. 

Pretending that both parties are the same and only ""Progressives"" want dark money out of politics is just a lie. Plain and simple.

> Ask yourself this. With all the compounding productivity gains of the last 50 years, why does everyone seem to just passively accept that we should be making due with less and less?

You shouldn't. It's just that artificially increasing the value of labor by increasing the minimum wage is not a solution to the problem, as the problems that creates outpaces any benefits.

If raising the minimum wage to $100/hr would make everyone rich we'd do it, but that's not how it works.

> There was a time when an unskilled highschool graduate could raise a family on a single income. What changed?

Unions dissolved, Tax dollars got spent on the military instead of raising the American people, Universities started charging silly amounts of money, unskilled labor is worth less because robots can do a lot of stuff now, the population of unskilled laborers grew faster than the jobs so they could get away with paying less.

It's necessary because it's so hard to bread into the ISP market—practically nobody has the massive resources and political clout necessary to build out the infrastructure, and those who do aren't interested.

So you're left with a situation where ISPs are local monopolies and there's nothing you can do about it.

Net Neutrality says ""hey, maybe we shouldn't let these monopolies fuck over everyone completely"" and forces them to treat all traffic as equal, whether it comes from your blog or Facebook or Netflix. It stops ISPs from absusing their monopolies to extort consumers and websites for more money that they really don't need. What it doesn't stop is, say, price increases. If your ISP is struggling to modernize, they can still raise prices. This does nothing to stop that. This just makes sure that every website you try to visit is allowed to use all the bandwidth you pay for, and makes sure that you can use all the bandwidth you pay for on whatever you want without having to pay anything extra.

And for the record, ISP level isn't even where removing net neutrality could actually help the internet. The ISP basically just handles last-mile delivery of content; the internet backbone is where being able to prioritize different kinds of traffic could really help and the backbone companies aren't part of the push against net neutrality.

If you think that laws being introduced are making it harder for small/startup websites and companies, say that.

You appear to have conflated my statements with those of every single other participant in this thread. I never said it was going to get rid of CDA 230. I said that SESTA+FOSTA exists because people hate CDA 230 for a variety of reasons, most of them selfish and short-sighted. SESTA -will- create an exception for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking, so CDA 230's protections -will- be reduced, and the threat surface liability for online services will be vastly expanded on the state law level. It also will create huge liability barriers to entry -- that's also true, and people have testified before congress to that effect, but I didn't mention that in my previous statements.

> If you don't think sex trafficking is as large an issue in the US as it is being made out, or that it is enforced just fine as it is, then you can say that as well.

There are plenty of ways to undercut the statistics cited by supporters of this bill, and yes, they're mostly garbage. I didn't reference any of that in my previous statements.

**My main problem with this bill is that it will help sex traffickers and hurt everyone else.** The effects of limiting CDA 230 will create general harm to free speech on the internet. Insisting on the knowledge requirement will limit coordination between law enforcement and private industry in combating this problem. People have testified before Congress to this effect.

This is a really common misunderstanding. A lot of the high bandwidth hate from them is not at the peering nodes at all. It's actually at the last mile hubs that some ISPs have [oversold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling#Internet_Networks) to great degrees.

You've fallen for the hype rather than facts.

> TV-like bundles

There's no evidence that they would do this. Indeed it would actually likely reduce their profits. It costs them almost nothing to provide access to most popular websites or the unpopular web sites. (That famous fake poster is the biggest example of the absurdity of it.) IF they were to bundle it, they'd charge extra for the biggest data users like Youtube or Netflix. Reddit itself has nothing to worry about because it's traffic is so low comparatively. It's cheap to send large quantities of text.

> slow lanes

Again there's no reason to do this. Even if they were to do this, it's not like you're thinking. Most of the time of the day there is massive excess capacity so slowing down anything doesn't make sense. During peak times is what networks need to scale for and in these cases they could indeed slow down ""lower priority"" traffic, but this would only be to allow ""higher priority"" traffic to go through, namely things like live streaming that people want to avoid having buffered. Indeed, they likely already do this without you knowing about it. I'd rather my pages of text take a couple extra moments to load than to have my videos be stuck in buffering constantly.

> censorship

If you're worried about censorship why do you want to hand control over to a government agency? They're the ones most likely to censor. FCC could block criticism of Net Neutrality, for example.

> The Internet is a much better place with Net Neutrality than without

How do you know that? What hardships have you faced from lack of Net Neutrality? How do you know the future in what benefits could come from opening up more competition in ISPs?

> Not that I believe ISPs would actually reduce their customers' bills just because their own costs went down.

The money goes somewhere. If it doesn't go to reducing the customers' bills then it will go to increasing the share price and giving money to share holders (which you can join in on) or it will go to investing in infrastructure to give better service at the same price. Why is this not a good thing?

> they're basically all monopolies already.

Yes, many local governments, primarily those in Blue states or heavily Blue areas, have made deals with the ISPs to fix their prices while guaranteeing monopoly access. Local governments also block competitors from using government owned infrastructure if its not the majority player. Google Fiber faced this problem heavily.

What we have now is a moderate right wing negotiating with a radical right wing.  That is not how you negotiate to a moderate position.  I actually consider myself slightly right of center, but our government has drifted so far right economically that we need some strong left wing representation.

> So this is what you're gonna do? You're just gonna sit here and lie about the Democratic Party?  ... Getting dark money out of politics was literally Hillary Clinton's main deal ... since Citizens United.

And there's the rub.  Do you really think the corporate takeover of Washington began with Citizens united?  That decision was a travesty, but it's only real effect was to lock in the system that was already in place.  Focusing on Citizens United was a ruse.

> Pretending that both parties are the same

Yes, that would be.  Good thing I didn't do it.  They are not the same, and we would be tremendously better off with the Democrats in control.  You are overstating my position to make it seem like I am far more radical than I am.  Now *that* is a lie.

I didn't even say that *only* progressives want that.  Across the country, citizens want the money out - no matter what their leaning.  But within the power centers of both parties, and across the vast majority of office holders, that is not the case.  Trump ran on getting money out of politics.  I presume you didn't believe him.

> You shouldn't. It's just that artificially increasing the value of labor by increasing the minimum wage is not a solution to the problem, as the problems that creates outpaces any benefits.

This is mostly false.  We hear it almost as much as trickle down economics.  When we actually give tax breaks to the rich, or raise the minimum wage, the sky doesn't fall.  But again, this isn't a big issue for me.  I see it as a weak band-aid.  I also wouldn't assume you are wrong about doubling it overnight, I just don't see that happening.

> Unions dissolved, Tax dollars got spent on the military instead of raising the American people, Universities started charging silly amounts of money, unskilled labor is worth less because robots can do a lot of stuff now, the population of unskilled laborers grew faster than the jobs so they could get away with paying less.

I agree across the board.  Progressives stand directly opposed to the first half.  The second half is an unavoidable market reality, so the question is, what are we going to do about it.  Half of the human race will never achieve above average intelligence by definition.

And none of this explains why we have had to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations, and shred our safety nets.  With all the efficiencies we have gained from computers, robotics, a better educated populous, and cheap offshore labor, we should be able to provide a little better lives for ourselves.

> The world where you can make a good living as a high school grad raising a family on a single income is gone and will never come back.

Then none of this matters.  AI is coming around the corner that will eliminate half of the jobs that remain in the next 20 years (+-10 depending on who you ask) and it's all downhill from there.

Nothing can hurt their profits, because the big ones are all monopolies. None of this shit would be nearly so frightening if the people *actually* had their choice of ISPs, but they don't.

Of *course* there's reason to do this! Ripping off their customers is a long-held ISP tradition. If they can force you to pay more for the same service they're already offering, why *wouldn't* they do that? Because, again, *they have no competition*.

>We *are* reinstating old rules

Alright sonny, check this out.

So back in 2007 / 2008 when Comcast was blocking BitTorrent, the FCC stepped in to enforce their Net Neutrality rules. In 2009, the FCC started discussing the [Open Internet Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_Open_Internet_Order_2010) rules that they were trying to pass. (And eventually did pass, except modified). In response, [Comcast sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_Corp._v._FCC).

It was basically a lawsuit of whether or not the FCC had the authority to regulate the network management practices of ISPs. The FCC argued that they did have authority. Comcast argued that they didn't.

>The Court relied on a two-part test for ancillary authority, laid out in Am. Library Ass'n v. FCC. A commission may exercise ancillary authority only if “(1) the Commission's general jurisdictional granted under **Title I** [of the Communications Act] covers the regulated subject and (2) the regulations are reasonably ancillary to the Commission's effective performance of its statutorily mandated responsibilities.”

The courts actually agreed that the FCC didn't have the authority to regulate ISPs under Title I, because the FCC didn't really satisfy the part 2 of the test in the quote above. Eventually, the FCC released the modified version of the Open Internet Order mentioned earlier. And in response, [Verizon Sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_\(2014\)).

Once again, the argument was whether or not the FCC had the authority to impose rules upon ISPs which the FCC had classified as Broadband Providers (which falls under Title I, where the FCC doesn't have much jurisdiction) rather than Common Carriers (which falls under Title II, where the FCC has a much bigger jurisdiction). And the courts agreed with Verizon. Two rules were struck down from the Open Internet Order.

>Of the three orders that make up the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, two were vacated (no blocking and no unreasonable discrimination) and one was upheld (transparency).

In response, the FCC considered 2 ideas. One was permit fast and slow lanes. The other was to reclassify ISPs as common carriers, under Title II. They asked for public comment (and got a record setting response). They decided upon the latter on February 26, 2015.

-----

So what's the take away? Well

The FCC had been enforcing Net Neutrality rules under Title I *until* Verizon v. FCC in 2014. The result of the case was that the FCC had no jurisdiction to impose rules on ISPs as long as they were classified under Title I.

There is no ""going back to pre-2015"", because the courts have determined that what the FCC was doing (Title I with FCC rules) is not legal. We are entering completely new territory right now. Not ""pre-2015"" territory.

Edit: if you disagree with the idea of Net Neutrality as a whole, that's fine. But don't act like we're going back to the way it was. It was never this way before.",False,False,False,103066,6209,1456652536.0,False,True

Before government regulation, there were literally corporation towns where employees were only paid in money that could be spent at the company store.  Your argument is that we should ignore history, and remove the only regulatory body that has ever passed regulations to protect citizens and consumers.  Can government be manipulated and do things that hurt Americans?  Absolutely.  Can corporations do the same thing without government intervention?  Well, history says yes, they have and they can.  So no, I don't see where you are coming from.  

Let's look at the environmental regulations as arguments.  If we were to take away power from the government to regulate the way corporations dump their waste, do you really think that these companies are going to use more expensive procedures and processes to protect the environment out of their own good will?   If we look at history, and events like [the Cuyahoga River Fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River) then logic would dictate that corporations will happily cut corners to save money at the expense of public health and safety.  

So, if you can look at the historical evidence and still believe that corporations do not have the ability to greatly damage the livelihood of the average American...

So you do support Nazi's on Reddit. Glad we cleared that up.

>Then what is it?

This is regardless of usage you pay the same. Netflix serve all the bandwidth they want and they pay the same as the website as no name website that gets one person. That's unfair and biased to corporations, which shocker, support this rule.

>What's contradictory? Actually. Serious question. It costs the same to print hate as it does love. No-one has to read either. Where is the discrepancy. Answer.

1. It's not proper English.

2. Being reasonable and exploitative (""don't take more for no reason"" and ""Get what you can from everyone"") are mutually exclusive.

3. That's not capitalism.

>Please do.

You want me to answer the question I asked you? Are you reading at this point or just pretending to?

>Resorting to insults, sweet. I knew it would happen. Not saying you're a shill, suggesting you don't understand English, because you don't get what I'm saying. 

Russian to English translation is just a normal not insult right? Term of endearment. You're not good at walking back insults my friend.

>And I stand by that, and you've doubled down on not understanding. You're saying I don't get equality, I do. 

I've doubled down on understanding telecommunications regulations and reading the actual rules instead of relying on someone else to whip me into a fever. Also when did I say you didn't get equality? Cause my search brings up zero results. 

>Everyone has the right to create, no-one has the requirement to read. If I make a shit website, no-one has to go to it. If there's no hits in a month,m that's my problem, not the law's.

Agreed, so why should Facebook pay the same as your shitty website to ISP's?

>The point of NN is to make an even playing ground exist. NN is GOOD. I want NN. Have you gotten the opposite opinion from what I said? I want cunts to have the ability to make their shitty points.

The point of NN is to cover two points. First is to normalize speed and enforcement of it. NN exists because the Wheeler FCC couldn't sue Verizon successfully without Title II. Judge told them explicitly how to get a ruling in their favor. Normalizing speed refers to not artificially lower speed because you're using more. So when ISP's ask for higher rates for higher usage from corporations, that's fair. Not under NN. Under NN, Facebook pays the same to an ISP as you do. If they want to launch a big new live video streaming service with cloud backup. Still pay the same. Second is the requirement of parity in access. Every ISP is required to provide access to every site at the rate the website can operate at. So if you want to start an ISP under NN, you need to be able to serve your own shitty website and Youtube. You can not provide smaller, specialized packages at cheaper rates. You can not block DDOS, malware distribution networks, or troll farms. That's NN. A rule of reactionary policies to allow the FCC to continue to sue companies that violated the rules.

>Look at the current system. People are making big things out of small things. They've been able to make small things because they had opportunities. Opportunities that anit-NN regulation would allow to be squeezed out. NN has allowed good things to grow.

So two years of data overrules two decades of data? What ""opportunities"" exist under NN that wouldn't under deregulation? I'm really confused this one since you're arguing that more rules create more freedom, which is counter intuitive. 

>Nope. One thing the internet does great is educate people. Check what an allegory is. It's readily available. Thanks to NN. Facts aren't susceptible to gatekeeping, you can actually check this.

""a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one."" Wow, that's so different from what I said! /s

NN doesn't dictate content. NN also doesn't the dictionary I own or the Public Library.

>Level 3 English. Look up Allegory. Please. You can say I don't understand, but please double check first. I often do, when I don't sometimes I get called out. I'll be blunt here. When you called me out, I double checked. It's not allegory.

Might want to check again.

>Google, DuckDuckGo, etc. Right there. You can look up what Allegory is. I know it's embarrassing, but if you admit that it's not allegory, I'm willing to accept the humility and keep the conversation going,. I'm sure I have things to learn. What an allegory is, isn't one of them though. Also, metaphors don't have to be a figure of speech, just a comparison that's not explicitly called out as such, as opposed to a simile, which is explicit.

""a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.""

In doing so, the Commission found it necessary to forbear from enforcing the “vast majority of rules adopted under Title II,” including “30 statutory provisions[,]” and to render “over 700 codified rules inapplicable.” The Commission adopted no-blocking, no-throttling, and no- paid-prioritization rules, as well as a general Internet conduct standard and “enhancements” to the transparency rule. In 2016, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Title II Order in United States Telecom Ass’n v. FCC, with the D.C.

I'm going to explain something to you — it's okay to be white. It's okay to be proud of being white. Just like it's fine to be proud of being black or asian.

Actually, make that two. https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6nakns/ajit_pai_not_concerned_about_number_of_pronet/dk9171x/ ",False,False,False,51592,6933,1389387465.0,False,True
3097,12jb69,dux2i2m,t1_duwycpq,t3_80jsi9,1519756882.0,1,"Why are you so sure none of this will happen? Let's walk through the logical steps here.

1. *The purpose of a capitalist business is to make money.* There's really not much to debate here. This is kinda the definition of capitalism. By extension, it is reasonable to say that if their purpose is to make money, then they will try to make as much as possible, because that fulfills their purpose. 

2. *Assuming 1 is true, then the only things that keep capitalist businesses ""honest"" are competition and regulation.* In an ideal capitalist system the free market would regulate ""dishonest"" companies (In this case broadly defined to include anything from overpriced items to ethical concerns). After all, you can't get away with cheating your customers if you have competition undercutting you. Occasionally though, the market will result in monopolies that hold enough power to squash out competition regardless of any market factors, which is where regulation steps in. The point of regulation is to prevent abuse by monopolies.

3. *Internet providers in a large geographical country like the US often operate as a monopoly.* This is a fact, not opinion. Between lobbying for favorable laws and the prohibitive up front cost of infrastructure, it is extremely difficult for competitors to enter the market. Once you step outside the main urban areas, you will typically get all of 1 choice for internet. Even in urban areas, you will often have buildings that limit which ISPs can enter the building (I've lived in one of these and work in another). Regardless of the method, the ISPs frequently act as monopolies and, based on 2, should be regulated as such. 

4. *The internet is vital in the modern world and should be treated as a utility.* This is the first point that is opinion based, though I'd challenge you to change my opinion on it. Everything in the modern world revolves around the internet. Emails are the primary method of business communication. Streaming services are driving movie theaters out of business. Games are played online. Social media pretty much dominates everything on the planet. This reliance on internet has reached the same level of societal penetration as electricity, gas, and water, in that the modern world as we know it cannot function in its current capacity without the internet. 

5. *If ISPs operate a utility and can be considered a monopolistic business, they should be regulated in kind.* A monopoly that provides a vital service to society controls a vast amount of power. Without regulation, what's going to stop that company from abusing said power? We've already established that their purpose is to make money, and they can make more money by exerting their power as a monopoly that controls a vital service. This is where NN stepped in. 

Now, it's fair to debate exactly what items within NN are needed. Maybe some items could be removed. Maybe some items could be added. NN was the first blanket attempt to regulate the industry so it is absolutely a fair statement that it could be improved.

A ten-minute shootout ensued between the shooter—James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, a left-wing activist—and officers from the Capitol and Alexandria Police. Officers shot Hodgkinson, who died from his wounds later that day at the George Washington University Hospital.

Evidence of absence is evidence of any kind that suggests something is missing or that it does not exist.

Per the traditional aphorism, ""absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"", positive evidence of this kind is distinct from a lack of evidence or ignorance of that which should have been found already, had it existed. In this regard Irving Copi writes:



In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.

Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.

Libertarian socialism also rejects the state itself, is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization. It asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.

Which is it? Even if I assume that this is a typo and that you meant to say that regulation is worse than no regulation, I can most assuredly tell you that utility regulation is saving you an awful lot of money and possibly giving you access when you otherwise wouldn't have any. My job is to work with utilities. I've sat in on their board meetings, worked with their engineers, and designed their systems. The bureaucracy is definitely inefficient, but without it they would be charging an arm and a leg for everything and a lot of areas would have trouble gaining access to utilities at all.
