It hasn't even been five months since the worldwide PIPA & SOPA protests and Congress is back to playing its standard game of slashing and burning what we hold most important for the sake of their personal agendas. The bills of PIPA & SOPA are effectively dead, but their text is being broken up into pieces and has been put into other bills and what they represent lives on. I do not want to alarm you, the person reading thing, but you should starring long and hard at what is going on right now. We are on the precipice of something horrible happening and if we do not fight again, we will lose horribly and our personal freedoms will be maimed and impacted far beyond what we can see as the initial impact:

As of today this is where we stand:

1. SOPA (The Stop Online Piracy Act) is effectively dead

2. PIPA (The PROTECT IP Act) is effectively dead

Currently there are four bills in Congress that stand to wipe away the privacy, the anonymity, and the freedom we take advantage of every day. If any one of these bills makes it through Congress the internet as we know it is effectively over. This is a zero sum situation and we have to act again.

As it stands now, days after the House of Representatives passed CISPA, we are poised with the questions of: Who, what, where, and why? While many of the answers to those questions can be found in the links posted above the biggest reason as to why major companies like Google, Facebook, and even reddit have not spoken out vehemently against these bills is simple. They actually stand to benefit from them in some ways. CISPA was crafted from the ground up, with the help of some of these very major tech companies and the NSA, so the debacle of SOPA & PIPA wouldn't happen again. Instead of having to fight against companies and their users they now just have to worry about your average joe getting upset. Doing this paints a much smaller target on the bill and makes it that much more challenging for us to prevent the abuses that are poised to come from CISPA and the additional 'cybersecurity' bills. 

Many are calling for blackouts again but unfortunately Congress is trying a new and incredibly effective strategy this time. They are dividing us from the companies that assisted us last time. In the language of CISPA it has been found, cut and dry, that most companies will be given immunity from what goes on within their enterprises so long as they hand over your information en mass. This means that your user profile, your personal information, your comment history, the websites you link to, and even possibly what you like of Facebook and similar websites will be handed over to the government. To make matters even worse, the government will essentially bribe these companies by paying them to hand over the data. Congress did something cunningly smart, they made it so the only allies the common user has are themselves. Reddit INC as a company has no good reason to speak up loudly in support like they did with PIPA & SOPA. The reason is that they actually come to benefit from CISPA.

/r/ExplainItLikeImFive puts it nicely:

>[Basically it allows companies to provide the federal government with data concerning ""cybersecurity threats"" without liability. Currently most large websites have a Privacy Policy which normally states that companies will not voluntarily share your data. If they did share your data, then you could likely successfully sue them. CISPA protects companies from lawsuits if they share data concerning ""cybersecurity threats"" with the federal government. So companies like Facebook and Google tend to like the bill because it shields them from liability.](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sujsu/what_is_cispa/)

We must not, we cannot, allow these companies to ever believe that that selling out the user and throwing them under the bus can be part of their business model. It must be a concrete, inseparable, fact that our interests are the companies interest. You and I stood up and fought in the ways that we could to protect these companies like Google, Facebook, even Reddit INC from PIPA & SOPA. They need to do their damnedest to do the same for us. The ridiculously overused saying by pastor Martin Niemöller best fits here:

>First they came for the communists,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.

>Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.

>Then they came for the Jews,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.

>Then they came for me
and there was no one left to speak out for me.

A. They keep coming with the same attacks, just written differently every time, we must do the same. The blackout brings a gigantic black open enrollment form for all of the internet who has no idea regarding CISPA or related bills (very effective). Although I will agree they lose their effectiveness over time, this method is still and has been in the past an amazing attribute that we have created within.

B. We need to gather as a community outside of these wires and circuits. We need to hit the streets, Remember that retarded KONY 2012 Thing? DO you realize how effective that was?! We need to revamp the idea and start a creation of our own, vimeo videos, a day to repeal, meetings and hit the fucking streets. 

C. News, Who are reddits allies? Websites, Talk Show Hosts? The Huff Post or Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert, NO matter what it is, we need to either have the admins contact them and work something out or we need to continue to multiply emails to these people and have them work with us, This costs us nothing but our time, the time we are choosing how to live it. Lets not stop.

D. Can we form Donations? Billboards, commercials, whatever we have to do to gain exposure.

E.[/r/fia](/r/fia) Free Internet Activism - Everyone should at the minimum glance this page.

F. Admins/Someone Important/Potato_in_my_anus Please create an askreddit topic to figure out where and how we should start first and make this hit the front page, If I were to create it I feel as if It would not get proper exposure, we are the most powerful internet group out their, let us know how we can agree to come together.

The community as a whole is framing this argument wrong. CISPA is simultaneously undermining your right to control information about yourself while increasing corporations and governments ability to control information about their operations.

The concepts of intellectual property and privacy are entangled and by being re-active instead of pro-active, we're sacrificing liberty so that corporations thrive.

The primary purpose behind the design and implementation of the internet was to increase the efficiency of scientific research and development. It is built around the value of collaboration; allowing individuals access to facts and theories so that they can advance the rate of human creativity.

We should be writing legislation demanding more transparency of the corporations who are utilizing a government project to increase their profits instead of focusing on hitting back when they try to undermine our liberties.

Human beings have a right to privacy. Corporations have no such right. Intellectual property rights choke off creativity and productivity for the sake of constricting the number of people who profit from an idea. Yes, creators deserve to be rewarded fro the production of ""content""... but hiding the scientific principles surrounding a new technology or burying studies that call into question the value of a product are both slowing the rate of human advancement.

I'm not saying to stop defending the right to control your personal information, but we need to create a threat to the power-base of the people attacking us, or its just going to keep happening over and over.

Then I remembered an argument made by a fellow countrymen regarding e-tolling in my province*. If it works there (the USA) it will start to appear closer to home, wherever you live. Bad ideas should be stopped before they are spread by bad people.

*In South Africa's most economic active province, Gauteng, the government decided to upgrade the intercity, and urban highways (the province is about 100km x 100km in size) This is a good thing, but later on with terrible communication to the public they decided to errect drive through toll gantries. To the public the documents and information were either censored or jumbled. But the information it did give was that the average worker will pay a lot more to get to work. The cost of of living would also increase significantly, harming the poor. The tolling system would be extremely innefecient, at about 50% admin cost, but it also came to light that a lot of backers and investors in the system will coin it big time. So a cheaper alternitive to cover the cost of infrastructure upgrade would be to increase the fuel levy. People in other provinces and cities said this is unfair since they would have to pay. The argument against this was two-fold. First if the system is succesfull it would start popping up in other urban centres within a couple of years.

The government then does their bidding, which generally has negative impacts on both the people and the planet (not just the American people, mind you). The government uses the police and the armed forces to enforce the rules they put in place at the demand of the corporations. And the bulk of the money used to pay for the whole show comes from taxes. 

Taxes are paid by the public, to the government, who spend that money to bully the public into submission. 

Privatised prisons, corrupt police departments, illegal wars, forcing religion into schools, allowing companies to go unpunished for environmental destruction and endangering the world's food supplies... the list goes on. 

Spying on the public is just another step towards controlling the population they feed off.

Unfortunately, there is no quick and simple answer to this problem. There is no overnight fix. But President Obama is the closest thing you have to a leader you can trust. Show him that you respect him for the things he has done, are disappointed and feeling let-down for the things he has done wrong (in your opinion), and that you still have hope for the future. 

I think the best way to do this is through an online guide or similar that outlines all the bills and policies in a TLDR format, with the reasons and repercussions for each. 

Market the hell out of it not just in social media on the web, but in a leaflet drop where everyone able to prints out a dozen fliers a day, begging people to go and get a rough idea of what parties or candidates they can trust, and which ones are shady as fuck, (or outright crooks).

Then give them a poll to vote on how they feel about each party or candidate. Don't tell them the poll results until the end, so they can see (based on their choices) which party or candidates left them feeling the most confident and which ones feel like slimy crooks. 

It has to be fair. You can't just say ""Reddit feels this way so this is the right way""- it has to be the voice of the people. ALL the people, or as many as you can reach. 

On the same site, you could list the candidates for each position with a snopes style (crossed with wikipedia style) breakdown of the broken promises, lies told by or about each one, colour coded, with a graph or pie chart showing each group or party's history in regards to racking up debt, starting wars, telling lies to the public, breaking laws, corruption, etc etc etc... 

Make it simple enough that a casual browser can skim it and get a rough idea of which member or party is the most dirty, the best for the economy, the most reliable, the most war-hungry, has the most ties to corporations, and uses the most underhanded tactics.

In the case of CISPA, the major social sites (Facebook, Google, etc) ALREADY collect the data that is asked for in CISPA and ALREADY share, sell and store that data.  Social media sites make the bulk of their money selling user data to anyone who is willing to pay for it.  If these companies were to come out against CISPA, their very business model could asked to be aired in public, and that is the last thing they want.  Did anyone see the expose about the data Facebook is willing to handover on the flimsiest of contexts?  It's chilling to say the least.

Remember, these are companies that hold not only your name, but address, emails, credit card information, buying patterns, what websites you visit, what you read, what you click and countless other data points.  This is information that even those sites who gather it will not share with you, but will release to advertisers.  The giant revenue of companies such as Facebook and Google is based on trading and selling your personal information.

Now, ask yourself, do you think these companies would block a law which makes the sharing of this information easier?

As for Reddit, SOPA threatened their very existence.  Reddit is a site a where people could share pics and info from other sites, therefore could have fallen afoul of the restrictions in SOPA, and could have possibly forced Reddit to shutdown.  But now, with CISPA, which doesn't target companies and websites, but individuals, Reddit has no stake to lose.  That is why there is no big announcement that Reddits execs will go on the warpath.  CISPA does not affect their business plan like SOPA did, so why risk there necks by making themselves a target?

What it comes down to is that web ""giants"" will fight anything that directly affects their business model, revenue stream and very existence tooth and nail.  But when it comes to something that would solely affect their users, they could care less as long as they can exploit it to make some more money.  Take a look at the penalties or fines that major tech companies have paid for privacy transgessions and compare that to the profits they made.  Do you really think that these companies will fight to protect the very same people that they are exploiting as long as it doesn't affect their bottom line?

That's why the powers be at Reddit have been so quiet.  They have nothing to gain and nothing to lose vis a vis CISPA.  So why should they put their corporate neck on the line for something which does not affect their bottom line and something that will not harm their business model should the act pass?  Because it does not affect them, therefore they don't care.  No business will pick a fight if they are not threatened, and Reddit is no different.

Which is a shame.  If Reddit lead as zealously in this fight as they did against SOPA, it could make a difference.  Instead they opted for a tepid statement and a half hearted call to action.",False,False,False,29774,207608,1334599740.0,False,False

SOPA and PIPA were a danger to personal internet freedom AND the integrity of companies like Microsoft, Google, and reddit.  Reddit's participation in the blackout was laudable, and whatever effect it had on the movement ultimately yielded a result that was good for both the website and its users.  However, we should not pretend that the reddit admins stepped in just because the users wanted them to -- they stepped in because the issue threatened the very existence of the site itself.  See, for example, the removal of subs like jailbait.

With CISPA, reddit the company has not become a major player in the opposition because it no longer has an equal interest in the outcome.  I am actually fine with that; reddit is a huge website run by a small number of people, and it takes a lot of effort to engineer something like the last blackout.  Moreover, the number of people who actively contribute to reddit is much smaller than the number who come here simply to consume its content, and not all users are affected by American political developments.  I do not expect the role of the admins to include using the site as a soapbox for popular opinion of the users, even if the issue is something quite righteous and worth fighting for.  The users themselves do that, through the submission and discussion of content.  If the admins choose to take up an issue and run with it, then good for them -- but I do not expect them to do so unless it affects the existence of the site, even if it's an issue that many redditors feel strongly about.

**TLDR:**  It is reasonable to expect reddit to expend resources fighting for something that affects its existence.  It is not reasonable to demand reddit do the same for something that affects some of its users.

**1. Don't write to your congresscritter**

Put down that pen! Close that word processing program!
Forget all that happy crap you learned in civics class about
sharing your views with your ""representative."" You don't
have a representative any more. You merely have someone
who thinks he or she is your ""leader,"" unfettered by either
your opinions or the Constitution.
Your congresscritter assumes the role of the overseer in the
field. You are merely the ""n-word"" toiling under super-vision.
The benevolent massa wants sincerely to ""help"" you, as long
as you toil and obey.
Marx was wrong: religion isn't the opiate of the masses; in
modern America, the drug that keeps us numb, dumb and
well-behaved is a belief that we can still make a difference by
politely voicing our views to our would-be rulers and owners.
The fact is, every minute you spend writing to your congressperson
is a minute you don't spend on useful freedom
activity. Every minute you spend writing to your congressperson
is a minute you fool yourself into believing you're
accomplishing something when you're not.
101 Things To Do 'Til The Revolution
2
What happens to your letter
Here's what happens when you write your congresscritter.
Your letter is carried into his or her office in a big plastic
crate along with thousands of other letters. An aide scans it to
see what it's about and sticks a form letter in the mail to you.
Then the aide enters your name in the computer, with a
notation that you wrote to say, ""Vote yes on X"" or ""Vote no
on Y.""
If you're lucky, they might actually get the topic right. If
you're really lucky, they'll record you as being on the side of
the issue you're actually on. They're just as likely to record
you as being one of your own political enemies, though.
Doesn't that make you feel special?
Even if you get what appears to be a ""customized"" reply, it
was written by an aide and probably signed by a machine. The
congressperson never saw either your letter or his or her own
reply.
If you send an e-mail, an automated system scans your
message and zaps back a reply, without your message having
been seen by human eyes.
The whole process is designed to say, 'There, there now,
little citizen, your congressperson cares"" — when, in fact,
nobody cares.
If you're rich, famous, powerful or influential (or if they
think you're a dangerous loony, but that's not an impression
you want to make), you have a chance of being heard by
someone in Congress. Otherwise, the only time you have the
slightest chance of influencing a congressperson's views is
when your letter — or fax or phone call — is one of several
thousand expressing the same opinion. Then it's only going to
help if: 1) the congressperson is already on your side of the
issue and wants to wave a basketful of supporting letters
during a floor debate; or, 2) the congressperson's seat is
Chapter One and Only
3
insecure and he or she has to do what the people want for a
change, or else.
The only method that might do a bit of good
If you just can't live without writing to your congressperson,
keep a stack of pre-addressed postcards handy, and
when you're so roused up about something you simply have
to do it, write, ""Vote no on HJ32000, the Counterterrorism
Act sponsored by Rep. Bigbro,"" or ""Vote yes on SB504, the
Privacy Amendment sponsored by Sen. Rarebird.""
Bright-colored postcards get more notice, just as shiny
objects best attract the attention of mindless rats.
Keep it that simple. Don't waste your time on reasoned
argument or constitutional issues. Use those arguments
elsewhere, with people who might actually listen.
In order to become the master, the politician poses as
the servant.

They don't consider our situation to be 'their fight' even when it really should be. They figure that we're their users regardless and don't care. If there is consequence for them then they will be more inclined to say something.*

Facebook, reddit, Google, you need to get back in the ring. We stood with you and I don't mean to sound pushy but its your moral obligation to stand with us. If you are not willing to fight on our behalf then we will be left with only two options. We can either sit here and let you sell us out because its convenient or we can demonize you for the actions you choose to support and revile you until we are capable of creating something that will leave you obsolete. You may believe that you are too big and too influential for some random person talking on the internet to do much harm to your enterprises, but make no mistake that if you do not make it your imperative to fight for us in the open and behind the scenes then we will be left with the only option of creating, through necessity, something that takes you out of the equation. 

Out of all of these bills I have yet to see the focus of attention be on the biggest problems we face. Those problems boil down to government employees, contractors, and users with access to sensitive networks misbehaving and not doing what they should. No government employee should be downloading torrents, watching porn, blogging, or any of the sort on government computers. This leaves them vulnerable. Outdated software, and insecure networks, when coupled with connecting infected cell phones or USB sticks to these systems compromises them to such a level that nearly every company or aspect of government has been compromised on some level. Here are just few articles out of hundreds that highlight the plague of incompetence that could so easily be stopped by proper training and setting essential standards within government agencies, private contractors, and the US military. Almost all of these things do not require new laws but instead require internal changes that effect management and policy within these entities.

**Changes in Current Cybersecurity Law are Needed:**

The fact of the matter is that current cybersecurity laws are lacking. While a vast majority of problems could be prevented by reasonable, common sense, approaches and policies within agencies, it still stands that the current law is lacking in certain regards. However, the blanket approaches that are used in all of these bills and that are all too common cannot be used as they are so far reaching and apply to nearly every aspect of the internet. SOPA & PIPA drew so much ire due to the easily broad interpretations that could be made under their legislation. Similarly, CISPA and the additional bills, follow this line of thinking. Rather than just throwing everything under the sun under a single umbrella Congress needs to be much more choosy about where they allow for broad interpretations within their legislation. Loopholes and blanket approaches cannot stand and we need to make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. Using ""protecting children"" as part of the actual language of the bill to include topics covered by CISPA is outrageous. 


**I hope many of you are asking how you can help:**

 If you want spend a few minutes you can retweet, discuss and link to articles on facebook, talk to your friends and family, upvote these kinds of topics on reddit. Subscribe to /r/evolutionreddit, /r/fia, or any of the various subreddits that these subreddits link to. If you want to be informed, then doing the little things will make all the difference. The little things add up and your effort could be the piece of straw that breaks the camel's back.

If you are a doodler you can create a work that symbolizes what is wrong with these bills and please release it under one of the appropriate licenses. If you are a video editor, or even have a webcam, you can make a work and upload it to youtube or any of the various other video websites so others can watch and become better informed. If you you are a writer or a journalist, and it doesn't matter what your level of expertise is, you can help explain to others why these bills are to atrocious. If you are on a school paper you can write an article and bring the fight to your campus. 

If you have an email, if you have a phone, if you have five minutes to kill, you can call or write someone and give them a piece of your mind. 

All that matters is that you try to do your part. Give up an afternoon and print out fliers to pass out around town, to stick under windshields, to staple to a local bulletin board. If we do not advocate for ourselves them nobody else will.

reddit INC we need your help. During PIPA & SOPA you blacked out your website. I fully understand that it must have cost you quite a pretty penny and there is a chance that your corporate owners may not allow you to do the same again. However, sitting here and just speaking a blurb does not cut it. You have the resources to reach out to the community and explain to the uninformed just how sweeping and damaging CISPA will be on your users. You have the means at your disposal to dissect CISPA and make it accessible to every John, Mary, and Sue. You are capable of motivating hundreds of thousands of people to speak up and create a ripple so large that the rest of the internet will be forced to take notice. We are not asking you shut down every time some there is a jarring bill that wishes to take away what we hold dear, we are asking you to stand with us on the front lines and to keep standing there with us so we do not have to fight alone. Give us a blog post that rivals ['A Technicaly Examination of SOPA & PROTECT IP](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html).

If the “only way we win is when we stop electing people who step on our rights” then lets vote those people out of office.  All it takes for something like this to start is by having an idea, ‘Vote to be represented, Not punished’. (I’m not that good at catchy phrases so it is open to refinement, but you get the idea.)  Spread this idea around like so many other things are and everyone will realize that the current congressmen are doing more harm than good, and we can elect the proper candidates to be in those offices.  Seriously, if people who read this could find ways to tell people to not vote for the current congressmen in office then this idea will start to take effect.  
I was also questioning myself about the effectiveness of the petition the other day too.  I’ve been amazed this year with the success have gotten.  So much so that it raised a question for me to ask; could it be possible to have laws revoked by petition?  Honestly, if there was a petition that was spread around to remove the NDAA Act, which allows for the detainment of Americans indefinitely without trial, I would sign it along with everyone else I know.  Does anyone know if it is possible to get something like this to going?

It probably has something to do with how biased the community is, and how very few facts and constructive discussions have taken place.

Take, for example, [this hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3896492) thread about CISPA passing the House. You will see that the top comment is not pandering to a preconceived opinion, but rather playing devil's advocate (at the very least).

On reddit, any thread about CISPA only has comments against CISPA -- many of them vague and not supported by any facts or legal analysis. Anything challenging the hivemind is ruthlessly downvoted, and no constructive discussion takes place.

It was slightly less worse with SOPA because we had people like Kirby Ferguson explaining the problems and more importantly, being honest with you guys. You are now not being honest with yourselves and you are letting blind hatred guide your decision making. This is incredibly irresponsible.

I laughed reading a thread in /r/bestof where practically everyone is BLAMING Reddit, Inc. for not taking huge strides this time, when there's barely any solid opinion about the bill from the community. Most of the activity is centralized in /r/technology and /r/politics.

I see this going two ways: either a more honest opinion will unfold where the reddit community can actually constructively form opposition to privacy-attacking legislation, or this cesspool will stir out of control and blame the administrators for not doing enough to coerce the community into a position on the issue.

It is also important to note that websites like Reddit and Wikipedia are in a position where they must be responsible and not try to shape public opinion or be biased. The only reason they agreed to blackouts was because SOPA passing would actually damage those websites severely. Without that interest, they have a responsibility to be neutral on most issues.

it allows for shutting down accounts and sites if there is believed to be a threat not just to the infrastructure of the internet or national security, but to the financial interests of big media companies. as far as CISPA is concerned, intellectual property theft–otherwise known as piracy–represents a threat to cybersecurity. with that in mind, the sharing of personal information is not the issue.

I've read the bill. It's not SOPA II at all. It's very much targeting an actual problem: in the event of a widespread cyber-security threat (like a massive DOS attack on multiple websites), corporations are not currently able to share threat information in the ways that they need to. That's a legitimate issue.

The real problem with the bill is that the over-broad language might potentially allow it to be abused. But even that's less of an issue than you might think.

> if you trust your Internet provider, e-mail provider, and so on, to protect your privacy, CISPA should not be a worrisome bill. The U.S. government can't force companies to open their databases and networks; federal agencies can only request it. - [CNET](http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57422693-281/how-cispa-would-affect-you-faq/)

Think critically about this for a moment. If you know that the companies you contract with are reliable, CISPA is not a bill you should be worried about. To an extent this is good news; many businesses like Google have a strong history of [trying to protect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_International_Inc._v._YouTube,_Inc.#District_Court_proceedings) user privacy.

If, on the other hand, you don't trust someone, e.g. Facebook, with your data, let's think about what that entails.

First of all, if you are giving information you wish to protect to a company  you don't trust, ""you're gonna have a bad time."" Who on earth would give sensitive data to Facebook? The only thing this bill changes is that they can now share it, under certain prescribed circumstances, to certain prescribed entities to be used for cyber-security purposes. You *really* thought your data was private before? At least now you know otherwise.

If you have something worth actually protecting, you should have it encrypted, with a key only you have. Anything less is illusory security, which is worth nothing at all.

Are there real issues with CISPA? Yes, of course.

Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity.  I appreciate hearing from you.
 
We must be vigilant in protecting the privacy rights of Americans.  As a United States Senator, my primary responsibilities are to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people.  
 
At the present time, we know our public and private networks are alarmingly vulnerable to intrusion.  This is undermining both our national security and our economic competiveness.  We need to do more to secure out networks, and there isn’t any reason this should be a partisan or ideological issue.  
 
We should work together to pass cybersecurity legislation that safeguards our critical infrastructure, permits more timely sharing of information with stakeholders, and recruits the next generation of talented cyber personnel.  Any approach on cybersecurity must also include meaningful provisions that prevent the sharing of sensitive personal information with other government agencies or private sector entities.  The end goal of cybersecurity should be to make the personal data of online users more secure.
 
As you may know, there are a number of different legislative proposals on cybersecurity currently before Congress.  I am evaluating all of the different bills, and I will keep your thoughts in mind as opportunities to address cybersecurity come before the full Senate.
 
I value the input of fellow Coloradans in considering the wide variety of important issues and legislative initiatives that come before the Senate.  I hope you will continue to inform me of your thoughts and concerns.
 
For more information about my priorities as a U.S. Senator, I invite you to visit my website at http://bennet.senate.gov/.  Again, thank you for contacting me.

Second: you're drinking too much Ron Paul Kool-aid. He's just another republican politician who hides his anti-science views (such as global warming being a scam lol). He hides behind having to take any real position on any real topic by claiming to want to let individual states take care of it. He also wants to go back to the gold standard. There isn't enough gold in the world to go to a gold standard. 

But I have very little faith in American politics. Especially considering the track record. 

Interesting thing to wonder about: how does Ron Paul plan to override a corrosive congress and a sold-out senate in order to get his magical plans to go forward?

Simple. He can't and he knows it. Everyone with a pair of braincells who hasn't gulped from his Jesus-juice Understands it. He's using both parties to get what he wants: to just be called president and continue the same cycle the Bush family began. RP isn't dumb, and he's got a great marketing campaign going for him. He just requires the stupid and the stoned. By joining the republicans, he got the stupid. By avoiding to take a position on weed, he got the stoners vote. 

American politics are (and for Most of the last 20 years, have been) a huge joke. There is a joke from a comedian that is often quoted. I'll paraphrase badly: ""I like the puppet on the left, but the puppet on the right aligns with my views. Oh wait, they are both controlled by the same guy!""

I highly doubt he was unaware of what was going on at the time. Unless his wife was dying in hospital, it just seems too coincidental to me.

2. Absolutely not. The drug war is archaic and counter-productive. But the drug war preceded Obama and it will outlast him. Entire agencies exist to fight the war on drugs. It's definitely not something Obama can actually remove without congressional support. But I also don't think that Obama would end the war on drugs even if he DID have congressional support.

Well doing something such as making a short incursion into Libya without ground troops (I believe that was the idea) was something that Obama technically wasn't allowed to do. Same thing with nabbing Osama from Pakistan.

Government spying again, precedes him and will outlast him. America is built upon a huge spy network (embassies, CIA, NSA, etc). Those agencies simply will not go away. And I hope they don't, personally, as long as they are still pointed externally. But maybe I read too many old Tom Clancy novels. 

I believe the president has power to make small decisions that normally take a very long time to be debated and approved/denied in congress. For example Libya and Pakistan. How many weeks would it have taken for congress to approve picking up Osama? What would have been the odds for him to have remained there? 

The president, outside of snap decisions, is basically our last chance for a veto vote against the incredibly stupid amount of bills attempting to be passed.

The problem is that Ron Paul knows that. His campaign is based on things that are slow decisions and require long term implementation (such as destroying the fed, gold standard, and every other idea he has). We simply don't know how he will act when it comes to the quick decisions that actually make a president.

Lastly, I still think Obama the most left of any presidential candidate, currently. He implemented medicare.....no other president in the history of America has done this. And he did it in a recession. With a republican dominated congress. If I could vote, I'd give him another term. And then Hillary twice.",False,False,False,3610,1524,1277329443.0,False,False

I used to be into really insane heavy metal (like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4ui9q7eDM), the first 20 seconds will make the point), then I got a bit more artsy and sophisticated and got into progressive stuff, like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4ui9q7eDM). While that still stays with me, it's expanded a lot since, into classic rock ([cream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkae0-TgrRU), [led zep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNhD0oS5pk&ob=av2n), [deep purple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfAWReBmxEs), you know the drill), modern art/psychedelic rock ([muse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sclt7c5DUe4), [my morning jacket](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZCQV2dcSTE), [linkin park](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bftTUAIVMUQ), [wolfmother](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O63P9Ecujc)), and psychedelic rock ([the koolaid electric company](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjhcwfE5Idc), [the doors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKbPUzhWeeI), of course, [pink floyd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeXkHfWYVo), [the blue angel lounge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY4r4C3BrV0))

You may want to reread my comments. This sentence tells me you didn't understand what I was saying. 

*You* said voting wasn't enough. And I never disagreed. I just pointed out how most people have been conditioned to think that it is. That's what distinguishes a democratic system from any other after all; protesting/campaigning in all their various other forms are just as effective under any other governmental system which allows them, so if voting doesn't matter why bother with the pretense of democracy? 

No, you're confronting most people with a reality that undermines a huge portion of what we've been taught about our country, and calling them whiney at the same time. The fact remains that staying informed about issues and voting at every opportunity are all that the average citizen needs to do to make a democratic republic that *will* function well- ""should"" doesn't enter into it. 

What you're doing here is going on to a website frequented by folks who tend to be more knowledgeable than average about any given political issue, and telling them that they have to pick up the slack for the rest of the country. And that they're lazy or apathetic for not doing so. 

Personally, I'm doing everything expected of me as a citizen by staying informed and voting. If you want to take your ""with us or against us"" attitude and apply it to my valuation of freedom because of that, go right ahead, but it won't win you many allies.

>Yes- vote with [the information]. That's the active part.

You may want to reread your comments.  Also, I've never said voting doesn't matter.  It most definitely does matter.  What I'm saying is that sometimes, simply voting - informed or otherwise - may not be enough.  Sometimes, protesting isn't enough.  Sometimes, you have to take direct action if you feel strongly enough about your cause.  Sometimes, you have to be the change you want to see in the world.  (sorry for the cliche)  If the problem is corrupt politicians, then be one that isn't.  Or find one that isn't, and get them elected.  Raise awareness, work on a campaign, lead a campaign, be in an election.  Whatever level you choose to help at, just help. There is more you can do - more you have a responsibility to do - if you believe the government is out of control.  

I honestly don't care what most people have been taught. Just because they have been taught wrong information doesn't make it not wrong.  And if the truth about our system (that it calls upon every citizen to be personally responsible for their government) undermines what they've been taught, then maybe what they've been taught needs undermining.  And if being informed and voting at every opportunity is all it takes to keep government from becoming corrupt and ignoring the will of the people, then the problem is still our (the population as a whole) fault because the vast majority of people *do not do this.*

I understand most people here are better informed than John Q. Public.  And I'm sorry if other people dropping the ball means you and I have to pick it up.  That sucks.  But if not you, then who?  Sure, you ""should"" be able to just be an informed voter.  But since the reality of the situation is that just being an informed voter isn't enough, just sitting back and letting the ""bad guys"" take over means you have a level of apathy/cynicism/laziness/whatever-the-hell-it-is towards the process that prevents you from giving enough of a shit to work harder, do more.  

It's not a ""with us or against us"" attitude.  It's a ""you don't like it? then do something about it!"" attitude.  I'm not even discussing a position anymore.  It's not about taking any *particular* position.  It's about taking *a position*, and following through.  If all you want to do is be an informed voter, then fine, do that.  Just don't be surprised when it isn't enough.  (Sometimes it is.)

It's actually perfectly appropriate, since that's exactly what I (for instance) am doing- keeping informed of relevant issues, voting accordingly, and generally conducting myself in a benevolent manner. This is the change I want to see in the world. I don't want to see people driven by a passion for a very abstract concept like freedom, even if it means they do good occasionally- those people tend to be easy to manipulate.

Well, you seem motivated. Part of my point is that *your* effort, personally, would be much more productively allocated by going out and informing people/campaigning etc. than chastizing those of us who'd rather not.

Alternatively, if enough people come to actually *believe* the quoted sentiment instead of dismissing it as originating in apathy, it's entirely possible that the idea of increasing the power of the vote relative to other forms of political influence could come to receive much more attention and support. The cry of ""nothing will ever change"" has been enough to spark change before.

Point being, if you want to motivate people to actually do something in a situation like this, general advice like ""get involved in local politics"" and ""stop being apathetic"" isn't the best approach.

Advice: apply a machine learning classifier to separate herp-derp from actual substantial posts. Then give us the curated feed. You could call this feature ""-herpderp"" and would work by adding ""-herpderp"" to the URL of any subreddit. Ideally, it would curate the comments too, not just the subreddit feed.

I could do it myself but I don't want to implement a feature off-site.

This web site has had revenue generation problems from day one and they still haven't figured it out.

Your point was that, rather than unsubscribing from /r/all, you should browse it and bitch about it: 

> Doesn't help when browsing /r/all.

Simple solution: don't browse /r/all. There's one foolproof way to avoid content you don't want to see: *don't browse the part of the website where that content is.*

> It shows what reddit is into at a greater scale than my own personal interests.

If you're willingly venturing on to /r/all, then don't bitch when you see /r/atheism comments. 

>Bitching about what people are bitching about does about as much good as bitching about how other people want to use a website. So how is this not a case of the pot calling the kettle black?

I unsubscribe from subreddits I don't want to view *so I don't have to bitch/circlejerk about how bad they are.* I'm not bitching, I'm explaining to you in not-so-nice terms *how to easily avoid content that you don't want to see.* It's easy when you're not an idiot about it.

That wasn't my point. My point was *if* you chose to browse /r/all, then it wouldn't help. Which is what I posted.

> Simple solution: don't browse /r/all. There's one foolproof way to avoid content you don't want to see: don't browse the part of the website where that content is.

But what if I want to browse /r/all? And since when am I one of the people bitching about the content? I just pointed out that the earlier solution doesn't work when browsing /r/all. That's it; nothing more, nothing less.

> If you're willingly venturing on to /r/all, then don't bitch when you see /r/atheism comments. 

I don't.

> I unsubscribe from subreddits I don't want to view so I don't have to bitch/circlejerk about how bad they are. I'm not bitching, I'm explaining to you in not-so-nice terms how to easily avoid content that you don't want to see. It's easy when you're not an idiot about it. 

Except you are preaching to the choir; I already know not to bitch about these kinds of things. Explaining in not-so-nice terms can be considered a form of bitching. (Or, more actually, it is *being* bitchy.)

> It's like saying
 
>> Oh man, I hate Domino's Pizza, but I'm going to keep ordering it to my house because it shows what pizza people are into at a greater scale than my own personal interests.

A more appropriate analogy would be:

* I don't like how all meat pizzas are so greasy.
* Then order veggie.

Sure, it is a solution. But it doesn't help when what you want is a meat pizza.

> Fuck other people's interests. Order whatever pizza you want. 

Fuck other people's reading habits; read whatever you want.

Fuck other people's complaints; bitch about whatever you want.

Or, in other words, I think we actually agree on the core principles here. As I said, I was just trying to point out that unsubbing does not help the content displayed on /r/all -- which is obviously obvious.

EDIT: Story time kids. Once upon a time as the legend goes there was a guy named Redditnoir who was a novelty account *juuust* like Shitty but not quite. You see, Noir went around replying to comments with a part of a story... would've been a great story had he completed it... Noir always wrote as though he was a detective looking for someone in the dirty cold city named Reddit some say it was /u/karmanut, other say it was /u/potato_in_my_anus, other thought he was just chasing his tail. Noir ventured through the red light districts full of those pretty /r/gonewild girls with the neck beards staring greedily and throwing upvotes hoping for more. Unfortunately, Noir mashed too many toes... pushed is nose in too many dark corners... on his search... and Shitty was sent after him to silence him **at all cost.**

It wasn't till that faithful day, while following his clues, [Shitty found him](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s62r2/every_single_time_i_open_my_oven_i_dont_wait_long/c4beubx?context=4) and blindsided him with more paintings than he could write stories to. The dark side of the hive mind seeing defeat started mailing threats to Noir, who knew things would never die down... did the bravest thing a man could ever do. He loaded his gun, pointed the barrel to the underside of his chin... and pulled the trigger. Me myself? I don't think he did it, I think he was man enough to click that deactivate button and is now free, free to explore that mysterious place that's mentioned in /r/outside.

The overlords of Reddit more specifically that slime bag,  mainly /u/yishan, they rewarded /u/Shitty_Watercolour handsomely with votes, karma and reddit gold. Last I heard, he has lifetime access to that fancy place named /r/lounge. [obligartory link](http://www.reddit.com/r/yishansucks)

So that, /u/koenm, /u/AukeXI, /u/EARink0, /u/elborracho420, /u/noteberry, /u/zaccos and /u/frere_de_la_cote, that is the reason why ever time I see /u/Shitty_Watercolour **I downvote that bastard, but he never notices with all the protection he gets anyway.**",False,False,1369180999.0,19689,3166,1311715008.0,False,False
