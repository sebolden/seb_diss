You're missing the most important step here: incorporating the suggested feedback and having leadership that has sufficient resolve and tenacity to change track when they see something isn't working as one'd hoped.


----

I'd love a list of the 10 biggest changes in policy and vision you've made as a result of user-feedback since the alpha of the redesign.

Where were you most wrong and what did you learn from being wrong on those issues? How is that helping the team get the redesign even more right prior to launch?",False,False,False,201929,21008,1345491898.0,False,True

[This is what we have setup currently](https://i.imgur.com/xOdFQBy.jpg) over at /r/NieR

* We have a basic animated banner.
* Posts are stylised, and have a number count against them.
* Thumbnails change depending on the post type (NSFW, Spoliers, Discussions, Announcements).
* Submission buttons overlapping the sidebar image.
* Custom userflairs with popup text upon mouseover.

None of this is at all achievable with your redesign, and furthermore what you can change is heavily restricted:

* Banner image heights are limited to 3 sizes, with very little control over their placement.
* All colours are purely static, no gradient support at all.
* The new userflairs are a huge step backwards in what you can do with them.

The whole thing quite frankly sucks in its current implementation, the only redeeming feature from this entire thing is the new configurable post requirements section.

**Breaking down a standard submission:**

[Here's an image](https://i.imgur.com/c53kfWT.png)

-1. As mentioned above, our thumbnails are different depending on post type, you can currently only assign one ""default"" thumbnail in the redesign, there's no ability to configure these for spoilers/nsfw etc. There's no ability to set the size of the thumbnails either, they're something like 40x60, so no nice uniform square thumbnails.

-2. There doesn't seem to be a way to align submission flairs to the left hand side, with the redesign they're always on the right, not to mention you cannot style them.


-3. This is the overall background image of the post, you can currently change this in the redesign but then it'd clash with item 4 which is a second background decor image placed in the corner, the redesign only allows you to set one BG image, and very little control is given as to how you'd like to use it.


-5. Much like post flairs, there's really no customisability in the redesign for userflairs. 


-6. No ability to even show post rankings, let alone style them.

There's a load of other things i'd like to go into such as the inability to use a different font, change text colour, and so on but there's really no point.

If not, you run the risk of third-party analytics (people posting images which track who's looked at a post). Imagine if Facebook and imgur struck a deal. Any image hosted on imgur and hotlinked into a comment. Imgur puts a cookie on your computer. Facebook now knows you hang out at /r/ClopClop...

If so, be mindful on a couple of things (which you're probably already aware of):

Most (if not all) bitmap formats (jpg, png, etc) put the header at the beginning of the file. The file is read until the end of the data, not the end of the file. RAR archives put the header at the END of the file. If you take a JPG and use:

    copy /b 1.jpg + 2.rar combinedfile.jpg

You'll end up with an file which displays a picture in the browser and can also be opened with 7zip. I'd suggest implementing both a size limitation and a file truncator (your server looks at the image's header and discards everything after the end of the image data.

Current Reddit is unpredictable in terms of Title-Click behavior, and while an experienced Redditor knows what post type does what, through our user research sessions over the past year, we found that for any new user, this is an non-optimal experience. We opted to consolidate all title clicks to lead to one location. In most of our post types, it leads to conversation. Over time and a lot of feedback from the redesign community, we made link click behavior more prominent in terms of indication of clickable thumbnail and outbound source after the title.

Overall, we think this approach best sets our users up for success in terms of not having to think about what goes where, and understand that the change in functionality can be frustrating.

If you're doing a redesign, you're better off thinking of ways to improve your site's core functionalities instead of adding a new one (chat) that runs contrary to your modus operandi instead of taking your core stuff forward.

I'll be the first to criticize reddit's main design for not allowing group conversations but instead just comment threads where people reply to one another on a one-by-one basis. You can't have a group discussion or subscribe to a comment thread.

The logic for this is that with infinite scroll, they want there to be a fast and logical way for you to return to your place in the home feed without losing your place. If you middle click / open in new tab, you get a non pop-up version of the thread, so IMO you're already able to choose how you want to view.

Well, speaking as an r/politics mod, I *do* always want the rules widget to be visible at least. As for the rest of the sidebar - they only recently started having all widgets show up and I'm not sure I care? I guess as long as there has to be space over there for rules - and ads, which I'm guessing is the main reason - might as well load the entire sidebar.

To your perspective, you are perfectly able to comment and post, but no one else is able to see it. According to the last announcement where it was discussed, admins try to only use the operation for spambot accounts.

If you post something and a moderator or automoderator bans you, you are given a message informing you that you are banned from that subreddit. After that point, you can no longer comment or submit posts in that subreddit, but you can still read and upvote/downvote.

I *think* you are referring to a trick that some subreddits do, where they modify their automoderator script to detect submissions authored by a given user and quietly deletes that activity. I've heard this referred to as an automod-ban or a stealth-ban, but there's no ""official"" term for it, because it's just a manipulation of the scripting mechanism. 

I believe you are talking about that third type. I was not aware of many subreddits bothering to use this much anymore. All you need to do to detect if this has happened to you in a sub is to post a perfectly innocuous comment, and then sign out, refresh the page, and see if your comment is visible (it sometimes takes a moment).

Whenever this third type of ban happens, it means that a moderator with permission to edit the automoderator script has taken the time to edit the script to add your username to the list. This is not an operation that can be performed by automoderator; as in, there's no (normal) way to instruct automoderator to start deleting everything you post from that moment on, just because it detected that you posted something against the rules.

Now outside of the automod script, people can write more formalized bots that can be granted moderator priviliges. Those can then use the reddit API to issue a traditional subreddit ban. At one point, people were writing scripts that would scan activity even on *other* subreddits, and ban you from a subreddit that you've never even operated  in. I'm opposed to this. And this was brought up repeatedly back when they were doing the community_dialogue effort.

But as far as polarizing political subreddits, as long as a subreddit's moderation team has the liberty to ban however they please, this is still going to be every bit as much of a problem as it currently is now. The only way to solve this is to use a *completely* different platform that involved a stronger mechanism for meta-moderation, such that moderators can be taken to task for issuing bans to users who are participating in civil discussion. Wikipedia, for example, has such a mechanism and it's explicitly defined. However, it's also *extremely* complicated.

Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. He was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons, the website framework web.py, and the social news site Reddit, in which he became a partner after its merger with his company, Infogami.

Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism.

I'm sure the entire design team knows this, but for others who aren't as deep into the subject, here's a short overview.

---

The properties of the objects need to lead users to use them correctly. A door you need to pull should have a handle that leads to you pull it. An automatically sliding door shouldn't have one. 

When we navigate the web and click on something, we expect to arrive at that something. 

That's the most basic affordance of hyperlinking and it isn't something reddit can change unless they find a better solution to the same inherent design-problem across the web.

It's less clear cut with pictures: on some sites clicking on a clickable picture leads the picture to be enlarged, on other sites it leads to the image file or something else.

---

The basic, most common affordance of hyperlinking online, whenever you scroll through some feed, or are on some landing page, clicking on the title of a submission, you expect to come to that submission.

So inherently, marking the different use case, the text-post that exists on reddit and should lead to a comment page, should clearly and obviously  be distinguished from off-site links.

That means that self-post elements should be designed differently to link-posts so we intuitively realize they're different and should expect different results by clicking on them.

Alternatively, you get rid of link posts altogether (as in the redesign where you always land on the comments). If that's the goal, reddit has changed form its outset as a content aggregate.

By claiming that it ""incited violence"", I can only assume that reddit was including suicide as ""violence against the self"", but even then, that's tenuous. It's more of a philosophical argument than anything else, can you commit violence on yourself? Or does violence imply a lack of consent?

""The vast majority of suicides are unnecessary reactions, because most people recover from suicidal depression.""

This is exactly the reason that Sanctioned Suicide existed, to provide a place to talk free of this opinion. It's unfounded, and very hurtful. Even if we assume that it's true, what about the minority that don't recover from depression? Or who aren't depressed? Or you are making a rational choice to end their lives? That was the purpose of SS. /r/depression, /r/suicidewatch, etc, are for the ""majority"" who are getting better or want to get better. There is now nowhere for the minority, the ones who won't get better, and despite what society tells us, sometimes, people don't make it. Not everyone has their happy ending.

""But that sort of thing is not the type of thing that needs to be discussed with random people who don't know you, but with your doctors and friends and family.""

So, you're saying people aren't allowed to discus personal issues on the internet? If that was true, social media as a concept wouldn't exist. People wouldn't talke about childbirth, cancer, personal finance, etc, because they are ""personal"". The anonymity of the internet provides a voice that many people, including myself, would be unable or unwilling to use without that anonymity. That voice is now gone, and while I can understand why reddit did this (To cover themselves legally, I expect) I can't agree that there was ""not much reason"" to keep that sub. There is nowhere for people like me to go now. There are a few ""spinoffs"" from SS, but I'm sure they will either die due to inactivity, or be banned as well in the coming days or weeks.

""Every single person who killed themselves after reading that sub would be Reddit's fault.""

This would be the perception, and is, no doubt, the reason for the banning, but it is untrue. Sanctioned Suicide, as it name implied, simply respected the free and personal choice of an individual to end their lives. It did not encourage or suggest it, that choice and that responsibility always lay with that individual.

That's equivalent (essentially) to saying ""If you need a place for people to talk about religion, then it needs to be based on Christian ideology"" or ""If you need a place to talk about homosexuality, then it needs to be anti-gay rights"". Why does discussion of suicide need to be life-affirming?

> The vast majority of suicides are unnecessary reactions, because most people recover from suicidal depression.

*Most* people recover from suicidal depression? Do they, really? I wouldn't be so sure about that. First, there is the fact that there is a large enough number of people who say that they are depressed, but are not actually depressed - thanks to depression having become a bit of a ""fashionable"" thing in recent times. These people will say that they are depressed over minor (and ultimately inconsequential) things and sometimes go as far as to say that it'd be nice if they were dead, so that they didn't have to deal with it. As soon as those 'problems' resolve for them, they will say that they are no longer depressed and suicidal. This gives people who have never experienced real depression the idea that depression (and thus also suicidality) is something that is easily solvable or something that a person can ultimately just snap out of. This is at the cost of the people who are *truly* depressed and suicidal, because they will be taken less seriously as a result. The faux depressed essentially give the real depressed a bad name, often unintentionally so.

In addition to this, there is also the fact that whenever the general public gets to hear people talk about their failed suicide attempt, it is always done in a pro-life manner. You always only ever hear about the people who regretted their attempts and subsequently were able to find meaning in their existence again. You never hear about the people who didn't regret their failed suicide attempt (other than the fact that it failed) and are determined to do it again. There are *plenty* of those out there, but society does not agree with their viewpoints, so they are hidden from view. In other words: the general public is only allowed to hear about one side of the coin and members of the general public are not interested enough to voluntarily want to do some digging of their own and find out more about the other side of the coin. In fact, most do not even care to educate themselves on the *very basics* of depression and suicidality by reading a book about it (preferably a scientifically-minded one instead of e.g. one that is written from a religious point of view). They will just remember the bits that society feeds them through the media every now and then, and then just mindlessly follow the narrative that society has laid out for them.

When you combine all of this and other similar things (that involve misinformation and misconceptions), it is clear to see that there is significant potential for the non-depressed to be easily misled into concluding that most people recover from suicidal depression. That is not necessarily the case at all. The reality is much more likely to be less simplistic and darker than that.

> But that sort of thing is not the type of thing that needs to be discussed with random people who don't know you, but with your doctors and friends and family.

It would indeed be wonderfully ideal if suicidal people were able to discuss such things with their friends and family, but that is not a realistic expectation to have. At all. For example, such things need to be discussed calmy, rationally and without judgement - and friends and family are often too close to the suicidal person for them to be able to do so. That is, when the suicidal person comes from a non-abusive family and even has friends. They will react emotionally (and even hysterically in some cases) and as a result, subsequently make decisions that *might* come from a place of good intentions, but are actually not thought through and misguided and will often leave the suicidal person even worse off. Such as calling the police on them or having them be forcibly hospitalised against their own will for ""their own good"". Do you *really* think that that will make suicidal people feel warmly understood and invited to share more about what they are going through? Do force and draconian measures *really* make life seem more bright again? Quite the opposite, in fact. It removes trust and the inclination to talk about it with people for good and makes the suicidal person put the little energy they have left into putting up a socially acceptable mask of fake happiness. As a result, the suicidal person's sense of being misunderstood and alone is increased. Ultimately, the suicidal person will end up feeling that they are being kept here against their will.

A doctor isn't going to be of much help in this either, by the way, because they will be afraid of possible lawsuits from grieving but irrational relatives and the like. So even if he or she personally respects your wish to die, he or she will not do anything about it in order to protect themselves (which is understandable in the current pro-life climate). At best, they might be knowingly passive in the whole process and essentially leave you to your own devices. At worst, they will diligently follow the whole ""Keep you alive at all costs!"" script (which includes forced hospitalisation) so that afterwards, not even the best attorney will be able to build a case against them for medical malpractice or something along those lines.

So, all in all, doctors and family and friends are not the go-to option as they might seem at first glance. They might be for everything else, but not for suicide. Not if you want to avoid having your freedom and privacy taken away and subsequently be violated in many ways (be they subtle or not so subtle)... if you want to avoid being made to feel less than human.

And all this while it is a suicidal person's *own* body and *own* life. Why is it that society is okay with people doing all sorts of things with their bodies because it is *their* body and *their* life (""live and let live""), but as soon as these people wish for their bodies to die and make active preparations for it, suddenly society claims it has the right to butt in and have a say about people's bodies and lives? What gives society the right? People are not owned by society, we are not slaves. Society is quite hypocritical as well, by the way. You can enlist in the army at age 18 and subsequently be shipped off to war zones (where you could *die* at any moment) as soon as your training is complete, but when an adult of 30, 55 or even 72 decides after long and careful contemplation that they want to take their own life, it has to be prevented *at all costs*?! These double standards that society has, are much sicker and unhealthier than any suicidal person that is being honest about their feelings and taking steps to do what they feel is best for them. Why can't people let other people alone? Stop infantilising people and nannying them. Let them make decisions for themselves, otherwise people are just glorified slaves in a hamster wheel. Their body, their life, their choice.

Also, sometimes the most loving thing to do, is to let someone go. I'm saying that as someone who is not only suicidal, but has also lost people (including a close relative) to suicide. But unfortunately, it seems that most people aren't capable of that kind of open-mindedness, strength and altruism. That is a right shame, but hopefully that will improve somewhat in the coming decades.

> Every single person who killed themselves after reading that sub would be Reddit's fault.

No, people are responsible for their own decisions, actions, bodies and lives. Including their interpretation of the texts that they come across on the Internet. It is unfair to put that on Reddit.

> If you need a place for suicidal people to talk, then it needs to be life affirming.

If you dearly love life and enjoy being alive, then good for you. You belong to a fortunate and privileged group of people then. However, that does *not* give you the right to dictate that any communities dealing with suicide should automatically be life-affirming and thus inherently anti-suicide. Your reality is not necessarily that of other people's and neither are your views and opinions. You have no right to impose your reality, views and opinions onto other people to the point of forcibly shoving it down their throats. I certainly do not have the right to do such things to you, which I'm sure you would agree with. So why does it appear that you think that you somehow do have the right to do that to me and other suicidal people?

I just went over to r/politics and opened the “Mueller subpoenas Trump organization post” and saw 13 Russian shill accusation in less than 3 minutes of browsing through the comments.

It's worth pointing out that the latest alpha iteration did make the external URL more obvious buy exposing more of the URL slug, and coloring it in that familiar blue hyperlink color. 

Personally, I agree with others who suggest that any attempt to de-emphasize external URL's will negatively impact click through and hence decreases the number of people who read the content. But I think you and I both know that they are not turning back from the current design where submission titles will open the thread.

Though they've already tried to compromise with the new exposed URL method, I think something similar to [/u/majorparadox's proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/81baxs/mockup_for_moving_new_url_links_under_the_title/) might be in order.

A shadowban is a status placed against your account that hides all of your submissions from **all users, in all subreddits,** except the moderators of the subreddit you are posting in, and to yourself hence shadowban as you aren't made aware of the fact nobody else can see your posts.

You're talking about automod rules being set up by the mod team to remove specific posts, and submissions, that they themselves configure and manage. This is not a shadowban. I agree that this is also an issue, but this is enforced by that subreddits modteam, and is really no different from them going in and silently removing your comments/posts without telling you.

I don't know - I suspect at *least* a year, maybe a few. There are some old options that reddit inc has allowed to keep running for a surprisingly long time (see: the reddit compact site). 

The problem becomes that there are a number of new features in the redesign that don't necessarily degrade gracefully to the 'old' site. One big one: emoji. The product team wants subreddits to phase out use of CSS 'image flair' in favor of 'emoji flair', which will be better standardized and visible to users on mobile. But on the 'old' site, that will only be visible as a :text: tag. 

There are more little things like that, which I suspect will pile up and make the 'old' site somewhat of a chore for users, mods and the design team themselves.

Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.

Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance.

* Somewhat sensible: Some people have very large widescreen monitors and browse fullscreen, and it truly is more difficult to read large blocks of text if the linewrap is 20inches away from line-end to line-beginning.

* From good to bad: Studies and articles (like these: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=optimal+line+length ) have long told page-layout designers to use a ~75 character maximum (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length#Printed_text). This is partially why dictionaries and newspapers have narrower-than-full-page-width columns (2 or 3 or 4 columns depending on page width). People who don't spend most of their waking hours reading text, seem to be more appreciative of this line-length (and people with vision problems and dyslexia too). People who want to fill their window no matter what width, are frustrated by this.

* Very frustrating: having a maximum width (even in a responsive design), makes it easier to make a semi-predictable layout, which is good for designers. This often leads to daft problems, e.g. most News websites.

* Diversity: Some people are overwhelmed by very dense text or UIs. They would rather scroll a lot, or have options hidden. This group includes both old-timers (who deal with constant frustration) and newcomers.

Which is good, as I would hate that. I often reopen the same content if it has a lot more comments. So fading should be comment based. 

The third is ""why are you still restricting the front page to 50 subreddits?"" I don't have more than that, so it's not a big deal to me. But surely the tech has evolved to where you can just include all the subreddits. 

The fourth is that you  need to take into account how some subreddits are specifically repetitious and only work because they have fewer subscribers. I actually did wind up unsubbing a subreddit that I had before almost never saw on my front page, maybe one per visit. But lately I started seeing more, and it annoyed me enough to unsub.

He had the domain [bits.are.notabug.com](http://archive.is/d4NPt) before reddit existed and

[not a bug](http://archive.is/eBNaf) was the name of reddit's parent company when it was acquired by Conde Nast.

T_D being banned is not about people liking them or not disliking them. It is the fact that they are spreading, in a **purposeful manner**, misinformation and propaganda meant to create chaos and sow distrust between americans. 

There is proof that the T_D has been pushing Russian propaganda, there is proof that the T_D has been pushing for violence and unrest, there is proof that T_D is sowing seeds of distrust.

for r//trees, all the users do there is smoke an unadulterated plant that grows freely in nature in many places in the world, and hang out being mellow after smoking it. They don't bother anyone, they are not spreading propaganda, they are not creating chaos, they are not pushing for violence.

Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law. In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain federal acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with federal law.

The pricing for Google, Yahoo, or Bing on a website are $4-5 per thousand queries.

How many queries are Redditors doing? It can't be that many if Reddit doesn't feel the imperative to implement a better internal query system.

The suggestion that I want them banned because I don't agree with them is ridiculous.

> If they truly are breaking rules then they would have been banned by now.

You'd think that, and that's why I'm not letting it go.

T_D was caught brigading, red-handed, multiple times. That's why they were pulled from the front page. And they have a long standing history of doxxing and witch-hunting as well as an ongoing racist component to the overall culture of the subreddit. I know this isn't hyperbole, because I spent a second on the sub, and I know it's a serious problem that Reddit is for whatever reason refusing to address, because I stayed longer than that.

I wish you wouldn't characterize my concerned position as being a whining crybaby who isn't getting what he wants. I'm not whining, and this isn't about what I want, it's about what I am deeply concerned is contributing to a shittier version of American culture.

I also wish you wouldn't parade free speech around as if it's a relevant issue here. The right to free speech is enshrined in the constitution, but the right to use privately-owned social media to broadcast and magnify hate speech is not constitutionally protected. And the idea that there is an exchange of ideas between people with opposing views is nonsensical. T_D is not exchanging ideas, they are polluting discourse and there is *ample* evidence that there are many people on T_D who are on the Russian payroll and who have been directed to stir shit up, who have been directed to start conversations like this one. They're trying to influence our country to be divided and afraid, and I don't feel it's whiny to be concerned about that.

These answers obviously only apply IAMA, but:

>If you don't mind me asking, how many hours a day did you have to do ""mod duties""?  

No required hours in IAMA. I typically had 2-3 hours of modding in a normal day while I was between task at work. Usually I'd just read AMAs and remove comments as needed, occasionally checking modmail to help people out. With IAMA, we also have to check out people's proof as well, and that usually happens in modmail or email.

>Were you working during it?  

Yea, this is how I slacked off at work. I had an IT support job then, but had a lot of downtime when stuff wasn't breaking.  

> Did you have any social life outside the internet?  

Yep. It didn't really impact my life much.  
>I'm imagining moderators as those who live in their parents house on their PCs all day, as that's the only way I can possibly imagine they'd be able to moderate- or do mods take ""shifts?""  

Lol. Our mods are mostly working professionals putting in a few hours a day. I don't think any of us live with our parents. IAMA in particular is mostly only active during work hours in the US which makes it easier for a dozen or so active mods to keep an eye on things when we have time. We have a couple mods based in asia/australia who cover the night shift pretty well - not much going on.

>Are there strict schedules/hours you're expected to keep up?

No. If a mod doesn't do any mod actions for a couple of months we usually check in and see if they're okay. We don't kick mods for inactivity. If we find that we're not able to keep up with things as a team, we recruit a few new mods.",False,False,False,137522,42355,1279857224.0,False,True

I've also witnessed conservatives attempt to defend their views and have their arguments completely unraveled. And threads where people within both parties are split on issues. That seems fine.

It's unfortunate that people use downvotes for anything they dislike, but reddit's Eternal September has made herding those cats impossible.

I'm not even going to begin to consider the problems that would arise from actually trying to enforce any site-wide method of keeping discussion of news open to all perspectives.

Looking at your opening reply:

>LOL is there any evidence that Trump didn't say anything because they're black, or is that just because the media told you Trump's a racist and you don't want to think for yourself?

You've probably been downvoted because you're coming off as flippant and letting your feelings about the community in general bleed through rather than simply calling the specific assertion into question.

""LOL"": Suggests that you think the entire premise, which the majority is running with, can't be taken seriously.  
""the media told you Trump's a racist and you don't want to think for yourself?"": Suggests that you don't believe Trump is racist - unpopular opinion in them parts - and that they wouldn't have deduced it from his words and actions.

You've called everyone's ability to think into question before engaging with anyone in particular - attacking them, and not the assertion. It comes off as rude, and sets the tone for the reply chain.

However, when someone replied (also somewhat flippantly), you continued to engage, asking for proof of their remarks - and since your post here, they bothered to check the accuracy of their statements, admitted they were wrong about something (?! THAT HAPPENED *AGAIN?!*), and provided an article to back up another one of their statements.

So while it may be harder to communicate, it *isn't impossible*, and it might've been easier to reach more people with careful phrasing. (""How do we know the victims' races are the reason Trump hasn't commented on the attacks? Can anyone share something to support that?"")

I'd advise you to stick around and keep calling out articles that jump to conclusions or contain questionable information - every individual fighting against a collective bias helps. Reaching someone is better than reaching no one, as someone can reach someone but no one can't reach someone, and also, no one can't reach someone if that someone is within reach of everyone, but if they have claustrophobia and they run fast enough that can turn into no one being able to reach someone *real* fast.",False,False,False,15495,3330,1325127777.0,False,True

I remember when I found Reddit in 2010 and the most likable thing about it was the ""hands-off"" policy. Reddit was able to be multiple different things with multiple different groups with multiple different political ideology. It wasn't the cesspool that 4chan was and it wasn't the higher-ups pushing what they wanted like Digg and it wasn't a social network like Facebook. It was Reddit where you can peer into cultures that you had no idea that existed.


This is so stupid. Really. For the first time in the 8 years when I have been visiting Reddit on an almost daily basis I want something better to come along. There used to be no other site like it. It was a site for adults, but it never crossed that threshold (as a whole) like 4chan.


I can't find the quote but in early Reddit days one of the founders said something similar to 'As long as a sub isn't breaking a federal law we will let it be. The moment we ban subs for any reason besides illegal activity would be the beginning of the end for Reddit.'


Congratulations. You just let a bunch of people who only care about limiting others fun dictate what this site does.


**e.** - [Here is a similar quote, second to last, with a bunch of other good quotes. I am trying to track down the source for the quote.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/dw2ofuz/)


**e. 2 -** Another reason I am disappointed in this is because those people will now move away from Reddit. I don't have any friends who value guns (not talking politically here, but like some people value baseball cards) so I don't get to here viewpoints from people who value guns and will most likely value other things that I don't. They will move away from Reddit and their opinions will too. So a simple thread in r/news will be missing a viewpoint that I wouldn't normally here. Different opinions and different viewpoints is what makes Reddit great to me. Forcing out viewpoints will make it less of a discussions/debate and more about cheerleading to each other.

r/Gundeals does more than link users to deals on firearms, as it's a great way to find sales on accessories. Was this considered when the decision was made?

They weren't](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/dw2dfqq/) )? Moreover, no firearms are sold on that subreddit.

It seems like a vain attempt to save face in light of Russian Trolls and Section 230 by censoring sensitive topics. Obviously Reddit is a private company and can filter whatever they want. However, I recall the Admins being quite adamant about preserving Net Neutrality since ""unapproved"" content could be filtered by ISPs.

If not for trolls or possible legislation regarding the internet, what is prompting this change of policy? Advertisers? Taking advantage of anti-gun sentiment? Appealing to a wider audience (so where does that leave porn subreddits and r/WTF)?

Seriously Reddit?! I can't believe you banned /r/gundeals! Gundeals and /r/gundealsFU were NEVER a marketplace for firearms, it's a collection of links to actual stores. You should seriously unban them! It's ridiculous that you're lumping gundeals in with other subs that facilitated illegal activities. Gundeals at no time ever violated or attempted to skirt any laws; everything was 100% in compliance with federal and local laws as **/r/gundeals was simply just a springboard for coupons and deal alerts** and all transactions took place off Reddit through the proper and licensed channels.

**In NO WAY were there any illegal activities happening on /r/gundeals.** It was a great community full of people who just wanted to help others. I learned so much from the great group of people who made that community what it was. /r/gundeals was the #1 reason I visited Reddit.

/r/gundealsFU was literally just a sub for reviews! Only text, images and links to Imgur were ever posted there, specifically about past purchases and experiences with the many companies that would post on, or end up on, via user submitted links, /r/gundeals.

This leaves such a bad taste in my mouth as I know it does for everyone else here too. You have ruined what made Reddit so great in the first place. I've been a member on here for years but only recently rediscovered what made Reddit so great. You just took that away.

Did you even give /r/gundeals a chance to review your new shitty policies before banning them? They could easily just remove firearm and ammo deals from postings since the majority of deals posted there were for accessories anyway! The very fact that you blanket banned /r/gundeals and /r/gundealsFU tells me you simply wanted to ban all gun related content for the sake of it; or because that's now the popular thing to do. You're not doing it for any noble cause no matter how badly you want it to look that way. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

your new site policy concerning the exchange of goods is going to do much more harm than good, as well as showing you to be corporate sellouts.

>Firearms, ammunition, or explosives;

this is legitimate and you are most likely just covering your asses, thinking the austin bomber got his parts off of here. you are most likely wrong but lets just assume you are for the sake of this argument. With that being said, you are letting one bad apple ruin the bunch.

>Drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, or any controlled substances (except advertisements placed in accordance with our advertising policy);

do you see the problem here? you are just downright admitting that you are selling out. and not only that, with these subreddits now gone, you have just greatly increased the risk factor of these services as opposed to people making well informed choices. How much did the DEA or big pharma pay you for this?

>Paid services involving physical sexual contact

yet your sex markets subreddit is still up which in itself is the selling of sexual contact. hypocrite

>Stolen goods;

you know what, that one is fair. i'll give you that one.

>Personal information;

so like you do to advertisers?

>Falsified official documents or currency

i take it you should now ban /r/cryptocurrency as well?

your policy changes are only going to hurt the company as well as lose you users. but that paycheck must be really nice. hypocrite. you do not stand for the users, you stand only for your paycheck. how much was it, i hope it was enough for you to live with yourself, you have unintentionally just killed people through a lack of information.

As one of the moderators of /r/CanadagunsEE, I have to say this is very disappointing. What was the point of shutting us down?

We were not a ""illegal market"" or doing anything wrong. Each poster has been licensed and extensively vetted by the RCMP(national police force of canada), which includes being ran through the background check database every single day to ensure continuous eligibility.

No illegal items were sold, members verified each other's license status(and each member was approved by the moderating team, it was not an open forum), and it complied with all of the quite strict laws canada has regarding firearms ownership, selling, trading, etc. The RCMP were contacted about anyone trying to do illegal activity.

Restricted firearms were registered with the RCMP, and transfers of registration/transportation permits/etc were done in accordance with the Firearms Act.

I would have assumed that being in compliance with the strict laws and checks in Canada would be enough to allay any concerns Reddit might have.

I get it, you guys need money to keep the website going. That's fair. What isn't fair is banning any sort of buy/sell/trade that you don't get paid for. Reddit is a forum, and a pretty secure one at that, where you can meet people from all over and, if both parties agree, conduct business to, say, trade gear for a hobby, or in the case of r/cigars, sample local flavors.

I'm here to plead my case, and that's you banning r/airsoftmarket.

The subreddit was dedicated to the exchanging of airsoft guns. Airsoft guns are electric or low-pressure-gas-powered replicas of real firearms. They're used in airsoft and MilSim, as a sport where teamwork and coordination are required to be great, and even a sport SWAT and military use for training and recreation. 

The sub was banned because the admins clearly believe it's for selling firearms. Well, airsoft guns are not firearms. By law, they're actually considered replicas, not firearms. That's why anyone with a couple hundred bucks and a state ID can go out and buy one or order one online without needing any sort of license or tax stamp for high capacity mags, barrel lengths, etc. 

Since airsoft guns don't fall under firearm laws, why should a sub dedicated to airsoft guns also fall under a rule regarding firearms? 

Also, the aforementioned security aspect I mentioned is why people use this site for it. By banning a sub for exchanging gear related to a sport, you're essentially driving traffic away from this website, as other forums will have to accommodate potential users.

I highly doubt the admins will even see this, but I'm pleading my case: Airsoft guns don't fall under firearm laws, so why should the new rule apply to them?",False,False,False,259574,9812,1353596780.0,False,False

I am disgusted by this move. You have fallen into what every other large USER CONTENT BASED company has fallen into lately: GREED. Facebook became trash because of greed. YouTube, once a great platform for anyone that wanted to make a video, now censors and polices content because of GREED. These companies have gone from caring about their user to caring about money in the now. What you fail to realize is that money, while it may increase now, has doomed your company to die. It's happening to Facebook now. How can you not see what has happened? Masses of people have stoned using it because it became a money generating tool instead of a content generating tool. And the money generating tool gets worn out *fast*. 

Please, reconsider this. It's in your own interest. Do not become the social media platforms that I and countless other users came to Reddit to escape. 

Furthermore it disgusts me u/spez that you couldn't even be bothers to post this yourself. You knew there would be backlash. And you didn't want to have to think about the people behind each and every one of these accounts. You don't want to feel how upset the PEOPLE are. These aren't just usernames. Behind each one is a human being just like YOU. And you were a spineless, greedy, unempathetic person when you didn't post this yourself and had a faceless corporate account do it.

It is unfair how you enacted and enforced this policy. You did so on a whim without any warning to any of the communities affected by it, without the input of the Reddit community itself, and immediately blanket-banned a whole bunch of thriving communities, many with good intentions, practically as soon as the rule was written. You didn't even give them time to make a backup!

I get your goal here, and I respect it, but you went about it all wrong.

I say you retract this rule and the bans on the affected subs until such time that you work it out with your community, else you're setting a precedent for how the community feels about how Reddit will treat its users and communities in the future. Once you've worked out a reasonable medium that works for both parties, and given people time to adjust, -then- you can start carefully enforcing the new rules, as opposed to blatantly as you just did.

We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

Not trying to be insulting/conspiratorial, but as a ""pro-gun guy"" (have been shooting competitively for 2 decades, own two legal fully automatic weapons, suppressors, short barreled rifles, etc) I'm curious as to what your ideal situation would be on gun-control. Is it eventual forced confiscation, making it near impossible to own anything outside of a hunting rifle and only being able to shoot at registered gun clubs? Do you think that anyone who owns a firearm is total scum and a piece of shit? 

I ask those not to be condescending or to start a fight, but rather because it sounds like that's not the kind of pro-gun control person you are. And in fact most people I know who would call themselves ""anti-gun"" or whatever generally don't even go as far as thinking semi-automatic rifles should be banned, and most agree resources should be used to beef up the background check/mental health check system before wasting resources on buzz-word type items. 

That said, there is a smaller group of people in the ""anti-gun"" society that has built some of their identity around the complete and total banning of firearms and demonetization of anyone who owns a firearm or thinks differently. They thrive off the buzz-words like automatic (just a side note my fully automatic UZI cost $9,000 and took 9 months to get and later my M16A2 cost $20,000 and took 13 months to get approved by the ATF, very few people actually have automatic guns), high capacity, assault weapon, military style, silenced (suppressed guns are still really loud), etc. And it seems to many of us that while most of the left at least in the United States doesn't fall into this group at all, the ones that do seem to hold quite a bit of sway over content distribution and commerce. Youtube, google, facebook, reddit, the owners/C-suite all seems to be run by this far left ideology when it comes to firearms. 

A great way to say this is that the far left isn't an accurate representation of the average left-wing person, but it is an accurate representation of the current leadership of the left. The fact that Reddit as a predominately left wing user base has down voted this thread to the point where I can't even see a score makes me think reddit really is like this from an ownership/management style. I say this because I think the average reddit user is generally okay with firearm ownership and is willing to have a reasonable conversation on policy as well as just to be educated on the mechanics and history of the firearms themselves, but the way the site is going eventually that wont even be allowed.

So what is the reasoning behind that?  Oh yeah, don't have to have any reasoning, we have this big hammer.

Hey even if a kid found his way onto the site, and managed to hang around long enough and make enough comments to be viewed as a legit member (you could NOT just sign into the site and then arrange to sell or trade on the site, you had to prove your bona fides to do so), he had to already have pipe tobacco to trade for other tobacco.  And as for buying tobacco, well why would he seek out a site to pay a premium price (for premium tobacco of course) when he could buy it cheaper through other on line sites?  Besides when was the last time you saw a kid smoking a pipe?  Kids smoke cigarettes, or possibly cigarillos, or if from North Carolina they chew.  But they don't smoke pipes, not with tobacco anyway.

We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

1. Because most of subs weren't actually doing anything illegal. R/Shoplifting was posts about getting away with stealing from a store, getting caught stealing from a store, and advice about how to steal from a store; the posts weren't illegal acts they were *about* illegal acts. The darknet were strictly moderated to ensure that **no transactions** took place on the sub. All they posted were reviews of sellers and info on how to reach & use markets.  
2. The drug subs **did not allow** transactions, just information *about* various drugs and where to buy them.  
3. The firearms related sites either had nothing to do with buying and selling guns (empty shell casings, sale of accessories, *links* to sales) or were modded to ensure that **all transactions** were in compliance with federal law.  
4. The alcohol and tobacco subs allowed members to swap or buy hard to find products and (some) held occasional give-aways and contests. They *might* have been violating some law against unlicensed sale, but minors are unlikely to be looking for a micro-brewed, seasonal, Belgian ale from Oregon; a small batch, peaty, 12 year old Scotch from Islay; or a hand-rolled, long leaf, Nicaraguan Toro with a shaded Connecticut wrapper.  
5. Reddit continues to allow *paid advertising* of the very things they banned subs for trading in. Which brings us to the primary reason for the anger.  
6. The was **no notice**. Most of these subs had been around for years. They had built up a loyal membership (some 10,000+), accumulated a large library of resources, didn't interfere with any other sub, were politically & socially neutral, and had fostered many on-line friendships.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

I can almost guarantee that there will be autoplay videos coming, embedded adverts, and real name profiles. I wrote this in response to the facebook stuff and how reddit will be turning into facebook soon.

This is semi-relevant but this isn't so much a response to recent tragedies but rather a moving forward of eventual plans. So here's a very long comment I've been working on and isn't quite finished so skip to the end for the point.

The Socialization of Reddit

Reddit as I’m sure, or at least hope you know since this is a comment on reddit, is a website but what sort of website? Well going off of [CGP Greys video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlI022aUWQQ) from 2013 reddit was a link aggregation site with a comment section. Actually that seems and feels fairly accurate to what I considered reddit to be when I first joined and chances are you did to. So let us define it as such;

**Reddit: A user controlled link aggregation site with a comments section.**

It isn’t a unique concept but the implementation and utilitarian design made it pretty popular with nerds as well as benefiting from the snowball effect which meant it had enough content to keep people coming so more content kept being made so more people kept coming. So without a doubt the most important thing for reddit above all else is CONTENT. If users stopped submitting the site dies. Fast. A weekend protest of a dozen or so big subreddits is huge news and something you wake the CEO up to respond to but the blackout 2015 isn’t what this post is about.

So what is reddits business model? Well there are two main revenue streams;

Reddit gold: User can pay to have to gift reddit gold which holds with it some features

Advertising: Allowing companies to put adverts on reddit

How many BIG sites do you know that offer a gold type thing? Youtube is the biggest with ‘youtube red’ but others? As far as I’m aware Twitter, Facebook and pretty much every major site doesn’t offer this. The revenue stream is too small. It is however sold as 

“Reddit Gold gives you extra features and helps keep our servers running.“

It is actively sold as a way for reddit to keep the server up. Great the users get to directly fund the operation of the site and receive benefits in return which can often be great for the user. The trouble with this is typically if the server cost grows without a userbase growth then eventually you fail to meet operational costs. So sites will often move to reduce server overhead without a loss in quality reddit has done the opposite they moved to host their own images in [July 2016]( https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) and video hosting in [June 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanVideos/comments/6joshn/introducing_video_hosting_on_reddit/)

This will obviously cost them a ton more money to do so why do it rather than let imgur/youtube do the work? Centralization. A social media site wants to keep people on the site not just using the site but never leaving it both facebook and twitter host their own pictures and videos because they do not want to relinquish control it also allows them to place adverts (including video ones) on their site and collect more data. It is fundamental to their operation as a social network that all interaction not only goes through them but is handled by them.

On this note comes mobile applications. Most users are on phones and/or tablets so you as a social network want them using your applications. Facebook and Twitter are notoriously hostile to other applications because its a point in the network not handled by them which means they can’t monitor you even closer.

This brings us onto the reddit app situation there’s no shortage of applications for reddit most of which are excellent the trouble with them was they aren’t owned by reddit. So first you make an app I found their announcement page and couldn’t find any information on why but suffice to say the most transparent short term reason is;

* We want more advertising revenue

Now there’s nothing wrong with that. They as a site need to make money, I need to make money if that means sucking some dick so be it. The long term reason is;

*We want to have complete control from beginning to end with the interactions people make not only with content but each other. 

If the reddit app gets big enough the need to support external developers goes down. Companies love control. What will happen wouldn’t be instant but rather simple

1. Features get added without informing developers so the unofficial apps are bad for short periods of time. This is a headache for developers to deal with as it often means having to work long hours and results in a worse app.

2. Poor documentation of new API’s (if there’s new ones at all) which results in a worse unofficial app

3. API’s not receiving the attention they have previously causing issues which results in a worse unofficial app

4. Eventually the announcement is made that the public API is being restricted because of the above 3 steps and how the API is now out of date, causes issues and holds back further development of reddit. Backlash is minimized because the quality of the unofficial apps have gone down.

Okay so we have our users locked into the site on the web and into our applications but that’s fucking pointless if accounts are anonymous and unlinked. What you need is a profile, an identity which allows people to post to it sort of like a personal subreddit… well what do you know we have that since [March 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/60p3n1/tldr_today_were_testing_out_a_new_feature_that/)

This was one of the [examples](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shitty_Watercolour) used

It’s eerily similar to a twitter/facebook page is it not? A ‘personal’ I.e. real name profile will be very similar except with more information such as DOB/LOCATION/JOB and instead of active in communities you’ll see something like ‘personal pages’ or some branded terms where a user posts stuff about a holiday to Barcalena. Internally this is probably being marketed as

“Instagram but more than photos, youtube but more than videos, twitter/facebook but more than text” this pages and updates will more seamlessly integrate photos, text, video just like reddit has been doing forever and what it excels at. 

Last step on this process is design. Reddit is an ugly complicated piece of shit. Small buttons, no colour. I love it, infact for me it’s TOO user friendly. But for the people they are looking to attract it needs to be SIMPLE. Real fucking simple. So first it needs to be simple to type which means markdown has to die. LaTeX isn’t the most popular document maker, markdown isn’t the most popular webtext input device. Markdown will die. This has already started. They have introduced a RTE. No one has really asked for it as markdown isn’t too complicated but still. Now onto the grander scale reddit will go through a MAJOR redesign. This will mean big pictures, icons and as little information on screen as possible. They are pretty transparent about why “Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors” they just don’t discuss the long term goals.

https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif

That’s the new reddit, it’ll have autoplaying videos, embedded advertising disguised as posts and all sorts of stuff you’ve come to expect from every single shitty social network.

This began around August 2015 and is probably a part of a four year plan to turn reddit into a full blown social network. Behind doors meeting it is being sold as;

**New reddit: A life aggregation site with a comments section**

So let us look at what’s been discussed in a brief overview

* **Centralization**; Ensuring control of reddit from beginning to end of interactions

* **Profiling**; Ensuring a large dataset for improved advertising revenue

* **User Interface**; Ensuring a site that can be accessed by everyone especially to key demographics.

Everything is in place, it’s just a case of integrating the ideas, releasing the redesign and slowly withdrawing the public API’s. 

There are additional things to add but most are small points that don’t contribute much to the overall picture because they aren’t as necessary these include

1. Messaging will probably be changed to chat windows akin to facebook

2. A discord esque system or even reddit purchasing discord for VOIP and video calls.

3. **A community cleanup of communities that tarnish the brand but otherwise don’t violate the rule**

You need to have the actual firearm transferred to an FFL dealer (actual store/someone who has gotten a license to sell), it CANNOT be sent directly to a home, it must go to a business address.  I am hazy on local sales (meaning within the state) through the mail, but I believe that it is similar.

Proof that you can do it: https://www.gunbroker.com/

Note on what constitutes a firearm:

Accessories are not regulated, meaning optics, grips, parts, etc.  

I believe all ammunition, but at least handgun, requires 21+ to accept delivery to a home address (alcohol is similar in this regard). Rifle ammo might be 18+, but its been a minute since I bought rifle in bulk online.

Certain components, such as upper receivers for ARs, 80% lower receivers for ARs, grips, stocks, fore-ends, trigger groups, (I believe) barrels, and other items are unregulated.  The big one is AR lower receivers.  Pretty decent rule of thumb is that if it has a serial number, then it goes to an FFL.

Why are you bothering to get in the way of some of the communities on here in the first place? Not your responsibility, apparently.

I wish reddit admins would take a much, much more hands off approach. The activities of a subreddit are the responsibility of it's members and moderators. Reddit admins should just manage the tech stack and tooling.

Edit: before more people armchair lawyer at me, unless you can provide a link to some statute or another clearly stating how a platform is held responsible for the crimes of its users, don't bother. Secondly, I'm not even of the opinion that the above is a reasonable path. I do know however, that the more hands off a platform, the more legal buffer they have.

> But because it was the Internet, the posts were anonymous. So instead, the firm sued Prodigy, the online service that hosted the bulletin board.


>Prodigy argued it couldn't be responsible for a user's post — like a library, it could not liable for what's inside its books. Or, in now-familiar terms: It's a platform, not a publisher.

somebody writes a platform where free speech can happen. people come and build a culture. some big company sees clicks, buys the site, but doesn't understand the culture, and imposes censorship after averse publcity. then people leave, and look for a platform where free speech can happen.

I will say one thing: No, of course I don't think everyone who owns a gun is scum. I said I'm pro gun control, not anti-gun. There are legitimate reasons to own guns, and it's also just a hobby for fun, like anything else--as long as it's practiced safely.

I just don't mind if a private company wants to not be involved in the firearms trade. I get not wanting to take the possible liability problem. If you're not a business designed around being able to sell potentially problematic items, it makes sense to limit your liability. 

The problem I have here is the implementation. When I first saw the policy update, it sounded reasonable. My disdain only came after I saw from the comments of how it is being implemented--how little the administration seemed to care about Reddit's users. There were obvious things they could have done to soften the blow, and to give people a chance to adapt to the new rules. But they didn't. (And past experience shows they won't reverse their decision.)

And, again, that's in stark contrast to how much they do everything they can to avoid having to get rid of a certain other subreddit--one that is far, far worse.

They have repeatedly been caught sending death threats.

""Hi - I'm writing today to respectfully request that Reddit reconsider its decision to ban the r/gundeals community. I have been a very active member in that community and am very disappointed to see it go.

I believe it's critically important to distinguish r/gundeals - which did not permit or facilitate the direct sale of firearms or ammunition between individuals.

The r/gundeals community was a place for users to submit links to good deals offered by legitimate third-party retailers - the key being that the deal link had to be to a legitimate retailer who would naturally be responsible for compliance with all applicable state & federal laws. For example, if a user found a sale on duck hunting ammunition at Walmart, a link to that sale on Walmart's website would be permitted on r/gundeals. However, an individual wanting to sell a firearm or ammunition in a private transaction would not be permitted to post on r/gundeals under any circumstances.

To use Facebook as a comparison: FB has banned the private sale of firearms by individuals for some time now, but they still allow legitimate retailers / dealers to post sales information. Here, r/gundeals simply acted as a user-generated aggregator of links to those good deals from retailers like Walmart, Academy, Amazon, and many others - all retailers that are required to follow numerous state & federal laws in connection with the sale of firearms and ammunition.

In sum, r/gundeals did not facilitate or solicit private and/or unregulated transactions of any kind involving firearms or ammunition; rather, it simply acted as a place for users to find good deals from online retailers. Bearing all of that in mind, again, I would respectfully request that Reddit reconsider its decision to ban r/gundeals - we are a community of law-abiding, conscientious outdoorsmen (and women), I believe the mods of r/gundeals can & will work with Reddit to satisfy your concerns, we just ask for the chance to have that conversation with you.

Thank you in advance for your consideration""",False,False,False,956,603,1379425709.0,False,False

>**Is it illegal to sell or rent M (Mature) or AO (Adults Only) rated games to customers under 17 and 18 years of age respectively?**

>A ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 (Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association/Entertainment Software Association) found that video games are a constitutionally-protected form of expression, and that laws restricting their sale or rental based upon violent content are unconstitutional. That said, ESRB supports retailers' voluntary policies restricting the sale or rental of M (Mature) and AO (Adults Only) computer and video games in the United States and Canada to customers who are at least 17 and 18 years of age, respectively (unless permission from a parent has been obtained). Through efforts such as the ESRB Retail Council (ERC) and a strong commitment on the part of major video game retailers, retail stores have vastly improved the rate at which they comply with their store policies, as measured both by the ERC mystery shopper audits as well as audits conducted by the FTC. More information on federal, state and local regulations in the U.S. is available through the websites of the Entertainment Merchants Association (EMA) and Entertainment Software Association (ESA). In Canada, you may contact the Entertainment Software Association of Canada (ESA Canada) or the Retail Council of Canada (RCC).

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

The whole reason why I have moved from Facebook and Instagram to Reddit and Snapchat is because I want to get away from embedded advertising. I want to get away from having fake fucking internet points determine whether or not I deserve to exist as a fucking human being. Fuck basing self-worth on fucking social media! I use social media in 3 ways: 1. To stay in touch with people I do not see on a daily basis (and I'm really bad with that). 2. Chatting with people that I don't see on a daily basis or using it as a way to coordinate with people to hang out with them or on projects, 3. To waste my time by looking at funny or interesting shit online because it is pleasurable to see and way more meaningful to see than other people's feeds. Reddit is that third option! Reddit was a place I came to get away from the bullshit of popularity and points determining your worth. Still I think this is indicative of the internet in general, instead of being the ""information superhighway"" that it was advertised to you and me as being, I can see the tendrils of every major corporation finding every single way to monetize, advertise, and completely decimate the original promise of the internet. How long before Google requires the viewing of ads to get on to fucking Wikipedia? How long before every other post on Facebook becomes embedded advertising? How long before the entirety of the internet becomes a collective Plato's Cave of the modern world. Where information is only free if you are willing to watch ads or willing to pay for it. Net Neutrality is already going to break it up and further inflate the costs of the internet.

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

I started a couple ""subreddits"" on the site. I did one for nature illustration, and iirc I also created a sub for freelance workers. (I've totally forgotten what Voat's ""subreddit"" equivalent is called.)

Thought it might be cool to get in on a social media app on the ground floor, see if it gets big, try something new.

(tl;dr: Lots of legal liability issues which is probably why there's some concern especially with Section 230 going away, and especially with zealous prosecutors they probably think the forums aren't worth it)

In regards to firearms, different countries have different regs on firearms and firearm categories (most being stricter on handguns, and some restricting certain shotguns as well).  In some countries (Switzerland comes to mind, but there are others) the actual possession of ammunition is restricted (which could be why the reloader forums got targeted).  Even in the US the regs for possession of handguns are kind of a patchwork (some areas require a police permit to possess a handgun, and this goes all the way down to county level in some cases like Illinois and New York).

Similar issues exist with firearms accessories.  There are states that restrict magazine size; New Jersey actually has a law on the books that requires all firearms be sold with biometric safety once this becomes feasible to do so; there are countries that restrict mods to firearms, and I honestly won't be entirely surprised to see laws restricting mod kits for long rifles to make them look ""tacti-cool"" in some states in future.

Alcohol is another sticky widget--not just because of the crazy quilt that exists in a lot of states of dry/various forms of ""moist"" ranging from ""only 3.2 beer allowed"" to ""only allows sales on-premise at a distillery"" to ""beer only"" to ""beer and spirits only allowed to be sold and drank on premise"" to ""can only be sold to members of private clubs""/wet, but also specific laws regarding quantities sold and who can legally sell and how it can be legally transported.  Some states actually prohibit package sales except on-premise at a distillery/brewery or through a warehouse store; some states actually have an ""ABC Store"" setup through their own state division of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms which run all sales in the state; quite a lot of places have distinct licenses for wine and spirits and distinct restrictions on whom can sell (many states effectively ban wine and spirits sales outside of a winery/distillery, a liquor store, or a licensed drugstore and even grocery stores selling wine must have a physically separated ""wine store"" not part of the main premises); a number of states actually prohibit alcohol being shipped directly (via UPS/FedEx/USPS) to a customer and require all alcoholic beverages be shipped to a warehouse or distributor.  In some states there are actually minimum and maximum quantities that can legally be sold (for example, Pennsylvania's former infamous law on where one could buy a six-pack of beer versus a case).

And then there's the cannabis stuff; ranging from ""rec legal"" to various flavours of med legal (from ""can possess with a card and can go to a dispensary"" to ""prescription only, must possess card, must get from a specific licensed pharmacy and vapable/smokeable products are illegal"" to ""CBD oil products only"" to ""CBD oil only, only for certain epilepsy syndromes of childhood and must be obtained through clinical trial at state university"" to flat-out illegal.  

Tobacco and vapes are also surprisingly dicey legally.  Several states are starting to restrict vape sales and proposals have been made to tax vape fluid (similarly to tobacco taxes); First Nations groups sometimes will sell essentially ""duty free"" cigarettes off-rez (let's just say the state of New York and the Oneida First Nation have been in fairly regular legal fisticuffs about this exact thing).

With the upcoming demise of Section 230 (through FOSTA), pretty much online forums are going to be open to prosecutors that Want To Make A Mark.  In the states with more restrictive laws on handguns and gun accessories, some DA is going to try to go after someone posing links to (for example) a 30-round aftermarket kit for a Ruger .22 LR or selling a firearm to someone on a state internal ""red flag"" list or that was a straw purchase online; in the more, ahem, gun-friendly but controlled-substances-unfriendly states probably a DA is going to go after (say) someone in KY (where ship-to-customer is still effectively illegal and online sales of alcohol are illegal) being sold beer from someone in Wisconsin (where online sales and ship-to-customer are legal), or a dispensary in Colorado selling CBD oil selling to an Indiana customer (in IN one can only use CBD oil for childhood epilepsy syndromes and one must obtain from the clinical trial ongoing by Indiana University).  NY will probably want to go after ANYONE purchasing tobacco online from the Oneida Reservation's online shop without paying NY state tax.

I didn't know about the duct tape thing in Oregon. I grew up in Oregon and that caught me by surprise. So I hopped on Amazon to see if they restrict duct tape sales. Using an old Oregon address, I was able to check out with some duct tape in my cart. Looks like Amazon doesn't care, either.

Handloading or reloading is the process of loading firearm cartridges or shotgun shells by assembling the individual components (case/hull, primer, powder, and bullet/shot), rather than purchasing completely assembled, factory-loaded ammunition. The term handloading is the more general term, as it refers to assembly of ammunition using components from any source. Reloading refers more specifically to the assembly of ammunition re-using cases or shells from previously fired ammunition. The terms are often used interchangeably, as the techniques are largely the same whether using new or previously fired components.

For the sake of being quick, in my mind saying ""That guy fucking sucks because he has brown hair."" is completely acceptable. So is something like ""You're a fucking idiot."" unless the subreddit forbids it. Saying ""Everyone should throw rocks at every brown haired person they see."" and ""I can't wait to beat the shit out of someone."" wouldn't be allowed.


Some people believe that words can violent without the threat of physical violence. The people who disagree with this will say something like ""Everyone gets offended too easily anymore."" But, what I believe to be the truth, is that people get offended all the time. So many different things offend so many different people that we would have to take away freedoms to not offend someone or people will be in trouble for offending someone they didn't mean to.


[I just read this article today that really offended me.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/glanton/ct-met-white-privilege-dahleen-glanton-20180328-story.html) Should this writer of this article be punished because I am offended? I don't believe so. She has the right to have her opinion and to voice it. It is my responsibility, as a person, to handle the feeling of being offended. People will be offended and get their feelings hurt on an almost daily basis. They should either deal with those feelings or avoid places when they will be hurt or offended.


People who disagree with me usually believe in a right to be comfortable over the right of expression. The problem I have with that is the power of a word comes from the listener, not the speaker. If Person A thought 'jerk' was the worst insult they could say to someone, but Person B thought 'jerk' was just a silly word and Person A screamed JERK at Person B they most likely wouldn't be offended. If Person C told Person A that they were a jerk for some trival reason than Person A would be offended.


There is no right way to actually classify offense because the power of a word belongs to the person hearing the word and not the person giving the word. Sure, you can try and maybe get a few 'universally' agreed on words, but the power of a word changes throughout time. 'Retard' used the be a medically accurate term, but now it is deemed as offesnive. In America calling someone a 'cunt' will make the loudest room fall silent whereas in Australia no one would ever give a second thought.


Imagine the divide between, already fragile, cultures if we started trying to police 'offense'.

Its complete hypocrisy that when one claims they are ""tolerant"" ""open-minded"" and so on, just to cry out for banning a political sub they can easily ignore.

They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement.

Put me in charge of one group that has a conflict with another group... and I'm out of my depth.

I do think that diversity and inclusivity are important goals - which is actually part of the reason I think safe spaces are a luxury that we can barely afford. I'd prefer to see people grow stronger, through dealing with the adversity of being presented with different personalities and worldviews. But I realize that that's easy for someone who's already strong in that area to say. I haven't ever known the weakness that some 'easily offended' people (no matter their privilege or politics) seem to show. And do I really know what they need to grow stronger? I'm really only reasonably sure what *I* need.

Plus there's the question of what to do with people that deliberately act in a divisive manner. Do we charitably assume that they just don't understand the value of helping people, or at the very least avoiding hurting them? Do we treat them with kid gloves, even at an age when we might reasonably expect them to have grown the fuck up? Would it help to be tough on them? Would it help to go soft?

I do think that delibrately trying to cause offense (aka trolling) is a bad tactic. I would definitely try to draw some sort of line between that, and accepting that offense will be caused in pursuit of righting an injustice (aka human rights.) That's why I think that groups like PETA support a noble cause (animal rights) and I will still condemn them for reprehensible tactics.",False,False,False,63050,8316,1343534650.0,False,False

We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

>Not all states allow private sales, and some have certain restrictions that you should be aware of. For example, in California private sales must be completed through licensed firearm dealers. Connecticut requires the person making the transfer to get an authorization number before such sales can be completed, and forbids the transfer of long guns unless certain conditions are met. A number of other states have similar restrictions. **It is also illegal to sell a firearm to a resident of another state without going through a dealer, and sellers cannot ship directly to (non-FFL) buyers in another state.** Selling to convicted felons and any other prohibited purchaser is illegal as well.

Here is the thing: reddit, while huge, is still a rather small, nerdy community compared to others. I know so many people who never even browsed reddit and who don't know much about it other than it's ""some sort of forum"" - but most of these people do use facebook, have an instagram or twitter account, etc.

Can't find the source but I read that about 60% of reddit’s visitors/users are from the US, between the age of 18-30. [Facebook](https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/) has roughly 2.13 billion users, according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/50vvk7/how_many_people_use_reddit_do_we_have_numbers_on/) reddit only has 234 million unique users - so there is a lot of room to grow.

Even if all the people stop using reddit who would hate these new changes, tons of new people would take their place and reddit would still continue to grow. And from what I've seen across other social media platforms, even with shit changes people tend to stay - either because alternatives suck or because there are none. Reddit can only win this. Hardly anyone is willing to boycott any community because there are too many things one would miss out on. So in the end people just adapt.

It's not like reddit is essential to survive, but it does offer some things you can't find elsewhere on the internet just yet. There are quite a few really good subreddits that provide quality content, e.g. r/AskHistorians, r/AskHistory, any AMA related subreddit, r/science, r/DIY, and all those small special communities that use reddit as a central platform to exchange ideas for various projects, etc.

All of this isn't just entertainment but a central, international contact point for people with similar interests - imagine if this would go back to old school forums. A lot of the entire reddit experience would get lost. I'm still commenting on forums here and there but it's not really the same for various reasons and it splits up the community into very small chunks that makes it difficult to communicate because you need to make seperate accounts and so on.

So if people leave, not only will they miss out on that content, but it also will contribute to the smaller subs shutting down slowly. Because the major influx of users will only focus on mainstream subs with mainstream content, niche content never really survives when the mainstream consumer discovers a new product/service.

So what then? I don't know. But I'm not 100% I would leave the moment reddit becomes facebook 2.0 - not until there is a way I can stay in touch with those tiny communities that bring me joy every week with interesting, detailed stories or ideas. And that is going to be impossible because there is no similar platform like reddit where everyone can move to, plus it will tear communities apart because some will want to stay.

Imagine if the frontpage of reddit was empty of good content... not just for a few hours but a week. That vacuum will cause a mass migration bigger than any user walkout. Voat, 4chan, others will grow massively in the process and now be content competitors.

Making the website open-source and hackable is a must to keep the website viable in the long run (one of the main flaws of reddit) 

A paywall is probably the way to go, you'd also be able to get some donations to help get it off the ground. It might be possible to decentralize the hosting as well, maybe allow for subreddits to be hosted and ratified by the community somehow. Democracy will help the site to keep its users, and probably appeal to people switching from Reddit.

The biggest challenge is going to be getting content. Perhaps there could be a tie-in to the reddit API (which would have to be browser-side), so you could browse reddit subs from the site, but allow for our own comment section. Maybe even mix them, but value our votes over reddit votes to give our smaller community the feeling of size, but also coherency?

Using the same API for every front end is also a great idea.

It probably wouldnt be too hard to implement, but I wouldn't really be able to help, either, as I'm just a 1st year CS student myself.

I don't think it would cost much at all to run, though. You could probably make it so the website's free until ~2,000 users, and at that point you'd have enough momentum to start charging $1 month for new users. (market it as like first 500 users get first year free, users after that get first 1 or two months free, depending on what momentum would be) AWS would be perfect so that we could eat a reddit exodus event and not suffocate under server load like Voat did.

We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

Don't you get it? It doesn't matter what the other guy did. Actions have an intrinsic value. I know it's not always possible to be 100% certain whether or not something is good or bad, but equally well it's not compulsory to keep score against the ""other"" side before you can express an opinion.

I obviously am not a fan of extreme right (or left) wing propaganda. You then come along and say ""Ahah, but what about left (or right) wing propaganda?"" What about it? Do I have to condemn every last little thing that a reasonable person might condemn before I'm allowed an opinion on one of those things?

(This is basically the sub-text of our interaction above. You feel I'm hypocritical for not decrying left wing propoganda, whereas I'm actually just lazy, and I was posting using my phone, and didn't want to write a whole essay.)

How is this hypocritical? I should be able to express a strong opinion on animal cruelty without also having to state my opposition to deforestation.

What I might say is ""Why on earth are you talking about the rainforest? Can't we just agree that animal cruelty is bad, without introducing some other topic?"" and, even if we disagree, and you think that animal cruelty is great, then why can't we discuss that on its merits without bringing deforestation into it?

For the record, I'm not a fan of extreme politics of any flavour. You've found a couple of sub-reddits which you feel are bastions of left wing propaganda. Great - I'm very pleased for you. Well done. Now, how does this invalidate my point which, before you started your what-a-boutery competition, was that Reddit has taken the time and trouble to ban people swapping craft beers, yet is happy to allow extreme right wing (and, for the record left wing) propaganda?

I don't use other social networks so I don't know what they allow.  But theoretically if facebook disallows posting pictures of petrol (gasoline for us) cars because they are against them does that make it right?

People just hate change. And if they worked with Google or something, we know that google could skew their search results to eliminate any real competition that garners random traffic away from Reddit. 

I could keep going but it all just stinks. Their is no transparency and this just looks like personal decisions on what to ban. Its a wide sweeping policy that kinda lets them pick and choose while having this to back up why it happened even if its not justified at all, like your case.

One other thing.. banning your sub alone sucks. But to not let you back up the info and work gathered beforehand is unreal. They must still have the data stored.

Is r/shoplifting one of them?   Completely subjective 

Should a subreddit be banned *under* the reason for “breaking the rules” even though it didn’t break any?   No, because they did not violate any rules

Did r/shoplifting ever talk about illegal activities?  Of course 

Was anything discussed or said in dialogue in r/shoplifting *in itself* technically considered illegal?   No

Was any form or incitement ever discussed within the subreddit? No

Is simply talking about crime alone illegal?
For the 500th time, No

Are there other subs that actually are breaking rules out there? Yes but of course there are some subreddits not known or discovered by the masses yet so the mods might not have caught up to them, *but* a good handful of them have been circulating around long enough for them to have no excuse for those few to still be up

Are there other subs like r/shoplifting, that also talk about illegal stuff yet still manage to also not break any rules that aren’t banned?   Yeah, a whooole lot of em

So then why did r/shoplifting get banned unlike the other subreddits, just like it that also discuss things that are illegal yet not rule breaking, or the subreddits that actually *are* violating rules that have yet to be banned???

Because this whole “new rule regulation” is just a nonsensical cover up for them to do what they really wanted to do which was ban the *certain* subreddits they wanted off, nothing about this ban sweep really had anything to do with rules, it’s an excuse

So then why did r/shoplifting get picked to be banned *simultaneously* along with a bunch of other subs, a lot of which also broke no rules and some of which never discussed anything illegal ever, the *same* day these “new rules” get posted in not even a 10 hour window, saying it was because of the new rules??? 

Because this whole fucking ban sweep was a premeditated inside job,

Whether or not you believe the subreddit or any subreddit for that matter should be banned is entirely subjective, that being said, if they did nothing wrong to violate any rules then they shouldn’t be banned for it, simple as that, no matter how against their perceptions you may be.

why do you keep revolving around all of which is only SUBJECTIVE.

And the outrage that it caused?, Unlike other sites with certain policies built to appeal to the norm, This is Reddit, a decentralized, user based, forum, with the freedom to make any topic of sub forums on the site, or at least it DID, there is no exact community to pertain to because the whole site is split into different sub forums, aka DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES, yeah it’s not uncommon for websites like YouTube and Instagram to have their own standards on what is allowed and not allowed like gore, cyber bullying, and hate speech, but that is because they have a specific public audience that they must pertain to, they are centralized, but when it comes to the rest of the internet, it’s not gonna be so PC, it just goes back to the classic saying you heard when you were a kid “not everyone is going to be nice on the internet” you can’t make the internet a 100% safe space, you just can’t it’s literally impossible.

Now to finish off your question either way if such a subreddit existed that some how were to be able to roam freely without under threat of mods, would probably STILL get shut down because as said, shit like that gets hell of attention from the feds to start investigating, and all it would take is a simple court order for it to get it removed by force anyways",False,False,1522904537.0,416,67,1497285394.0,False,False

On the MA firearm murder rate:

Massachusetts’ per capita gun death rate was the lowest in the nation as of January 2017. There is a phenomena in statistics called ‘regression to the mean’, which means that, for instance, someone with really tall parents will be shorter - closer to the mean (average) height - or that a state with very few firearm murders will see more in future years.

I want to push back against this. The US has the highest rate of gun deaths per capita in the first world.  That means there’s room for improvement, and preventing any unnecessary death should be a priority for everyone.

I’m just curious, do you think there is a gun violence problem in the US?

As a gun rights supporter (just my assumption), do you have any ideas to reduce gun violence in the US? 

I find that gun rights supporters constantly call out liberals for proposing ineffective solutions to gun violence, but never come to the table with their own ideas to reduce gun violence, which pisses off liberals because it makes it seem like they don’t care about the deaths that are attributed to gun access.

Just like people think Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring out of a pizza place?  Or that these mass shootings are government operations designed to enact gun laws?  It's called a crack-pot conspiracy theory and they actively cause massive damage to peoples' lives. (Actually looked this up; he had Nick Kroll on promoting a show on Netflix about puberty.  Fucking gasp.  Controversy came from a bunch of prudes trying to pretend that teenagers don't have genitalia and stating that promoting any piece of comedy or art that declares otherwise is pedophilia, regardless of context.  This somehow turned into Colbert is a pedophile.  For people who cry fake news every two seconds, you promote quite a lot of unfounded claims.)

Edit: You really don't think the ""keep your powder dry"" comment doesn't even come close to that level?  That is arguably inciting violence compared to just saying previous violence was justified (both are horribly misguided and unacceptable, but the former is arguably even worse).

Like seriously, if you actually clicked the link, scrolled down further, and read their full policy, you'd actually understand better than cherry-picking a single sentence in the entire page.

>We generally don't allow the sale of alcoholic beverages on the US eBay website (eBay.com), except for pre-approved sales of wine. At our discretion, we may permit sales of other types of alcohol by pre-approved sellers in designated categories. You can find more information about selling wine on eBay below. We don't allow the sale of collectible containers that contain alcohol. Members outside the US aren't allowed to sell alcohol to members residing in the US.

>Make sure your listing follows our guidelines. If it doesn't, it may be removed, and you may be subject to a range of other actions, including restrictions of your buying and selling privileges and suspension of your account.

>International alcohol sales
Keep in mind that the alcohol restrictions apply only to items for sale on the US eBay website (eBay.com). Alcohol may be sold on international eBay sites as permitted by local law. Please check the rules of each eBay website to find out more.

>>Generally, wine can't be sold on eBay. However, we do allow some of our members to list wine in the Wine category as long as they follow federal, state, local, and other applicable laws and regulations. These members must carry the required license to sell and ship wine, and they have completed our registration process to list wines on our website. This policy is applicable to those approved sellers and buyers who transact with them. To become a licensed seller of wine on eBay, start the registration process by uploading a copy of your alcohol license here. You also need to enter your eBay username in the comments section of the document upload page.

I mean seriously...**just click the link**. I know, it's hard, but it's **RIGHT THERE**.

Now unless Reddit is going to authorize who sells these controlled items by having them upload a valid license to them (because you can't even begin the registration process without having an alcohol license), then surely you can understand why they're forbidding it.

Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, 564 U.S. 786 (2011), is a landmark case by the Supreme Court of the United States that struck down a 2005 California law banning the sale of certain violent video games to children without parental supervision. In a 7–2 decision, the Court upheld the lower court decisions and nullified the law, ruling that video games were protected speech under the First Amendment as other forms of media.

The ruling was seen as a significant victory for the video game industry.

They need to quit pushing their paid agendas on us. Our generation needs to turn our backs on shitty business practices in every facet, punishing those who engage in them by withdrawing our presence, content, and money. The first thing you see in a business article relating to these companies is always ""X website, with approximately X unique visitors a month..."" Now, why is that??


Our time here, and on other sites, is a massive privilege for them. They go boast about these numbers and appeal to their investors. They get to research our spending habits, profile us, and leverage the info across the Internet to get what little extra money we may have. It goes on and on.


Way back when, we had unions fighting for our best interests. Why do you think every major employer heavily discourages unions???? Because they have REAL POWER! If we refrain from working for the people who oppress us, or from participating in their sites, then they can't make any money. They aren't big and faceless. We learned this before, and we starved for it. That is something they're actively trying to make us forget.  


If you invited people to come to your house and bake a beautifully decorated cake on top of a platform, had everyone pitching in, and then told them ""Yeah this is my platform and my cake, and I sold it along with every recipe you wrote for me, so fuck you and thanks for the money,"" they would get understandably pissed. 100 years ago or now, when you take advantage of the little guy, he'll eventually abandon you and your bullshit.



I'm waiting for the day we start meeting, demanding our rights and just talking and exchanging ideas in person again. Without a bunch of crazy extremism. The far left and the far right are such hypocrites, and both of them shove shit down our throats until they meet in the middle.


Where is the average Joe, representing what he believes in respectfully? Stop blocking the highways and talking about what trump is tweeting! Who can care about that agenda when we're being mentally and digitally raped, every day, for our labor and then for our free time via trash media?!


Where are the independent contractors to take on doordash and others, demanding that they pay a normal taxed wage? There's so much shit about it out there, about how 40% of jobs will be low skill, low pay independent contractor work in a few years, but nobody has been doing anything. Why hasn't anyone protested reddit headquarters? Why don't we create unions again to represent us, on and offline? Why aren't we ensuring our online selves and personal livelihoods are being protected? WHERE ARE WE? 



Please, let's go to the sources of our civil and economic distress together. We can fix healthcare, we can demand change. We did it before. Other countries have done it. Fellow millenials, baby boomers, left and right wing...... Let's just all stop getting fucked. Reddit is the tip of the iceberg, and censorship is a symptom of the HUGE systematic issues we have going on in our country right now. I can't even find a genuine post online anymore without wading through 3 pages of paid artificially inflated crap, and that tells me all I need to know about who owns my free time. 




This started as a rebuttal, but now it's a really long call to action about our general state of affairs. I guess this post is just me venting, and also a genuine outcry to everyone else who wants to see change. We don't need a platform, we need each other. We can own the cake, decorate it, and eat it too.


Find your roots together folks. Go join a union, represent yourselves, plan a respectful protest or something. Be involved. Pass out educative material, plead with each other to make the sacrifices necessary to change our world. Let's dust off the pete seeger handbook. Otherwise someone please give me a violin to play, because it feels like we're sinking.

The Court based its ruling on the provisions of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.

Yeah, but you had to specifically make your own subreddit for yourself if you wanted it. Before the redesign, your profile page was just a cumulative list of everything you posted. Now, it's got a profile picture, a banner image, a bio section, and you can post to your own wall. How is that *not* Facebook?

> We have been using imgur and videos since reddits creation

Yep, using one site to post to another. Now, you're using the integration on the site you're already on. Do you upload to Imgur when you post to Facebook?

> Discord, slack all used by subreddits already

Again, a totally different site/app, not officially affiliated with the site. When you want to message a Facebook friend, do you just Facebook Messenger? Exactly. 

> Moderators are a thing

And? Facebook can police content posted to your profile page, and now so can reddit, because, surprise surprise, people are getting walls that you can post to.

> Subreddits have been using modern themes since CSS has been editable

Yep, but it's been completely voluntary, and not every theme was a ""modern"" one. Now, reddit is making a standard, site-wide change to the theme. Sound familiar? 

> How is this Facebook?

How is that *not* Facebook? Do you seriously not know how much Facebook tracks what websites you visit? Every little ""share to Facebook"" button on a site is also a tracker, even the ones on porn sites that are much joked about. It's not that anyone would ever share a porn vid to their wall, it's that Facebook is tracking what sites you visit and for how long. Go to /r/news and /r/worldnews, just look at the shit Facebook is in right now for selling user data.

Reddit has NOT had ads disguised as posts in the feed for years. And prior to that the ""ads"" were for gold and other subreddits.

I'll give you this one, although imo that's a bit different.

> Discord, slack all used by subreddits already

Sure, but moderators aren't site wide ""media friendliness"" police. They don't care about the bottom line.

And because all this has already started roughly ten years ago, without any government taking these developments seriously, there isn't much anyone can do now.

In fact, some people think that the initial idea of the internet is long dead and what we currently have will never allow such thing, thus we need to create a ""new"" internet and abandon the current one. The question is how viable that really is and if it won't just end up the same, because corporations will try to find their way into that virtual space as well.

Personally, I don't think the internet will change anytime soon - nor will an alternative ""new"" internet solve these problems - because society lacks the incentive to create a perfect virtual space, respectively different people have different visions of what this perfect virtual space should look like.

Some might say that one of the reasons the internet ended up this way is due to capitalism and corporations - but if we take a look at other non-democratic regimes, it looks the same or even worse. 

The common denominator is lust for power/control, as well as monetary gains; the latter can be broken down roughly into ""data trading"" and ""targeted information"". The complexity of the entire construct allows for various layers to be implemented that allow to accumulate political/economic benefits without society noticing because almost everything works in the background.

This is the second issue: society not being aware of and/or ignoring the pursuit of various goals of different global players.

In the end, we actually have to change how we as a species want to treat each other, how we want to operate, what we want this world to look like. And we need to change a lot of this stuff, so in the end the main incentive to provide any product or service is not greed or profit, but higher goals that help us progress as a species.

Reddit as is, already is a much more *open* platform in various regards. That is the main reason why it is still around. User created/submitted content is a key feature, but we have this on every social media these days. What reddit offers is a more ""intimate"" and at the same time more ""structured"" view into its community - and it provides a solid framework for actual discussions.

None of the current alternatives have these features. Reading through twitter comments is a mess, finding content on facebook via search is a pain, instagram is all about visual sharing, etc. They all have their niche, facebook going for a more general approach. But what they all have in common is that - while the core idea is sharing content - it is more about feedback, respectively approval or reactions of other users (mostly within a certain social circle) in regard to your more or less personal content.

Reddit has the vote system, but this is (in theory) about a community driven filter, deciding what kind of content is relevant within a certain general topic/discussion. The core idea also is sharing, but the focus is on discussing the content provided with *a lot more users* (focus on ""not my social circle"") which allows everything from Eks Dee to a very deep philosophical discussion between various people over many days (if they so wish) - something we can only find in dedicated message boards (internet forums), which have become inconvenient because it simply is not really ""cross platform"" in the sense that people need different accounts and/or make the decision to stick to one community, thus limited to a smaller overall user base.

Before social media even existed, internet forums were really basic, but over time (not sure if this was due to phpBB coming into existence around 2000 or if it was earlier) new features were implemented like user profiles, user albums and user feeds. It was the first, more centralized approach to create actual online user profiles because before that people just posted new topics where everyone would just post their personal stuff like photos, information about yourself, etc (if you wanted to share with the community).

Social media basically is just the next step of these features, an evolution if you will. The user profile became facebook (2004, incorporating feed and album as well), the user feed became twitter (2006), the user album became instagram (2010) - and all of these became more niche solutions, yet extremely popular. Reddit was founded in 2005, news aggregation was the focus they had in mind, but the discussion aspect took off like crazy. And thus (involuntarily) reddit suddenly was the only platform that continued the classic ""internet forum style"" (without these addiational features because actual, discussible content was more relevant than just sharing personal stuff for likes), but on a global scale.  

Reddit has a solid basis for all discussion-oriented topics and will soon provide actual user profiles just like facebook with more personalized content people can subscribe to, similar to facebook, twitter and instagram. The ""new reddit"" will have the same to offer on a user profile level, but it also has the proper tools for solid discussions (something all other platforms lack massively). 

About the ""open platform"" aspect I mentioned at the very beginning: with all these changes, reddit becomes accessible to everyone and it will be super easy to navigate compared to other platforms. Everyone can already enjoy reddit without even creating an account. There are tons of lurker everywhere, enjoying all kinds of content from silly jokes to nice pics to super creative discussions - with ""new reddit"" I'm pretty sure they already have ideas how to create an incentive for people not only to register, but to create personal profiles, much like on other social media *and* convince friends to come over, simply because it is better.

People don't just want to share pics/videos or personal content and then never talk about it - quite the opposite. Take a look at comment sections on twitter, insta, fb - people want to use words, but these platforms don't have the proper tools for this because they were not developed with lengthy discussions in mind. A post like this would never happen on any of those sites, not to mention our discussion because I personally wouldn't even bother to read through the comments to find some interesting people to talk to because it is super tedious and often also very annoying.

Facebook currently gets new users every day, despite people in NA and Western EU leaving the platform because in other parts of the world, new users join - not because of the facebook community, but because of their need within their own national community. The lack of American facebook users doesn't bother them. 

Reddit's (quality) content does rely on an active user base, but with new users also comes new content and they will post what they think is good content. Also, the current reddit community won't just leave - there will be a transiation phase, probably 1-2 years after the major changes, maybe a bit longer. Within that time, new users will come, old users will go. People who stay may notice a change in content (and maybe quality), that also really depends on a lot more factors.

As for the G+ example, it is not really a good one. Google basically copied fb and tried to add their own characterstic aspects to it. And while that may have been one of many issues, it was not the main flaw. When people at Google saw fb grow, they wanted a slice of that cake - the entire concept of social media is to provide a service in exchange for user meta data, so they thought they could simply copy fb and people would use G+ instead because they did combine it with youtube and gmail. But here is what they did not consider: everyone who really wanted a youtube account already had one and everyone else didn't need one. There was no incentive to join G+ just for that. Also, everyone already had an email account - no incentive here to join. And G+ itself didn't offer anything out of the world - so overall, there was zero reason to swap and the entire design and marketing was done poorly in addition to that.

Reddit has one big advantage in this: they already have the ""main attraction"" which is discussions with people all over the world. They don't need to add anything amazing, because reddit already is (more or less) amazing. They are just adding all the tiny, less important features every other platform has and they try to make the transition as smooth as possible to make it a perfect mass product.

Maybe I'm totally wrong and people won't fall for this bs and reddit will go down a lot faster, but I doubt it. They are currently investing a lot into these changes and it feels like they have thought it through from mainstream user perspective. They really don't care that much about the core users - something that has become clear over the past two years imho. I think it is quite realistic that they can tank the loss of many core users in the future, as long as they can bait the mainstream user into creating an account and bringing all their friends with them.

And imho that is quite likely, especially if fb will get fucked more this year due to their data leaks, etc. Since insta is part of the fb family and people are not happy with recent changes either (already switching to Vero and other alternatives), that platform may not remain the #1 choice for people who want to promote their work (especially artists, photographers, videographers, etc are using insta to promote themselves and it gets more difficult every day if you are not super famous already - all these people are currently looking for new options, some of them already creating reddit profiles), though I do think it will stay relevant a bit longer than facebook itself due to the niche sharing service it offers (or is able to perform better than e.g. imgur). Youtube, idk, people are not happy and also looking for new ways, but reddit won't be their destination.

**tl;dr**: ""new reddit"" will be the next facebook imho if done properly because they will have everything facebook has, plus the very desired tools for proper text-based communications with random strangers all over the world.

A controversy surrounding the AACS cryptographic key arose in April 2007 when the Motion Picture Association of America and the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA) began issuing cease and desist letters to websites publishing a 128-bit (16-byte) number, represented in hexadecimal as 09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0 (commonly referred to as 09 F9), a cryptographic key for HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. The letters demanded the immediate removal of the key and any links to it, citing the anti-circumvention provisions of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

In response to widespread Internet postings of the key, the AACS LA issued various press statements, praising those websites that complied with their requests as acting in a ""responsible manner"", warning that ""legal and technical tools"" were adapting to the situation.

The controversy was further escalated in early May 2007, when aggregate news site Digg received a DMCA cease and desist notice and then removed numerous articles on the matter and banned users reposting the information.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (a common name for Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996) is a landmark piece of Internet legislation in the United States, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 230. Section 230(c)(1) provides immunity from liability for providers and users of an ""interactive computer service"" who publish information provided by others:



No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.



In analyzing the availability of the immunity offered by this provision, courts generally apply a three-prong test. A defendant must satisfy each of the three prongs to gain the benefit of the immunity:

The defendant must be a ""provider or user"" of an ""interactive computer service.""

The cause of action asserted by the plaintiff must treat the defendant as the ""publisher or speaker"" of the harmful information at issue.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

I state clearly that Amazon and eBay have no legal responsibility for selling items. Amazon sells knives. eBay sells both ammonium nitrate and ammonium perchlorate.

Your response was that Amazon and eBay prohibit selling Wine (they don't) ""for exactly this reason,"" this reason being legal responsibility for items they sell.

Amazon, as an actual seller, may be responsible--the only concession I'm willing to give--but Amazon, like eBay, is a marketplace that provides a storefront for third party sellers. At no point in either of their statements on prohibited items do they say it's unlawful for them to trade in these items.

They have these policies not because it's illegal, but because they generally don't want them. eBay recognizes there is market value in being able to host Wine Sellers, so they do.

In regards to my explanation of math, I have no way of knowing your level of education. Better to give extra explanation that’s not needed than to fly over someone’s head. And I don’t see how what you’ve described doesn’t fit regression to the mean. I’m sure you know what they say about correlation and causation. Additionally, though this is a weaker point (that I hesitate to add for that reason), Massachusetts’ population grew over that time period, which naturally leads to more crime (though the population growth rate was pretty low, and I hesitate to add this also because despite my pointing out that this is weaker, you’ll probably still take issue with it).


Have you heard about Australia? And how, after a mass shooting, they enacted a ban on assault weapons (yes, I know that’s not a rigidly defined term, but we both know what it means) and haven’t had a mass shooting since then?

So would things like mass shootings be possible if there were **zero** guns in the country? That’s not what I’m proposing, it’s just a thought experiment.

>	You want to reduce gun violence? Bring back asylums. You know the warehouses we stored all the crazy people away from all the pointy objects? Also make any crime that involved using a gun have the possibility of a life sentence or immediate death penalty

I agree completely. These would all do a good job of reducing gun violence. I don’t like the death penalty, but that’s a discussion for a different thread. 

But sane pro-gun rights people need to frame this as a response to the gun rights problem.

When anti gun liberals come up with non effective policy after a mass shooting, it comes from a place of emotion. The response should be: 

“Wow, mass shootings are bad, and we need to find some solutions, but here are some reasons why this specific policy is bad. Asylums and massively increased punishments for gun crimes could be more effective at reducing these incidents” and then actually follow through and implement that.

All you get for reddit political discussions are extremists from left and right, except the right extremists have ONE subreddit that MUST BE BANNED, while the left ones run rampant on every single subreddit out there. Want to unsub from those so they don't show up in your feed? Too bad, they make like 10 new ones every day with variations of Trump something in the name.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren released her 11 commandments of progressivism this week during her stop at the Netroots Nation annual conference.
The National Journal reported:

    – “We believe that Wall Street needs stronger rules and tougher enforcement, and we’re willing to fight for it.”

    – “We believe in science, and that means that we have a responsibility to protect this Earth.”

    – “We believe that the Internet shouldn’t be rigged to benefit big corporations, and that means real net neutrality.”

    – “We believe that no one should work full-time and still live in poverty, and that means raising the minimum wage.”

    – “We believe that fast-food workers deserve a livable wage, and that means that when they take to the picket line, we are proud to fight alongside them.”

    – “We believe that students are entitled to get an education without being crushed by debt.”

    – “We believe that after a lifetime of work, people are entitled to retire with dignity, and that means protecting Social Security, Medicare, and pensions.”

    – “We believe—I can’t believe I have to say this in 2014—we believe in equal pay for equal work.”

    – “We believe that equal means equal, and that’s true in marriage, it’s true in the workplace, it’s true in all of America.”

    – “We believe that immigration has made this country strong and vibrant, and that means reform.”

    – “And we believe that corporations are not people, that women have a right to their bodies. We will overturn Hobby Lobby and we will fight for it. We will fight for it!”

    And the main tenet of conservatives’ philosophy, according to Warren? “I got mine. The rest of you are on your own.”

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a list like this.
Adolf Hitler Saluting, 1934
Socialist party leader Adolf Hitler put together a similar list decades ago.

“The 25 Points of Hitler’s Nazi Party”

    1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Great Germany on the basis of the principle of self-determination of all peoples.

    2. We demand that the German people have rights equal to those of other nations; and that the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain shall be abrogated.

    3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the maintenance of our people and the settlement of our surplus population.

    4. Only those who are our fellow countrymen can become citizens. Only those who have German blood, regardless of creed, can be our countrymen. Hence no Jew can be a countryman.

    5. Those who are not citizens must live in Germany as foreigners and must be subject to the law of aliens.

    6. The right to choose the government and determine the laws of the State shall belong only to citizens. We therefore demand that no public office, of whatever nature, whether in the central government, the province, or the municipality, shall be held by anyone who is not a citizen.

    We wage war against the corrupt parliamentary administration whereby men are appointed to posts by favor of the party without regard to character and fitness.

    7. We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. If it should not be possible to feed the whole population, then aliens (non-citizens) must be expelled from the Reich.

    8. Any further immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who have entered Germany since August 2, 1914, shall be compelled to leave the Reich immediately.

    9. All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.

    10. The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.

    Therefore we demand:

    11. That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.

    12. Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.

    13. We demand the nationalization of all trusts.

    14. We demand profit-sharing in large industries.

    15. We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.

    16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.

    17. We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.

    18. We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.

    19. We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law.

    20. In order to make it possible for every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach into positions of leadership, the State must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life. The conception of the State Idea (science of citizenship) must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the State.

    21. The State has the duty to help raise the standard of national health by providing maternity welfare centers, by prohibiting juvenile labor, by increasing physical fitness through the introduction of compulsory games and gymnastics, and by the greatest possible encouragement of associations concerned with the physical education of the young.

    22. We demand the abolition of the regular army and the creation of a national (folk) army.

    23. We demand that there be a legal campaign against those who propagate deliberate political lies and disseminate them through the press. In order to make possible the creation of a German press, we demand:

Prior to Section 230 online content hosts were held liable for all manner of things even if they didn't produce the content themselves or really have anything at all to do with it.  

Section 230 shored things up in completely the other opposite direction where online content hosts were basically not liable for anything on their sites, regardless of what type of content it was.  The courts misinterpreted the law as also preventing federal investigation and prosecution of crimes, when really it was intended to prevent frivolous civil lawsuits and to restrict states from creating a patchwork of laws on something as worldwide as the Internet.

So not we're swinging back in the other direction where online content hosts can be held liable again, and not only federally, but also at the state and civil court level.  

The Congress could have just clarified the law and said something to the effect of ""nothing in Section 230 shall preclude federal investigation or prosecution of criminal activity on the internet""  and everything would be balanced in the middle ground.

Which makes admits that in the context of selling then it is facilitation. 

You can’t define something for a seller but undefine it for a buyer. It’s either a definition or not a definition. 

Which you have absolutely no way of proving that the ones providing the links are not sellers. Or there are NO sellers in the subreddit. 

You are not being objective. 

The fact remains that the promotion of a sale makes it easier to sell the product. 

Facilitation is not exclusive of any of the other terms and definitions you provided. 

A solicitation, advertisement, promotion or announcement can make a sale easier to occur. 

I provided a source that shows this. 

I don’t know how many other sources you need. 

How about this one? 

http://www.pondiuni.edu.in/storage/dde/downloads/markiv_asp.pdf

>”Promotion may be defined as “the co-ordination of all seller initiated efforts to set up channels of information and persuasion to facilitate the scale of a good or service.”

Do you need more?

http://kalyan-city.blogspot.com/2010/07/5-ms-of-advertising-advertising.htm

> “Advertising facilitates large-scale marketing. It is a medium of mass communication. Manufacturers supply information about new products through it. The fact that companies spend millions of dollars on it through TV, radio, the internet, and newspapers indicate its benefits in sales promotion.”

The fact is it doesn’t matter if there wasn’t a single seller on the subreddit. Facilitation is facilitation no matter the direct it moves. Internal to external or external to internal. 

How about a fucking thesaurus.

I do not know, Maybe me also stating and citing 

>Murder rate bottom'ed out in 97 at 1.9 and rose to 2.8 in 2011

Would also say that the Firearm Murder increasing was not due to population increase if the rate went up ~50%.

>Have you heard about Australia? And how, after a mass shooting, they enacted a ban on assault weapons (yes, I know that’s not a rigidly defined term, but we both know what it means) and haven’t had a mass shooting since then?

Yes, anyone that has done research would know that the massacre death rate for Australia per 100k was .5 prior to the ban. And after the Ban per 100k was .5. As you can clearly see this was a ridiculous improvement that excuses all the negative effects of the policy. /s 

This is basic statistical analysis that anyone can do. But, evil me, I didn't include mass murder ONLY by guns, I was including all massacres.

Anyone that can lookup the basic stats on Australia, might as well be saying, well we had no measurable impact on gun violence according to the research (or we can ignore the academic research on this too), and we should ignore that after the ban there was a spike in murder, armed and unarmed robbery, assault, rape and sexual assault, and kidnapping because eventually this went down so therefore the gun bans had only massive improving effects.

Right-wing terrorism is terrorism motivated by a variety of ideologies and beliefs, including Islamophobia, anti-communism, neo-fascism and neo-Nazism, and a mindset against abortion. This type of terrorism has been sporadic, with little or no international cooperation. Modern radical right-wing terrorism first appeared in Western Europe in the 1970s and it first appeared in Eastern Europe following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Right-wing terrorists aim to overthrow governments and replace them with nationalist or fascist-oriented regimes.

> “Promotion is most often intended to be a supporting component to the marketing mix” or, in other words, promotion is a tool to market something. or, in other words, promotion is a tool to market something. Not as a platform to facilitate a transaction.

From there, they can go to wherever they need to and facilitate a transaction, but they are not using the promotion itself as a marketplace to exchange goods or services. The promotion is strictly a tool for advertising.

Promotion is advertising. They are synonyms. And advertising facilitates sales. By the very act of bringing awareness.

Yes or no? 

You won’t answer this question. I am willing to wager.

He was shot and killed by Orlando Police Department (OPD) officers after a three-hour standoff. Pulse was hosting a ""Latin Night"" and thus most of the victims were Latinos. It is the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in U.S. history, and the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the September 11 attacks in 2001.

— u/reddit 2012

We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

Because capitalism and leftism are not either/or. There's such thing as a regulated market. There's such things as economic policies and social policies.

Communists *say* they want the working class to be armed and equipped to revolt against the bourgeoisie but as soon as the revolution is over there is always and consistently a move to limit the concentration of power to a relative few in the government and away from the underclass the government claims to represent. The whole reason horrendous, dictatorial communist policies work is because the body politic do not have the means to violently resist horrendous, dictatorial communist policies.

Liberals prize individual rights. Gun ownership is a liberal policy. Self defense against tyrannical government is a liberal policy.

Dick's sporting goods store didn't stop selling guns, they stopped selling those controversial scary guns.

REI stopped selling Camelback and other brands because the parent company also owns a company that owns a firearms manufacturer.  The lengths that businesses are going to in order to virtue signal their correctness at the expense of people and organizations who have done nothing wrong is fucking astonishing.

I have no problem with Reddit banning private sale subs, and understand the legal issues with letting people trade alcohol and tobacco.

Firstly, don't do the line by line quoting thing. It's the crutch of the weak argument. I don't know why progun people and racists do it so much, but...stop. It makes it nearly impossible to have an adult conversation. 

Similarly, stop saying ""virtue signal."" It makes you look like a fucking idiot. Dicks didn't stop selling those guns to ""virtue signal,"" they made a business decision. They'd rather lose the business of some tiny percentage of their total sales in favor of preventing one of their stores being used as the purchase point for the tools of a mass killing. That would really hurt business. Much more than losing a tiny amount of gun sales.

You're the very people that say bad guys will figure out how to get guns even if you make them illegal. If I wasn't legally allowed to buy a gun, an illegal private sale would be my option.

This is what their press release says.  The actual cause is pressure from gun control advocacy groups.  If Dick's *actually* was concerned about not being part of future tragedy, they would stop selling guns altogether, a decision I would support.

Prior to 2015, I supported same sex marriage.  I considered it a civil right, though it wasn't (yet) recognized as one.  I supported it even though I'm not a homosexual.  In some places, it was illegal for same-sex couples to marry.

If at the time Reddit had banned any sub that advocated for gay rights or for same-sex marriage, would you have considered that a problem?  Would you have protested it?  I would have.


Yes, Reddit is a private company and can do as they please, but we also have a right to voice our grievances.  In my opinion, we have a *responsibility* to protest injustice - which this is and which my hypothetical would have been.  And we should protest those decisions even when it's not our group.  Because it's a human or civil right.

One of the other subs that was banned today was r/gundeals - a sub where people posted advertisements for 3rd party websites having a sale on gun-related items (e.g. scopes, carry cases, ammunition, etc.).  There is no possibility of illegal activity in what is frankly a coupon sub.  It was banned because of a recent push among tech sites to purge Wrong Think.

You do not understand the bulk of the paper. But, because you saw keywords that were relative to the subject you are trying to argue (confirmation bias) you then posted the article as proof of your assertions.

The paper is not in anyway proof of your original assertion. That the definition of facilitate is subjective just because quantifying how easy something is in relation to individuals is subjective.

I said u had no problem with Reddit banning the private sale subs.  I said that the only reason to ban a sub, that operates like numerous other subs on Reddit that only post links to sales of firearms or accessories that are only sold by valid FFL holders (just to be clear there are federal requirements to become a FFL) which complies with every law in the US is because Reddit is targeting guns.  Period.  You are the person who brought up laws in other countries about why they might have banned gundeals and I pointed out there are numerous other laws in those other countries that regulate free speech that Reddit ignores.  Again, that is them targeting only firearms because they are politically against them.  Same as what YouTube has just done. 

If Reddit had come out and just said that is why they banned the subs then I would have at least understood it.  But instead they blatantly lied saying that linking to sales on goods were not allowed unless it was advertisers and then they ignored other threads that do just that.  Then they said it was because they couldn't ensure the legality of the deals, but the deals, unlike the alcohol and tobacco trades, were not being made on Reddit.  These were not private deals between two people, but instead links to stores that were offering deals.  All transactions are being done through the retail stores, not Reddit.

I'm not arguing that all subs effected by this policy change are inherently bad. I'm not saying they all partake in illegal activities. From what I see is Reddit taking action against possibly dangerous and harmful subs by using a blanket method of banning any sub that helps facilitate the sale and tranfering of said goods.

You're still not pointing out other laws that Reddit freely dismiss. If a country has laws against freedom of speech, Reddit isn't resposible for enforcing that. They don't dictate where their members come from and what they choose to share in active posts. That's not the same as banning the sale or soliciting of various goods. One Reddit has control and can effectively take action against, the other they can not.

We're coming around to a complete circle here. This is where you popped in. I asked for specific evidence to prove that Reddits new policy is politically motivated; something I have yet to get. Never once have you provided a legitimate source that states Reddits dislike for guns, nor do you provide any detail on their stance for or against guns. Simply saying they are politically motivated simply because they do not allow the sale and soliciting of guns isn't the same as being against them. Closing a sub that now doesn't meet policy isn't proof of that case. If, for example, Reddit said there are no more subs that talk about guns at all, then I'd be inclined to believe you, but since topics about guns are still allowed, I find that hard to believe.

Everything you post is circumstantial at best.

I get it, you don't like the change. You think it shouldn't exist as a policy. Don't mistaken what I'm saying in that I think the policy is inherently good, I just don't see what the big deal is. Most people are twisting this into something more extravagant. This is not oppression of free speech like some people claim. Does it counter past remarks that Reddit was going to allow any and all topics to ve discuessed? Sure, but things change. As a private business they can change as they see if. If this is something that people don't like, by all means move to a other place that caters better to their audience.

So yes, a sub that provides safes and scopes can still be banned, maybe not because they sell scopes but because someone provided information for selling or buying firearms in a post.

The major reason these rules were put into place (as far as I've read) was to restrict the passing of personal information for trades and sales of regulated items (regulated is the keyword here.) That's why you see a ban on beer and guns but not used underwear. Used underwear isn't regulated. Yes, some subs offered legitimate ways to purchase firearms, I'm well aware of it, but on Reddits part, it's fair easier to actively ban any form of trade for these items as oppose to seeking out which subs are doing it legit and which don't. A zero tolerance mentality, so to speak.

Honestly, the best point for your argument, which you didn't even state, is that a sub was banned because people exchanged empty shells. They basically traded scrap metal of bullet casings and were banned for it. That is something I find to be ridiculous. ",False,False,False,59107,513,1466864972.0,False,False
