It hasn't even been five months since the worldwide PIPA & SOPA protests and Congress is back to playing its standard game of slashing and burning what we hold most important for the sake of their personal agendas. The bills of PIPA & SOPA are effectively dead, but their text is being broken up into pieces and has been put into other bills and what they represent lives on. I do not want to alarm you, the person reading thing, but you should starring long and hard at what is going on right now. We are on the precipice of something horrible happening and if we do not fight again, we will lose horribly and our personal freedoms will be maimed and impacted far beyond what we can see as the initial impact:

As of today this is where we stand:

1. SOPA (The Stop Online Piracy Act) is effectively dead

2. PIPA (The PROTECT IP Act) is effectively dead

Currently there are four bills in Congress that stand to wipe away the privacy, the anonymity, and the freedom we take advantage of every day. If any one of these bills makes it through Congress the internet as we know it is effectively over. This is a zero sum situation and we have to act again.

As it stands now, days after the House of Representatives passed CISPA, we are poised with the questions of: Who, what, where, and why? While many of the answers to those questions can be found in the links posted above the biggest reason as to why major companies like Google, Facebook, and even reddit have not spoken out vehemently against these bills is simple. They actually stand to benefit from them in some ways. CISPA was crafted from the ground up, with the help of some of these very major tech companies and the NSA, so the debacle of SOPA & PIPA wouldn't happen again. Instead of having to fight against companies and their users they now just have to worry about your average joe getting upset. Doing this paints a much smaller target on the bill and makes it that much more challenging for us to prevent the abuses that are poised to come from CISPA and the additional 'cybersecurity' bills. 

Many are calling for blackouts again but unfortunately Congress is trying a new and incredibly effective strategy this time. They are dividing us from the companies that assisted us last time. In the language of CISPA it has been found, cut and dry, that most companies will be given immunity from what goes on within their enterprises so long as they hand over your information en mass. This means that your user profile, your personal information, your comment history, the websites you link to, and even possibly what you like of Facebook and similar websites will be handed over to the government. To make matters even worse, the government will essentially bribe these companies by paying them to hand over the data. Congress did something cunningly smart, they made it so the only allies the common user has are themselves. Reddit INC as a company has no good reason to speak up loudly in support like they did with PIPA & SOPA. The reason is that they actually come to benefit from CISPA.

/r/ExplainItLikeImFive puts it nicely:

>[Basically it allows companies to provide the federal government with data concerning ""cybersecurity threats"" without liability. Currently most large websites have a Privacy Policy which normally states that companies will not voluntarily share your data. If they did share your data, then you could likely successfully sue them. CISPA protects companies from lawsuits if they share data concerning ""cybersecurity threats"" with the federal government. So companies like Facebook and Google tend to like the bill because it shields them from liability.](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sujsu/what_is_cispa/)

We must not, we cannot, allow these companies to ever believe that that selling out the user and throwing them under the bus can be part of their business model. It must be a concrete, inseparable, fact that our interests are the companies interest. You and I stood up and fought in the ways that we could to protect these companies like Google, Facebook, even Reddit INC from PIPA & SOPA. They need to do their damnedest to do the same for us. The ridiculously overused saying by pastor Martin Niemöller best fits here:

>First they came for the communists,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.

>Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.

>Then they came for the Jews,
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.

>Then they came for me
and there was no one left to speak out for me.

A. They keep coming with the same attacks, just written differently every time, we must do the same. The blackout brings a gigantic black open enrollment form for all of the internet who has no idea regarding CISPA or related bills (very effective). Although I will agree they lose their effectiveness over time, this method is still and has been in the past an amazing attribute that we have created within.

B. We need to gather as a community outside of these wires and circuits. We need to hit the streets, Remember that retarded KONY 2012 Thing? DO you realize how effective that was?! We need to revamp the idea and start a creation of our own, vimeo videos, a day to repeal, meetings and hit the fucking streets. 

C. News, Who are reddits allies? Websites, Talk Show Hosts? The Huff Post or Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert, NO matter what it is, we need to either have the admins contact them and work something out or we need to continue to multiply emails to these people and have them work with us, This costs us nothing but our time, the time we are choosing how to live it. Lets not stop.

D. Can we form Donations? Billboards, commercials, whatever we have to do to gain exposure.

E.[/r/fia](/r/fia) Free Internet Activism - Everyone should at the minimum glance this page.

F. Admins/Someone Important/Potato_in_my_anus Please create an askreddit topic to figure out where and how we should start first and make this hit the front page, If I were to create it I feel as if It would not get proper exposure, we are the most powerful internet group out their, let us know how we can agree to come together.

The community as a whole is framing this argument wrong. CISPA is simultaneously undermining your right to control information about yourself while increasing corporations and governments ability to control information about their operations.

The concepts of intellectual property and privacy are entangled and by being re-active instead of pro-active, we're sacrificing liberty so that corporations thrive.

The primary purpose behind the design and implementation of the internet was to increase the efficiency of scientific research and development. It is built around the value of collaboration; allowing individuals access to facts and theories so that they can advance the rate of human creativity.

We should be writing legislation demanding more transparency of the corporations who are utilizing a government project to increase their profits instead of focusing on hitting back when they try to undermine our liberties.

Human beings have a right to privacy. Corporations have no such right. Intellectual property rights choke off creativity and productivity for the sake of constricting the number of people who profit from an idea. Yes, creators deserve to be rewarded fro the production of ""content""... but hiding the scientific principles surrounding a new technology or burying studies that call into question the value of a product are both slowing the rate of human advancement.

I'm not saying to stop defending the right to control your personal information, but we need to create a threat to the power-base of the people attacking us, or its just going to keep happening over and over.

Then I remembered an argument made by a fellow countrymen regarding e-tolling in my province*. If it works there (the USA) it will start to appear closer to home, wherever you live. Bad ideas should be stopped before they are spread by bad people.

*In South Africa's most economic active province, Gauteng, the government decided to upgrade the intercity, and urban highways (the province is about 100km x 100km in size) This is a good thing, but later on with terrible communication to the public they decided to errect drive through toll gantries. To the public the documents and information were either censored or jumbled. But the information it did give was that the average worker will pay a lot more to get to work. The cost of of living would also increase significantly, harming the poor. The tolling system would be extremely innefecient, at about 50% admin cost, but it also came to light that a lot of backers and investors in the system will coin it big time. So a cheaper alternitive to cover the cost of infrastructure upgrade would be to increase the fuel levy. People in other provinces and cities said this is unfair since they would have to pay. The argument against this was two-fold. First if the system is succesfull it would start popping up in other urban centres within a couple of years.

The government then does their bidding, which generally has negative impacts on both the people and the planet (not just the American people, mind you). The government uses the police and the armed forces to enforce the rules they put in place at the demand of the corporations. And the bulk of the money used to pay for the whole show comes from taxes. 

Taxes are paid by the public, to the government, who spend that money to bully the public into submission. 

Privatised prisons, corrupt police departments, illegal wars, forcing religion into schools, allowing companies to go unpunished for environmental destruction and endangering the world's food supplies... the list goes on. 

Spying on the public is just another step towards controlling the population they feed off.

Unfortunately, there is no quick and simple answer to this problem. There is no overnight fix. But President Obama is the closest thing you have to a leader you can trust. Show him that you respect him for the things he has done, are disappointed and feeling let-down for the things he has done wrong (in your opinion), and that you still have hope for the future. 

I think the best way to do this is through an online guide or similar that outlines all the bills and policies in a TLDR format, with the reasons and repercussions for each. 

Market the hell out of it not just in social media on the web, but in a leaflet drop where everyone able to prints out a dozen fliers a day, begging people to go and get a rough idea of what parties or candidates they can trust, and which ones are shady as fuck, (or outright crooks).

Then give them a poll to vote on how they feel about each party or candidate. Don't tell them the poll results until the end, so they can see (based on their choices) which party or candidates left them feeling the most confident and which ones feel like slimy crooks. 

It has to be fair. You can't just say ""Reddit feels this way so this is the right way""- it has to be the voice of the people. ALL the people, or as many as you can reach. 

On the same site, you could list the candidates for each position with a snopes style (crossed with wikipedia style) breakdown of the broken promises, lies told by or about each one, colour coded, with a graph or pie chart showing each group or party's history in regards to racking up debt, starting wars, telling lies to the public, breaking laws, corruption, etc etc etc... 

Make it simple enough that a casual browser can skim it and get a rough idea of which member or party is the most dirty, the best for the economy, the most reliable, the most war-hungry, has the most ties to corporations, and uses the most underhanded tactics.

In the case of CISPA, the major social sites (Facebook, Google, etc) ALREADY collect the data that is asked for in CISPA and ALREADY share, sell and store that data.  Social media sites make the bulk of their money selling user data to anyone who is willing to pay for it.  If these companies were to come out against CISPA, their very business model could asked to be aired in public, and that is the last thing they want.  Did anyone see the expose about the data Facebook is willing to handover on the flimsiest of contexts?  It's chilling to say the least.

Remember, these are companies that hold not only your name, but address, emails, credit card information, buying patterns, what websites you visit, what you read, what you click and countless other data points.  This is information that even those sites who gather it will not share with you, but will release to advertisers.  The giant revenue of companies such as Facebook and Google is based on trading and selling your personal information.

Now, ask yourself, do you think these companies would block a law which makes the sharing of this information easier?

As for Reddit, SOPA threatened their very existence.  Reddit is a site a where people could share pics and info from other sites, therefore could have fallen afoul of the restrictions in SOPA, and could have possibly forced Reddit to shutdown.  But now, with CISPA, which doesn't target companies and websites, but individuals, Reddit has no stake to lose.  That is why there is no big announcement that Reddits execs will go on the warpath.  CISPA does not affect their business plan like SOPA did, so why risk there necks by making themselves a target?

What it comes down to is that web ""giants"" will fight anything that directly affects their business model, revenue stream and very existence tooth and nail.  But when it comes to something that would solely affect their users, they could care less as long as they can exploit it to make some more money.  Take a look at the penalties or fines that major tech companies have paid for privacy transgessions and compare that to the profits they made.  Do you really think that these companies will fight to protect the very same people that they are exploiting as long as it doesn't affect their bottom line?

That's why the powers be at Reddit have been so quiet.  They have nothing to gain and nothing to lose vis a vis CISPA.  So why should they put their corporate neck on the line for something which does not affect their bottom line and something that will not harm their business model should the act pass?  Because it does not affect them, therefore they don't care.  No business will pick a fight if they are not threatened, and Reddit is no different.

Which is a shame.  If Reddit lead as zealously in this fight as they did against SOPA, it could make a difference.  Instead they opted for a tepid statement and a half hearted call to action.",False,False,False,29774,207608,1334599740.0,False,False

SOPA and PIPA were a danger to personal internet freedom AND the integrity of companies like Microsoft, Google, and reddit.  Reddit's participation in the blackout was laudable, and whatever effect it had on the movement ultimately yielded a result that was good for both the website and its users.  However, we should not pretend that the reddit admins stepped in just because the users wanted them to -- they stepped in because the issue threatened the very existence of the site itself.  See, for example, the removal of subs like jailbait.

With CISPA, reddit the company has not become a major player in the opposition because it no longer has an equal interest in the outcome.  I am actually fine with that; reddit is a huge website run by a small number of people, and it takes a lot of effort to engineer something like the last blackout.  Moreover, the number of people who actively contribute to reddit is much smaller than the number who come here simply to consume its content, and not all users are affected by American political developments.  I do not expect the role of the admins to include using the site as a soapbox for popular opinion of the users, even if the issue is something quite righteous and worth fighting for.  The users themselves do that, through the submission and discussion of content.  If the admins choose to take up an issue and run with it, then good for them -- but I do not expect them to do so unless it affects the existence of the site, even if it's an issue that many redditors feel strongly about.

**TLDR:**  It is reasonable to expect reddit to expend resources fighting for something that affects its existence.  It is not reasonable to demand reddit do the same for something that affects some of its users.

**1. Don't write to your congresscritter**

Put down that pen! Close that word processing program!
Forget all that happy crap you learned in civics class about
sharing your views with your ""representative."" You don't
have a representative any more. You merely have someone
who thinks he or she is your ""leader,"" unfettered by either
your opinions or the Constitution.
Your congresscritter assumes the role of the overseer in the
field. You are merely the ""n-word"" toiling under super-vision.
The benevolent massa wants sincerely to ""help"" you, as long
as you toil and obey.
Marx was wrong: religion isn't the opiate of the masses; in
modern America, the drug that keeps us numb, dumb and
well-behaved is a belief that we can still make a difference by
politely voicing our views to our would-be rulers and owners.
The fact is, every minute you spend writing to your congressperson
is a minute you don't spend on useful freedom
activity. Every minute you spend writing to your congressperson
is a minute you fool yourself into believing you're
accomplishing something when you're not.
101 Things To Do 'Til The Revolution
2
What happens to your letter
Here's what happens when you write your congresscritter.
Your letter is carried into his or her office in a big plastic
crate along with thousands of other letters. An aide scans it to
see what it's about and sticks a form letter in the mail to you.
Then the aide enters your name in the computer, with a
notation that you wrote to say, ""Vote yes on X"" or ""Vote no
on Y.""
If you're lucky, they might actually get the topic right. If
you're really lucky, they'll record you as being on the side of
the issue you're actually on. They're just as likely to record
you as being one of your own political enemies, though.
Doesn't that make you feel special?
Even if you get what appears to be a ""customized"" reply, it
was written by an aide and probably signed by a machine. The
congressperson never saw either your letter or his or her own
reply.
If you send an e-mail, an automated system scans your
message and zaps back a reply, without your message having
been seen by human eyes.
The whole process is designed to say, 'There, there now,
little citizen, your congressperson cares"" — when, in fact,
nobody cares.
If you're rich, famous, powerful or influential (or if they
think you're a dangerous loony, but that's not an impression
you want to make), you have a chance of being heard by
someone in Congress. Otherwise, the only time you have the
slightest chance of influencing a congressperson's views is
when your letter — or fax or phone call — is one of several
thousand expressing the same opinion. Then it's only going to
help if: 1) the congressperson is already on your side of the
issue and wants to wave a basketful of supporting letters
during a floor debate; or, 2) the congressperson's seat is
Chapter One and Only
3
insecure and he or she has to do what the people want for a
change, or else.
The only method that might do a bit of good
If you just can't live without writing to your congressperson,
keep a stack of pre-addressed postcards handy, and
when you're so roused up about something you simply have
to do it, write, ""Vote no on HJ32000, the Counterterrorism
Act sponsored by Rep. Bigbro,"" or ""Vote yes on SB504, the
Privacy Amendment sponsored by Sen. Rarebird.""
Bright-colored postcards get more notice, just as shiny
objects best attract the attention of mindless rats.
Keep it that simple. Don't waste your time on reasoned
argument or constitutional issues. Use those arguments
elsewhere, with people who might actually listen.
In order to become the master, the politician poses as
the servant.

They don't consider our situation to be 'their fight' even when it really should be. They figure that we're their users regardless and don't care. If there is consequence for them then they will be more inclined to say something.*

Facebook, reddit, Google, you need to get back in the ring. We stood with you and I don't mean to sound pushy but its your moral obligation to stand with us. If you are not willing to fight on our behalf then we will be left with only two options. We can either sit here and let you sell us out because its convenient or we can demonize you for the actions you choose to support and revile you until we are capable of creating something that will leave you obsolete. You may believe that you are too big and too influential for some random person talking on the internet to do much harm to your enterprises, but make no mistake that if you do not make it your imperative to fight for us in the open and behind the scenes then we will be left with the only option of creating, through necessity, something that takes you out of the equation. 

Out of all of these bills I have yet to see the focus of attention be on the biggest problems we face. Those problems boil down to government employees, contractors, and users with access to sensitive networks misbehaving and not doing what they should. No government employee should be downloading torrents, watching porn, blogging, or any of the sort on government computers. This leaves them vulnerable. Outdated software, and insecure networks, when coupled with connecting infected cell phones or USB sticks to these systems compromises them to such a level that nearly every company or aspect of government has been compromised on some level. Here are just few articles out of hundreds that highlight the plague of incompetence that could so easily be stopped by proper training and setting essential standards within government agencies, private contractors, and the US military. Almost all of these things do not require new laws but instead require internal changes that effect management and policy within these entities.

**Changes in Current Cybersecurity Law are Needed:**

The fact of the matter is that current cybersecurity laws are lacking. While a vast majority of problems could be prevented by reasonable, common sense, approaches and policies within agencies, it still stands that the current law is lacking in certain regards. However, the blanket approaches that are used in all of these bills and that are all too common cannot be used as they are so far reaching and apply to nearly every aspect of the internet. SOPA & PIPA drew so much ire due to the easily broad interpretations that could be made under their legislation. Similarly, CISPA and the additional bills, follow this line of thinking. Rather than just throwing everything under the sun under a single umbrella Congress needs to be much more choosy about where they allow for broad interpretations within their legislation. Loopholes and blanket approaches cannot stand and we need to make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. Using ""protecting children"" as part of the actual language of the bill to include topics covered by CISPA is outrageous. 


**I hope many of you are asking how you can help:**

 If you want spend a few minutes you can retweet, discuss and link to articles on facebook, talk to your friends and family, upvote these kinds of topics on reddit. Subscribe to /r/evolutionreddit, /r/fia, or any of the various subreddits that these subreddits link to. If you want to be informed, then doing the little things will make all the difference. The little things add up and your effort could be the piece of straw that breaks the camel's back.

If you are a doodler you can create a work that symbolizes what is wrong with these bills and please release it under one of the appropriate licenses. If you are a video editor, or even have a webcam, you can make a work and upload it to youtube or any of the various other video websites so others can watch and become better informed. If you you are a writer or a journalist, and it doesn't matter what your level of expertise is, you can help explain to others why these bills are to atrocious. If you are on a school paper you can write an article and bring the fight to your campus. 

If you have an email, if you have a phone, if you have five minutes to kill, you can call or write someone and give them a piece of your mind. 

All that matters is that you try to do your part. Give up an afternoon and print out fliers to pass out around town, to stick under windshields, to staple to a local bulletin board. If we do not advocate for ourselves them nobody else will.

reddit INC we need your help. During PIPA & SOPA you blacked out your website. I fully understand that it must have cost you quite a pretty penny and there is a chance that your corporate owners may not allow you to do the same again. However, sitting here and just speaking a blurb does not cut it. You have the resources to reach out to the community and explain to the uninformed just how sweeping and damaging CISPA will be on your users. You have the means at your disposal to dissect CISPA and make it accessible to every John, Mary, and Sue. You are capable of motivating hundreds of thousands of people to speak up and create a ripple so large that the rest of the internet will be forced to take notice. We are not asking you shut down every time some there is a jarring bill that wishes to take away what we hold dear, we are asking you to stand with us on the front lines and to keep standing there with us so we do not have to fight alone. Give us a blog post that rivals ['A Technicaly Examination of SOPA & PROTECT IP](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html).

If the “only way we win is when we stop electing people who step on our rights” then lets vote those people out of office.  All it takes for something like this to start is by having an idea, ‘Vote to be represented, Not punished’. (I’m not that good at catchy phrases so it is open to refinement, but you get the idea.)  Spread this idea around like so many other things are and everyone will realize that the current congressmen are doing more harm than good, and we can elect the proper candidates to be in those offices.  Seriously, if people who read this could find ways to tell people to not vote for the current congressmen in office then this idea will start to take effect.  
I was also questioning myself about the effectiveness of the petition the other day too.  I’ve been amazed this year with the success have gotten.  So much so that it raised a question for me to ask; could it be possible to have laws revoked by petition?  Honestly, if there was a petition that was spread around to remove the NDAA Act, which allows for the detainment of Americans indefinitely without trial, I would sign it along with everyone else I know.  Does anyone know if it is possible to get something like this to going?

It probably has something to do with how biased the community is, and how very few facts and constructive discussions have taken place.

Take, for example, [this hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3896492) thread about CISPA passing the House. You will see that the top comment is not pandering to a preconceived opinion, but rather playing devil's advocate (at the very least).

On reddit, any thread about CISPA only has comments against CISPA -- many of them vague and not supported by any facts or legal analysis. Anything challenging the hivemind is ruthlessly downvoted, and no constructive discussion takes place.

It was slightly less worse with SOPA because we had people like Kirby Ferguson explaining the problems and more importantly, being honest with you guys. You are now not being honest with yourselves and you are letting blind hatred guide your decision making. This is incredibly irresponsible.

I laughed reading a thread in /r/bestof where practically everyone is BLAMING Reddit, Inc. for not taking huge strides this time, when there's barely any solid opinion about the bill from the community. Most of the activity is centralized in /r/technology and /r/politics.

I see this going two ways: either a more honest opinion will unfold where the reddit community can actually constructively form opposition to privacy-attacking legislation, or this cesspool will stir out of control and blame the administrators for not doing enough to coerce the community into a position on the issue.

It is also important to note that websites like Reddit and Wikipedia are in a position where they must be responsible and not try to shape public opinion or be biased. The only reason they agreed to blackouts was because SOPA passing would actually damage those websites severely. Without that interest, they have a responsibility to be neutral on most issues.

it allows for shutting down accounts and sites if there is believed to be a threat not just to the infrastructure of the internet or national security, but to the financial interests of big media companies. as far as CISPA is concerned, intellectual property theft–otherwise known as piracy–represents a threat to cybersecurity. with that in mind, the sharing of personal information is not the issue.

I've read the bill. It's not SOPA II at all. It's very much targeting an actual problem: in the event of a widespread cyber-security threat (like a massive DOS attack on multiple websites), corporations are not currently able to share threat information in the ways that they need to. That's a legitimate issue.

The real problem with the bill is that the over-broad language might potentially allow it to be abused. But even that's less of an issue than you might think.

> if you trust your Internet provider, e-mail provider, and so on, to protect your privacy, CISPA should not be a worrisome bill. The U.S. government can't force companies to open their databases and networks; federal agencies can only request it. - [CNET](http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57422693-281/how-cispa-would-affect-you-faq/)

Think critically about this for a moment. If you know that the companies you contract with are reliable, CISPA is not a bill you should be worried about. To an extent this is good news; many businesses like Google have a strong history of [trying to protect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_International_Inc._v._YouTube,_Inc.#District_Court_proceedings) user privacy.

If, on the other hand, you don't trust someone, e.g. Facebook, with your data, let's think about what that entails.

First of all, if you are giving information you wish to protect to a company  you don't trust, ""you're gonna have a bad time."" Who on earth would give sensitive data to Facebook? The only thing this bill changes is that they can now share it, under certain prescribed circumstances, to certain prescribed entities to be used for cyber-security purposes. You *really* thought your data was private before? At least now you know otherwise.

If you have something worth actually protecting, you should have it encrypted, with a key only you have. Anything less is illusory security, which is worth nothing at all.

Are there real issues with CISPA? Yes, of course.

Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity.  I appreciate hearing from you.
 
We must be vigilant in protecting the privacy rights of Americans.  As a United States Senator, my primary responsibilities are to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people.  
 
At the present time, we know our public and private networks are alarmingly vulnerable to intrusion.  This is undermining both our national security and our economic competiveness.  We need to do more to secure out networks, and there isn’t any reason this should be a partisan or ideological issue.  
 
We should work together to pass cybersecurity legislation that safeguards our critical infrastructure, permits more timely sharing of information with stakeholders, and recruits the next generation of talented cyber personnel.  Any approach on cybersecurity must also include meaningful provisions that prevent the sharing of sensitive personal information with other government agencies or private sector entities.  The end goal of cybersecurity should be to make the personal data of online users more secure.
 
As you may know, there are a number of different legislative proposals on cybersecurity currently before Congress.  I am evaluating all of the different bills, and I will keep your thoughts in mind as opportunities to address cybersecurity come before the full Senate.
 
I value the input of fellow Coloradans in considering the wide variety of important issues and legislative initiatives that come before the Senate.  I hope you will continue to inform me of your thoughts and concerns.
 
For more information about my priorities as a U.S. Senator, I invite you to visit my website at http://bennet.senate.gov/.  Again, thank you for contacting me.

Second: you're drinking too much Ron Paul Kool-aid. He's just another republican politician who hides his anti-science views (such as global warming being a scam lol). He hides behind having to take any real position on any real topic by claiming to want to let individual states take care of it. He also wants to go back to the gold standard. There isn't enough gold in the world to go to a gold standard. 

But I have very little faith in American politics. Especially considering the track record. 

Interesting thing to wonder about: how does Ron Paul plan to override a corrosive congress and a sold-out senate in order to get his magical plans to go forward?

Simple. He can't and he knows it. Everyone with a pair of braincells who hasn't gulped from his Jesus-juice Understands it. He's using both parties to get what he wants: to just be called president and continue the same cycle the Bush family began. RP isn't dumb, and he's got a great marketing campaign going for him. He just requires the stupid and the stoned. By joining the republicans, he got the stupid. By avoiding to take a position on weed, he got the stoners vote. 

American politics are (and for Most of the last 20 years, have been) a huge joke. There is a joke from a comedian that is often quoted. I'll paraphrase badly: ""I like the puppet on the left, but the puppet on the right aligns with my views. Oh wait, they are both controlled by the same guy!""

I highly doubt he was unaware of what was going on at the time. Unless his wife was dying in hospital, it just seems too coincidental to me.

2. Absolutely not. The drug war is archaic and counter-productive. But the drug war preceded Obama and it will outlast him. Entire agencies exist to fight the war on drugs. It's definitely not something Obama can actually remove without congressional support. But I also don't think that Obama would end the war on drugs even if he DID have congressional support.

Well doing something such as making a short incursion into Libya without ground troops (I believe that was the idea) was something that Obama technically wasn't allowed to do. Same thing with nabbing Osama from Pakistan.

Government spying again, precedes him and will outlast him. America is built upon a huge spy network (embassies, CIA, NSA, etc). Those agencies simply will not go away. And I hope they don't, personally, as long as they are still pointed externally. But maybe I read too many old Tom Clancy novels. 

I believe the president has power to make small decisions that normally take a very long time to be debated and approved/denied in congress. For example Libya and Pakistan. How many weeks would it have taken for congress to approve picking up Osama? What would have been the odds for him to have remained there? 

The president, outside of snap decisions, is basically our last chance for a veto vote against the incredibly stupid amount of bills attempting to be passed.

The problem is that Ron Paul knows that. His campaign is based on things that are slow decisions and require long term implementation (such as destroying the fed, gold standard, and every other idea he has). We simply don't know how he will act when it comes to the quick decisions that actually make a president.

Lastly, I still think Obama the most left of any presidential candidate, currently. He implemented medicare.....no other president in the history of America has done this. And he did it in a recession. With a republican dominated congress. If I could vote, I'd give him another term. And then Hillary twice.",False,False,False,3610,1524,1277329443.0,False,False

I used to be into really insane heavy metal (like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4ui9q7eDM), the first 20 seconds will make the point), then I got a bit more artsy and sophisticated and got into progressive stuff, like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4ui9q7eDM). While that still stays with me, it's expanded a lot since, into classic rock ([cream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkae0-TgrRU), [led zep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlNhD0oS5pk&ob=av2n), [deep purple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfAWReBmxEs), you know the drill), modern art/psychedelic rock ([muse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sclt7c5DUe4), [my morning jacket](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZCQV2dcSTE), [linkin park](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bftTUAIVMUQ), [wolfmother](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O63P9Ecujc)), and psychedelic rock ([the koolaid electric company](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjhcwfE5Idc), [the doors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKbPUzhWeeI), of course, [pink floyd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTeXkHfWYVo), [the blue angel lounge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY4r4C3BrV0))

You may want to reread my comments. This sentence tells me you didn't understand what I was saying. 

*You* said voting wasn't enough. And I never disagreed. I just pointed out how most people have been conditioned to think that it is. That's what distinguishes a democratic system from any other after all; protesting/campaigning in all their various other forms are just as effective under any other governmental system which allows them, so if voting doesn't matter why bother with the pretense of democracy? 

No, you're confronting most people with a reality that undermines a huge portion of what we've been taught about our country, and calling them whiney at the same time. The fact remains that staying informed about issues and voting at every opportunity are all that the average citizen needs to do to make a democratic republic that *will* function well- ""should"" doesn't enter into it. 

What you're doing here is going on to a website frequented by folks who tend to be more knowledgeable than average about any given political issue, and telling them that they have to pick up the slack for the rest of the country. And that they're lazy or apathetic for not doing so. 

Personally, I'm doing everything expected of me as a citizen by staying informed and voting. If you want to take your ""with us or against us"" attitude and apply it to my valuation of freedom because of that, go right ahead, but it won't win you many allies.

>Yes- vote with [the information]. That's the active part.

You may want to reread your comments.  Also, I've never said voting doesn't matter.  It most definitely does matter.  What I'm saying is that sometimes, simply voting - informed or otherwise - may not be enough.  Sometimes, protesting isn't enough.  Sometimes, you have to take direct action if you feel strongly enough about your cause.  Sometimes, you have to be the change you want to see in the world.  (sorry for the cliche)  If the problem is corrupt politicians, then be one that isn't.  Or find one that isn't, and get them elected.  Raise awareness, work on a campaign, lead a campaign, be in an election.  Whatever level you choose to help at, just help. There is more you can do - more you have a responsibility to do - if you believe the government is out of control.  

I honestly don't care what most people have been taught. Just because they have been taught wrong information doesn't make it not wrong.  And if the truth about our system (that it calls upon every citizen to be personally responsible for their government) undermines what they've been taught, then maybe what they've been taught needs undermining.  And if being informed and voting at every opportunity is all it takes to keep government from becoming corrupt and ignoring the will of the people, then the problem is still our (the population as a whole) fault because the vast majority of people *do not do this.*

I understand most people here are better informed than John Q. Public.  And I'm sorry if other people dropping the ball means you and I have to pick it up.  That sucks.  But if not you, then who?  Sure, you ""should"" be able to just be an informed voter.  But since the reality of the situation is that just being an informed voter isn't enough, just sitting back and letting the ""bad guys"" take over means you have a level of apathy/cynicism/laziness/whatever-the-hell-it-is towards the process that prevents you from giving enough of a shit to work harder, do more.  

It's not a ""with us or against us"" attitude.  It's a ""you don't like it? then do something about it!"" attitude.  I'm not even discussing a position anymore.  It's not about taking any *particular* position.  It's about taking *a position*, and following through.  If all you want to do is be an informed voter, then fine, do that.  Just don't be surprised when it isn't enough.  (Sometimes it is.)

It's actually perfectly appropriate, since that's exactly what I (for instance) am doing- keeping informed of relevant issues, voting accordingly, and generally conducting myself in a benevolent manner. This is the change I want to see in the world. I don't want to see people driven by a passion for a very abstract concept like freedom, even if it means they do good occasionally- those people tend to be easy to manipulate.

Well, you seem motivated. Part of my point is that *your* effort, personally, would be much more productively allocated by going out and informing people/campaigning etc. than chastizing those of us who'd rather not.

Alternatively, if enough people come to actually *believe* the quoted sentiment instead of dismissing it as originating in apathy, it's entirely possible that the idea of increasing the power of the vote relative to other forms of political influence could come to receive much more attention and support. The cry of ""nothing will ever change"" has been enough to spark change before.

Point being, if you want to motivate people to actually do something in a situation like this, general advice like ""get involved in local politics"" and ""stop being apathetic"" isn't the best approach.

Advice: apply a machine learning classifier to separate herp-derp from actual substantial posts. Then give us the curated feed. You could call this feature ""-herpderp"" and would work by adding ""-herpderp"" to the URL of any subreddit. Ideally, it would curate the comments too, not just the subreddit feed.

I could do it myself but I don't want to implement a feature off-site.

This web site has had revenue generation problems from day one and they still haven't figured it out.

Your point was that, rather than unsubscribing from /r/all, you should browse it and bitch about it: 

> Doesn't help when browsing /r/all.

Simple solution: don't browse /r/all. There's one foolproof way to avoid content you don't want to see: *don't browse the part of the website where that content is.*

> It shows what reddit is into at a greater scale than my own personal interests.

If you're willingly venturing on to /r/all, then don't bitch when you see /r/atheism comments. 

>Bitching about what people are bitching about does about as much good as bitching about how other people want to use a website. So how is this not a case of the pot calling the kettle black?

I unsubscribe from subreddits I don't want to view *so I don't have to bitch/circlejerk about how bad they are.* I'm not bitching, I'm explaining to you in not-so-nice terms *how to easily avoid content that you don't want to see.* It's easy when you're not an idiot about it.

That wasn't my point. My point was *if* you chose to browse /r/all, then it wouldn't help. Which is what I posted.

> Simple solution: don't browse /r/all. There's one foolproof way to avoid content you don't want to see: don't browse the part of the website where that content is.

But what if I want to browse /r/all? And since when am I one of the people bitching about the content? I just pointed out that the earlier solution doesn't work when browsing /r/all. That's it; nothing more, nothing less.

> If you're willingly venturing on to /r/all, then don't bitch when you see /r/atheism comments. 

I don't.

> I unsubscribe from subreddits I don't want to view so I don't have to bitch/circlejerk about how bad they are. I'm not bitching, I'm explaining to you in not-so-nice terms how to easily avoid content that you don't want to see. It's easy when you're not an idiot about it. 

Except you are preaching to the choir; I already know not to bitch about these kinds of things. Explaining in not-so-nice terms can be considered a form of bitching. (Or, more actually, it is *being* bitchy.)

> It's like saying
 
>> Oh man, I hate Domino's Pizza, but I'm going to keep ordering it to my house because it shows what pizza people are into at a greater scale than my own personal interests.

A more appropriate analogy would be:

* I don't like how all meat pizzas are so greasy.
* Then order veggie.

Sure, it is a solution. But it doesn't help when what you want is a meat pizza.

> Fuck other people's interests. Order whatever pizza you want. 

Fuck other people's reading habits; read whatever you want.

Fuck other people's complaints; bitch about whatever you want.

Or, in other words, I think we actually agree on the core principles here. As I said, I was just trying to point out that unsubbing does not help the content displayed on /r/all -- which is obviously obvious.

EDIT: Story time kids. Once upon a time as the legend goes there was a guy named Redditnoir who was a novelty account *juuust* like Shitty but not quite. You see, Noir went around replying to comments with a part of a story... would've been a great story had he completed it... Noir always wrote as though he was a detective looking for someone in the dirty cold city named Reddit some say it was /u/karmanut, other say it was /u/potato_in_my_anus, other thought he was just chasing his tail. Noir ventured through the red light districts full of those pretty /r/gonewild girls with the neck beards staring greedily and throwing upvotes hoping for more. Unfortunately, Noir mashed too many toes... pushed is nose in too many dark corners... on his search... and Shitty was sent after him to silence him **at all cost.**

It wasn't till that faithful day, while following his clues, [Shitty found him](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s62r2/every_single_time_i_open_my_oven_i_dont_wait_long/c4beubx?context=4) and blindsided him with more paintings than he could write stories to. The dark side of the hive mind seeing defeat started mailing threats to Noir, who knew things would never die down... did the bravest thing a man could ever do. He loaded his gun, pointed the barrel to the underside of his chin... and pulled the trigger. Me myself? I don't think he did it, I think he was man enough to click that deactivate button and is now free, free to explore that mysterious place that's mentioned in /r/outside.

The overlords of Reddit more specifically that slime bag,  mainly /u/yishan, they rewarded /u/Shitty_Watercolour handsomely with votes, karma and reddit gold. Last I heard, he has lifetime access to that fancy place named /r/lounge. [obligartory link](http://www.reddit.com/r/yishansucks)

So that, /u/koenm, /u/AukeXI, /u/EARink0, /u/elborracho420, /u/noteberry, /u/zaccos and /u/frere_de_la_cote, that is the reason why ever time I see /u/Shitty_Watercolour **I downvote that bastard, but he never notices with all the protection he gets anyway.**",False,False,1369180999.0,19689,3166,1311715008.0,False,False

I am, however, worried about the technical competence of Reddit for taking Heartbleed seriously, but otherwise using SSL in very nearly the least correct way possible.

Dear Reddit: If you want us to care about our account security, you should at least give us an option for SSL to begin with. SSL-at-login-only is a great way to expose all your users, all the time, to session hijacking. Because of the way Reddit works (customized homepage and all), I suspect most Reddit users stay logged in, which means we're carrying around session cookies for a *long* time with *long* expiry times.

A password theft would be more dangerous, except that by default, Reddit's login/signup page is delivered over plaintext also. Even if the password is theoretically submitted over SSL, a MITM on the login form could steal passwords, even before Heartbleed.

I went to update my password, as a result of this announcement.

When I left my (verified) email address in the password/email form, it did not update my password in your system (it said ""email updated"", even though I didn't update my email address) even though I filled in my old password and put my new password in both of the password/verify-password boxes.  I had to clear my email address for it to do so.  (it then said ""email and password updated"")

Then, when I put in my previously-verified email address, it required a new verification.  Furthermore, it didn't automatically attempt to verify the address I put in place (this may or may not be by design, but I view it as an unhealthy design).  Unlike every other web service I have used, this one also required a queue-processing time before it sent the email so that I could verify it.

I recognize that you view your service primarily as a means of wasting time, but even if you do view it such, I'd rather waste time browsing your site and not by getting anxious over administrivia (such as ""making sure that my password storage and your website believe I have the same password"", or ""having to reverify an email address that I already verified because your password-change form doesn't act properly when the new-password/verify-password fields are filled in"").

I use IBM Notes and IBM Domino, which were first released (as Lotus Notes and Lotus Notes Server) in 1989.  And even *they* have more effective and consistent password-change semantics than Reddit, which was first made available in 2006.  17 years, for a large step backwards in usability and security.

How many people have tried to change their passwords, and failed, because they have a verified email address?

Please fix this.  My account has had its password changed, because I'm anal-retentive about ensuring that my records and site records match.  I've noticed, however, that most others are not so paranoid.

Also, when you had your certs revoked, did you generate new keypairs?  Since it was the private key which was subject to disclosure, simply recertifying the same public keys wouldn't protect you or your users.

This is because dictionary crackers work based on a word list which is a very large text file containing 1000's of words and common names. It can also test for letters replaced with numbers and punctuation as well as number like birth year on the end of the password, and if you know what you are doing you can set it to test most likely to least likely passwords. 

All in all, the most effective password is the 4 random words from a dictionary with an important number and punctuation. 

Ex. I like pi. 3.14159! 

Thus password is very hard to break to th the point where anybody willing to cracked it would be extremely disappointed to know all that hard work went to claiming a reddit account with 12link karma,  357 comment karma and a bunch of posts in /r/adviceanimals and /r/askreddit

Assuming an average person knows 25000 words, which seems generous, and that an average person will string together 4 words or less for a password for length limitations, using the same example as XKCD

4 words, out 25k = 25^4 = 3.90625e+17 combinations
11 characters out of 70 = 70^11 = 1.9773267e+20 combinations

Please login to reddit using this URL: https://ssl.reddit.com/login
Do not use the splash screen that is generally presented as this does not have the full protection of SSL/TLS and may expose your account credentials.

Everyone who uses a web browser should make sure that SSL/TLS certificate revocation is enabled on all browsers and leave these settings enabled for at least 3 years since that is the window in which we are all vulnerable to revoked certificates being used against us fraudulently. In all respective browsers look for certificate revocation or any mention of the use of the OCSP protocol. To check if your browser is warning of certificate revocation correctly Steve Gibson (of GRC Security Now! fame) has a nice little site that explains the risks to those that are vulnerable, check it out here: https://revoked.grc.com/ (if you can't see the site due to a browser warning you are protected!)

For the Reddit staff; in your SSL/TLS server please demote ALL RC4 cipher suites as RC4 is now generally the most distrusted cipher due to the Edward Snowden leaks, this is something that Bruce Schneier is recommending. Promote all GCM cipher suites as these are powerful, efficient and robust. Remove support for secure client initiated renegotiation as this mitigates the risk of Denile Of Service Attacks. Consider over the next 12-18 months switching off support for SSLV3  as use of this protocol diminishes due to the death of Windows XP (all modern browsers now support TLS1.0).",False,False,False,181,1,1301787137.0,False,False

**XKCD is really great, but please do not rely solely on the method suggested in [comic 936](http://xkcd.com/936/)—especially for important account—because it's insecure.**  


Unfortunately, [stringing together multiple words to make a long password](http://xkcd.com/936/) is already obsolete, thus ineffective and poor security.  This is because one of the ways passwords are cracked is by dictionary attacks, which reduces the cracking work from guessing multiple letters, to guessing multiple words.

8 random lower-case or numeric characters

36^8 = 2,821,109,907,456 possible passwords

4 Common words strung together (with a 200 word vocabulary) would be:

200^4 = 1,600,000,000 possible passwords

This should illustrate the disaster potential for using common words in my opinion.

The average user before has been shown in studies to use incredibly common as fuck words for passwords. Adding more words just really adds a tiny amount of entropy.

If we swapped the standard to using common words, very efficient dictionaries would be developed to crack these passwords.

Let's say we whittle down that list of 200 words to the top 50 most commonly used words in passwords.

50^4 = 6,250,000 passwords/guesses

Even with this, there's a good chance someone could get lucky and crack a password.

Let's say a study is done and they find that the most vulnerable accounts often use a total of only 10 common words like; sex, football, penis, fun, god, dicks, vagoo, dildo, poop, and ass.

10^4 = 10,000 passwords/guesses

I think this illustrates my point that common words are not necessarily the way to go, the most secure password is simply randomly generated letters and numbers.

As far as common words with random substitutions go it's harder to calculate, but the more random your password characters are the less likely a dictionary attack will pick up on that.

He does this by explaining them as a series of choices you must make to pick one password from the set of all *possible* passwords that you could make with that algorithm.  The bigger the pool of possible passwords that an algorithm can generate, the more secure those passwords are.  This is important because password cracking programs try to model these exact algorithms and iterate through that set of possible passwords.  A good algorithm will have the biggest pool possible and generate it from the most memorable choices.



The first password looks complex because it involves six choices (caps or not?  which base word?  Which substitutions to make?), but it has a problem.  Not only are the choices hard to remember, but they tend to have very few possible states.  For instance, caps-or-not can only be one of two things in your password, so your bang-for-buck ratio in terms of how large your pool grows per thing you have to remember is ""double"", which is not so good.  Choosing four common words, despite being fewer decisions, is picking four times from a pretty big set of possibilities.  The number of way you could do this explodes exponentially.


Incidentally, one bit is a good way to represent a choice between two things (1 or 0), and that's what Munroe does in the comic.  The total pool size comes from multiplying the all the component choice sizes together.  Incidentally, it's easy to do this in binary as well.  The possible number of outcomes between two independent binary choices is 4: [00, 01, 10, 11], which is exactly two bits.  This is the same as making one decision among four equally probable possibilities.  You can keep adding bits this way to represent picking something out of larger and larger pools, and that's how Munroe represents the total number of possible passwords: he guesses or determines the number of possibilities for each little decision you have to make, represents them in bits, then adds the number of bits together.  The total number of possible passwords is then equal to the number of unique integers you could make with that number of bits.   Every new bit doubles the pool.  ""Correct Horse Battery Staple"" comes from a pool of many more bits than ""Tr0ub4dor&3"", but is easier to remember.  



Relating how many possible passwords there could be to how many characters are in the password starts to touch on the concept of ""entropy"", which is a deeper pool.  Consider this: A one-character password is not strong, because it is one symbol from perhaps 255 possibilities.  However, the grid-based password system on mobile phones where you have to draw a line that connects some of the grid's dots is much stronger even though there is still only one symbol that you provide, and that's because you are picking a single thing from a much larger pool.

5915,35zmy,cgsj7ah,t1_cgshv5w,t3_231hl7,1397518207.0,7,"I can help with this, I actually just had to explain this to a layman yesterday.

The basic gist is that when a computer does a brute force attack, it's going through a range of digits and guessing every possible combination of characters within the set (like a-z A-Z 0-9 specials and so on) with that number of digits.  So if you have 4 digits, you're guessing every possible combination of characters within 4 digits.  You can't re-use any of that when you move up to 5 digits, so you're guessing every possible combination of those characters within 5 digits now.  This increase is exponential, so when you get up to like 16+ the number of combinations to guess gets ridiculous, even for a computer.  

The time becomes expanded greatly when the character set to guess is larger, too.  When a password is being cracked the fact that a number or special character or whatnot is there is enough to increase the complexity of a character set (how does anyone know WHICH letter of the alphabet will be capitalized?  If you don't, you have to include all of them).  This means even having *one* capital letter, *one* number, and *one* special character increases the character set by *all* of those things, which is a huge jump.  So that, combined with length, gets a really ridiculously secure password going.  Something like this would be an amazing password cryptographically:  

Ilovehavingreallysecurepasswords1!

34 characters long and forces the cracker to use upper and lower alphanumerics, all numbers, special characters, and so on.  It would require some time to crack in hundreds of years and it's absolutely brainlessly easy for a human to remember.  correcthorsebatterystaple is good for its length (which is the point he's trying to make), but you can still improve on it by enlarging the character set.

The whole gist of rainbow tables is that you're pre-generating these values and sticking them in a text file.. since generating that data is the hard part.  The actual comparison of the data is the easy/quick part.  But still.. rainbow tables that contain that large of a pre-generated character set would take an enormous amount of disk space.  I'd have to guess at least 4-8TB, I'm ballparking it though.  Tiny for a datacenter, pretty big for a power user, and definitely huge for your average user.

Don't forget the way that these cracks work is that the password is guessed (generated) and then it's hashed with whatever encryption type is being used.. then compared to the hash you already have.  

A quick example, with a certain encryption type (I'll use MD5):

**aaaaa** becomes **594f803b380a41396ed63dca39503542**

**Ilovehavingreallysecurepasswords1!** becomes **2959c171eac7cba9bfdddb1763c70a1b**

Always and forever.  So if your password is aaaaa, your hash will be that.  So when a cracker's brute force generates ""aaaaa"" they'll see that hash, see it matches yours, and then realize your password must be ""aaaaa""  The complexity of the password doesn't actually change the complexity of the hash, as you can see -- this is done to obfuscate the password length (among other things) so people can't say ""oh, the hash is X long, so I only need to bother guessing X or fewer characters.""

Mostly word/letter order doesn't matter, some cracking algorithms will use plaintext wordlists and variations on it, so they may actually string together random words in order to make guesses and throw things like one number or special character at the end because crackers know full well that people like to do this.. but it's still severely offset by the fact that it's just so damn long.  Think of how many english words are in the dictionary.  Think about four *random* words.. the number of possible combinations to guess is mind-boggling and one individual computer can't really make quick work of it either.",False,False,False,11172,654,1213018173.0,False,True
5916,3zw3l,cgsm0yv,t1_cgshv5w,t3_231hl7,1397524224.0,2,"Passwords are usually acquired by one of x ways:

1) Phishing attacks (you're sent an email to a fake login page that records your password)

2) Crappy sites/services getting hacked (your password is used on forumX which has security holes)

3) Spyware infection on your machine listening to what you type/send

4) Brute forcing (usually impractical, but some services can have vulnerabilities making this possible)

With 1 and 3 they'll usually have your name and password. So you're screwed.

If they manage to gain access to the user data of a site/service with #2 they'll usually have your name and copy of your password in an **encrypted** form (Unless they're complete idiots and store the passwords as normal text. Then you're screwed again.).

When you have an encrypted password, working out what the password actually is is a little tricky.

You see encryption normally only works 1 way: You encrypt *""iloveponies""* and out the other end you get *""f53388acbbf84e54bd7d105f...""*. But once you have *f53388acbbf8...* there's no way of turning it back (or there shouldn't be). So when you go to log in normally you give it your password, it gets encrypted, and if that *encrypted* version matches the encrypted version they have on record then *great*, they know you've used the same password. But the service itself doesn't actually need to know what your original password was.

So once you've pilfered an encrypted password, the usual method for working out what it came from is to encrypt every combination you can think of, until one of them matches. Computers are fast. They can do this given sufficient *time* (usually a long time).

-

So we've got a big list of 20k encrypted passwords, and we want to crack as many in as short a time as possible. Lets start with obvious guesses first..

(note that if they you got you via number 4 you'll end up here too.. since they'll need to try every combination while they're trying to brute. Although usually with much limited capabilities)

First we'll try a few hundred commonly used words/passwords. That's just a few hundred to try, that's good and fast, even for 20k passwords. 

Then we'll try each of those same words, with the numbers 0-9 on the end. There's just a few thousand combinations to try now. That's still okay.

Now we'll try again with the first letter as uppercase - a few thousand again.

...And eventually we'll end up trying every combination of upper, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. There's scadoodlezillions to try, but we'll leave it going for a while, trying the shorter passwords first, then slowly getting longer until we finally give up or decide we have enough.

So obviously to get the most passwords we want to try things that are more common. The more likely your password is to be similar to other peoples (in form and length) the more likely it is to be found out earlier. If you password really is a *random* scramble then that's good, that's possibly relatively unique in form. If it just starts with an uppercase letter, and is then mostly lowercase, with a few letters capitalised or replaced with common letter/symbol substitutes and then ends in 1 or 2 numbers/symbols (as exampled in xkcd) then no, this is more likely. Attackers are more likely to try combinations like that before they try completely *random* combinations of everything. They'll work their way out from predictable patterns, to less likely.

xkcd's example of using long memorable phrases is that

A) It is rememberable

2) It is long

Passwords aren't usually long phrases of words. So this isn't a pattern they are *likely* to try. This *likely* won't be found until they're trying every random combination last of all. And because it's very long they won't get there till the very end.

And really our hopes are all based on the fact they'll give up before they get there. Getting this far is likely to take a *very* long time, even with some real meaty computing power.

Of course if everyone starts doing it now and it becomes *common* then it's likely attackers will start trying *random list of 3-5 words with and without spaces* before the other stuff, so it will become less secure again.

There are also limits as to how many combinations you need to try. Encrypted passwords are only *so* long (depending on the scheme used). So after a while long passwords start coming out the same as shorter ones. The speed at which they can guess also depends on whether the usernames/passwords came with **salts**, and whether they all use the same salt. If they use the same salt then you can encrypt one guess password, then loop through and compare it to every encrypted one for a match. If they all use different salts then you'll have to encrypt your guess separately, with the salt, for every single one, taking much, much longer. And there are other factors based on scheme, and tricks you can use - I've skimmed over a lot and massively simplified.

But the trick is to be uncommon. Your password should be far, far from the norm - both in content, but also in the *form* it takes. 7 characters may be a little short, even if it does feature letters, numbers and special characters in a *random* form. Really though every password is insecure if the attacker already has a user/password list and enough time/machine-power behind them to crack it. Every password will eventually be found out. So make it long, uncommon, and use a different password wherever possible, so when one is found out it does not jeopardise others.",False,False,False,27680,450,1271112341.0,False,True

xkdc assumes that a potential attacker does not know your password, but your password scheme. In your case:

> 7 random scrambled letters (upper + lower), 2 special characters and 3 numbers

Then, the question is: how many passwords that match the scheme do exist? I have no idea why they used ""bits"" for that number, let's just do the calculation for ""correcthorsebatterystaple"", or 4 random words. They assumed that you choose the random words from a pool of 2048 common words (""11 bits"", because 2 ^ 11 = 2048), so there are 2048 * 2048 * 2048 * 2048 possible passwords, or 2 ^ 44, or around 17 trillion. Meaning: an attacker has to try (max) 17 trillion passwords to get the right one.

You can calculate ***your*** password strength, too. Assuming you use the letters / chars / numers in exaclty that order:

- each random upper/lowercase letter = 52 possibilities, so 52 ^ 7 = 1 trillion combinations
- 2 special chars: there are not too many that are commonly used, so let's say 10 per char, so 10 ^ 2 = 100 combinations
- 3 numbers is easy, 10 ^ 3 = 1000 combinations

So your password scheme is really good, 10000 trillion combinations fo find your password (max).

xkdcs first password is unsafe because the basis is an ""uncommon"" word (one of 65000 unkommon words), and as an attacker will have a database with uncommon words the length of the word is not relevant.

With 46 possible characters and a 7 character long password, there are 4.358x10^11 combinations. With 20, there are 1.800x10^33 combinations. That means a 20 character long password has 4.159x10^21 times more combinations than the former, which is not even comparable since it's so large.

Now in terms of character efficiency  'Tr0ub4dor&3' is harder to crack than any word combo of plain characters the  same length but ""correcthorsebatterystaple"" is harder to guess because just like mutating troubador with caps, numbers and symbols adding a new word to the end is also a mutation.

You want those notes to be totally private, so you and your friend come up with a secret code that only the two of you know. Every note you pass is written in code, and even if your teacher grabbed every single one of them, he wouldn't be able to figure out what they said. That's a very ELI5 version of encryption.

But now let's imagine that every time your friend opens that note in class, your teacher can see a tiny chunk of it - maybe only a few letters or numbers. And let's say that because your code is so complicated, your friend has another piece of paper on his desk (called the ""key"") that he can reference to actually translate from the coded note to plain text. Now, your friend is really stealthy, so he does his absolute best to hide the ""key"" under his desk so that nobody but him can see it.

Heartbleed is the equivalent of your teacher having super vision that allows him to see tiny bits of both the notes you pass AND the piece of paper that tells your friend how to translate the message - **even though your friend is doing his best to hide everything**. Your teacher can only catch the tiniest glimpse of those things, but after enough time, he can piece together big chunks of your notes but also (perhaps) the entire ""key"" that your friend uses to translate your messages. 

If your teacher writes down everything he sees - both messages and the ""key"" - for long enough, he can eventually crack the code and read every single note that you have ever passed to your friend using that ""key"". It's important to note that your teacher would REALLY have to put a lot of effort into this in the ""real world"" of the internet, because you and your friend would be among **billions** of pairs of kids in class passing notes. But it's still possible, because your teacher has lots of eyes.

If you know the encryption key, you could reverse it, so you'll know that ""09agjq349f8yevj4328v"" is supposed to be ""Hello there!""

Encryption allows you to enter things like your credit card and address and password into websites without other people knowing what you typed. The website will have their encryption key, so they will know what was entered, but other people won't.

OpenSSL is the name of one such encryption program. It's used all over the internet on many, many websites, reddit included.

[It was recently discovered](http://heartbleed.com/) that there was a bug in OpenSSL that allowed people who are not supposed to get private data to get it. These people are referred to as hackers (or, if you want to be pedantic, crackers).

OpenSSL has been fixed. People that own websites which use the broken version of OpenSSL need to use the new, fixed version. Then they need to revoke their old encryption keys and use new ones. Using old ones would allow crackers who got encryption keys before OpenSSL was fixed to keep taking information which isn't theirs.

The reddit admins are saying that they have done both, updated OpenSSL and revoked the old certificates/encryption keys, and as such it is now advisable to change your passwords in case someone nefarious got ahold of them while OpenSSL was broken. If you do not own a website, you still need to make sure you're not using the broken version of OpenSSL, as information can be taken from you if you do. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/22h163/critical_crypto_bug_in_openssl_opens_twothirds_of/cgmzrln) explains what to do to fix the problem.

That makes no sense, exploits do not really work however you think......They are not like viruses running on your computer.

However, there is some truth the fact that some clients may still be vulnerable (like Android 4.1.1).  If you were on Android 4.1.1 and sending your password over https on coffee shop wifi, someone could exploit you (someone also on the coffee shop wifi).

This situation is a lot more specific and harder to exploit as your https clients are not accepting connections actively (unlike servers who talk to whoever talks to them,  your phone only decides when to talk and to who).

A public vote where everyone knows isn't democratic.

Otherwise, everyone should have the option between a nym/alias/fake name on reddit and using their real name.

Though most people use someone they are a fan of instead as a fake name.  Now that's original.

> Reports that NSA or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong. The Federal government was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL until it was made public in a private sector cybersecurity report. The Federal government relies on OpenSSL to protect the privacy of users of government websites and other online services. This Administration takes seriously its responsibility to help maintain an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet. If the Federal government, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerability prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community responsible for OpenSSL.

> When Federal agencies discover a new vulnerability in commercial and open source software – a so-called “Zero day” vulnerability because the developers of the vulnerable software have had zero days to fix it –  it is in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability rather than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose.

> In response to the recommendations of the President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the White House has reviewed its policies in this area and reinvigorated an interagency process for deciding when to share vulnerabilities.  This process is called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process.

People are needing to change their passwords because of this recent threat and this allows them to create new unique VERY strong passwords (as well as usernames) without needing to actually remember them.

Furthermore, if an account is hacked, it isolates the issue to just that ONE site.  Sure it won't stop the server from getting hacked in the first place, but you sure as hell don't want the rest of your accounts getting infiltrated as a result.  Since most people use the same username and password for all their accounts, it means that every account becomes vulnerable.

Also for people who do in fact create unique passwords but need to remember them, they need to rely on patterns or tricks to remember them and thus they'll often be based on words and utilize little to no other characters, thus making them easier to hack.  

How about I demonstrate a couple generated passwords from keepass:

- UasEsKns6R\&6E;OhV1w4b7M5
- H@~rKIRV!ngRbbaRISuO7W:+z
- =:D|\fRyuXq.JkRwFR%HoZS:i

It also lets you randomly generate passwords for each site, and warns you if you've re-used the same password across multiple sites.

If you're not happy with letting someone else store your login details, you can also use [KeePass](http://keepass.info/), which stores your details encrypted on your local machine; there are various browser extensions available for that too, though I've not set it up myself. Some people also store their encrypted KeePass database on services like Dropbox in order to synchronise them between machines.

Either way, given the number of website breaches that occur, and the number of accounts people have, reusing passwords is a really bad idea, since if one site gets hacked, all the sites you used the same password on are also at risk.

When someone forgot their password, we would reset it to the word ""password"" and tell them to log on and use that, and then change the password to anything they wanted to after logging on.

The problem was that nobody changed their password after logging in. We had too many users that used ""password"" as their actual password.

Even then people complained that ""password"" was too hard to memorize. So we used ""passme"" instead, but then they still didn't change their password so we had a lot of users using ""passme"" as their password.

Some of the employees became trolls and tried to guess passwords to administrator accounts using ""password"" and ""passme"" and they got in and started to mess things up.

Our fearless network administrator changed settings to force a stricter password that required at least 8 characters and an upper case and symbol to qualify and made all passwords invalid so that after logging on they had to change them. People got angry, they couldn't follow the new security policy for the new password so they couldn't log in and kept calling the help desk asking for help.

Finally the security policy on passwords got changed back to normal. We tried other passwords like ""late4work"" and ""changethis"" but it only made people confused and so we went back to ""passme"" instead.

http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4704/how-does-changing-your-password-every-90-days-increase-security

If you're password is too weak, however, the only thing stopping it from being cracked is time. A long enough password should hold that off for long enough that it doesn't matter (after all, if a password takes 1000 years to brute force, then it doesn't really matter how often you change it).

And of course, you don't want to reuse passwords because if the programmer didn't hash the passwords, then changing your password every x days probably won't do anything.

For example with, mixed letters, numbers and symbols (size 96 character set), a size 16 password has 5.204e+31 different combinations. I'm not sure what the fastest computers are doing these days. I grabbed the [first Google result I saw](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-cracks-every-standard-windows-password-in-6-hours/), which mentions 350 billion per second (3.5e+11). That makes for a total of 1.486e+20 seconds, or 4.708e+12 years.

>__Internet Relay Chat__ (__IRC__) is a system that facilitates transfer of messages in the form of text. The chat process works on a client/server model of networking. IRC clients are computer programs that a user can install on their system. These clients are able to communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients.  It is mainly designed for [group communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many) in discussion forums, called *channels*,  but also allows [one-to-one communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_(communication\)) via [private message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging)  as well as [chat and data transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Client-to-Client),  including [file sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing).

no, it's really not all that important.

I disagree with /r/technology mods' stance on banning certain keywords, but the accusation that it's because they're ""bought"" is actually hilarious to me - to the degree of being laugh out loud funny.

I moderate a default and a couple of other quite large subs.  We don't make money for deleting content and we're never even approached from anyone about it. The most I've ever been approached for is ""can we be the official X of your subreddit?"" and we've never been offered *money* for it, the people ignorant enough to think we'd say yes to that are also too ignorant to even attempt to make it worth our while!

I've only been offered compensation once for prominent placement on a subreddit. I've politely said no, that's not right / ethical / fair to reddit (the website OR community).

I've never once been approached about compensation for deleting other content, and I've never seen a shred of evidence that a single moderator elsewhere has, either.

Much more likely scenario: the mods of [insert any sub here] are grumpy about seeing [insert topic here] too often and/or have decided it doesn't add to the subreddit, so they've banned that content.

>In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a __vampire number__ (or __true vampire number__) is a [composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number) [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) *v*, with an even number of [digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit) *n*, that can be factored into two [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers) *x* and *y* each with *n*/2 digits and not both with trailing zeroes, where *v* contains precisely all the digits from *x* and from *y*, in any order, counting multiplicity. *x* and *y* are called the __fangs__.

>For example: 1260 is a vampire number, with 21 and 60 as fangs, since 21 × 60 = 1260. However, 126000 (which can be expressed as 21 × 6000 or 210 × 600) is not, as 21 and 6000 do not have the correct length, and both 210 and 600 have trailing zeroes. Similarly, 1023 (which can be expressed as 31 × 33) is not, as although 1023 contains all the digits of 31 and 33, the list of digits of the factors does not coincide with the list of digits of the original number.

>Vampire numbers first appeared in a 1994 post by [Clifford A. Pickover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_A._Pickover) to the [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) group sci.math, and the article he later wrote was published in chapter 30 of his book *Keys to Infinity*.

LastPass touts pretty strong encryption and multiple levels of it so if you believe them they're quite secure. To my knowledge there's no way of them proving that they have such encryption without compromising it or having been backed.

I'm in the online marketing/web analytics world and my understanding is that once a given device is initially associated with a userID, it maintains that association unless you push a new userID to it (such as when a new user logs in).  So if you simply log out, it has enough of a device footprint to continue associating your behavior with the profile you previously logged in as.

Would really appreciate a technical answer on this one, ideally backed-up by Universal Analytics official documentation.

I assume Reddit has thought about simply requiring a paid subscription to generate revenue -- something like $1 per year ala WhatsApp -- in lieu of going the traditional paid advertising model.

But, under either model, the Redditor pays. Either way with dollars, or we pay with privacy data. I see that the privacy policy indicates (at least in its current iteration) that no user-identifiable data will be sold to third-parties, though (1) some might wish to foreclose even aggregated, geo-specific data from being disclosed, and (2) the nature of the TOS is simply to change when the economic desires of the company changes. I have no doubt that, one day in the future, Reddit will sell user-identifiable data. I think that's a fair assumption unless and until Reddit includes a contractual clause in its TOS prohibiting it from doing so for as long as the company remains a going concern, and inducing all Redditors to rely upon the promise.

Which leads me to my question (and, again, I appreciate that the company is open enough to even give this question a voice): why the decision to collect data from users rather than money? Does Reddit believe that the community is unsustainable if a small amount of money was collected each year? Has a study been done? Are there plans to exclude any Redditor's IP data if that Redditor purchases gold or some other subscription-based service?

I don't purchase Gold now. I realize that my voice rings hollow on this point. But if Reddit begins selling IP data, and if I could avoid that (relative to me) by buying Gold, I would do it.",False,False,False,17704,2049,1323811426.0,False,True

* Every time you get served an ad, Adzerk receives your IP address.  The policy does not state whether or not they get your username, so I'll assume they will.  In any case many users will allow them to retain tracking cookies to keep track of the IP addresses between sessions.

* Adzerk can (and presumably will) share ""aggregated non-personally identifiable information"" with publishers i.e. advertisers.  As pointed out above, your IP address isn't considered PII, so I'll assume any publisher can get the entire list of IP addresses you've used to access Reddit.

* How to use this:  Suppose you want to humiliate, say, some Democratic congressional staffers, because you're a Republican.  You figure, probably some of them have gone in to Wikipedia from home to fluff up their candidate's article or to make rude comments about their opponents.  On Wikipedia the IP addresses of non logged in users are listed publicly, but it is treated as ""anonymous"" because if they're on some residential ISP who knows who they are?  So you strike a deal with one of the many advertisers to get the list of associated IP addresses from Reddit.  _Now_ you look up all the known IP addresses of Democratic political offices (I imagine the hard-core Republicans know those pretty much by heart) and look them up in the Adzerk data that you've gotten via the publisher, and now search all the IP addresses that they _share a Reddit account with_ in the entire dataset of Wikipedia IP addresses to see which ones have edited.  You then go through these looking for anything juicy.  The result, eventually, is that you have (I think) a Reddit account name, a Wikipedia IP address's edit history, a congressional office, all linked up.  After that you can go to work with the power tools, looking up all the dox on one or a few targets that you can.  Result: some headline comes out about how Democratic political candidate(s) are associated with some plot to skew Wikipedia.

Coming to a forum like this one and expressing their problem is a way to seek help, but that doesn't mean they are letting you (the moderators) nor us (the users) decide what's best for them. 

This is the case for political issues too. People rebel, people gossip, people blow whistles. They all do these things believing that this forum is a safe place for them, one in which they can express whatever they want. 

The second you take a legal obligation to share critical information about any one of these groups (and many more, sexuality is one that comes to mind), you both put yourself in a position where you can not just keep your mouth shut to keep the person's life private (you've taken the responsibility legally, already) and also you place those people in a position where they can not continue to freely express their ideas.

Data itself isn't useful out of context. I'll see if I can explain:

The majority of websites traffic get sold into what's called an 'rtb exchange' - and advertisers can upload ads/destination url's (these typically go through tracking url's that you set up first) and you place bids for these ads based on available targets. 

Country obvious it is the most important target, If I'm promoting an ad for Kia for their US launch, ads going to users in India are basically throwing away money.
You can also target via url and/or broad demographics which is more just an educated assumption by the sites content (eg Oprah.com is going to be predominately North America female 30+ etc)
There's other targeting like session length, frequency of ad  to user , retargetting pixels etc

You can see how much traffic is available from any given site (recorded as impressions) - and you place a CPM bid in the auction to buy these impressions, these numbers only include users who successfully load a banner (so as an advertiser I never pay for an adblock user).

Raw information like analytics, isn't worth a tonne of money. It is for someone like google as it's a 'search engine' it can extrapolate intentions and trends in real time.

With reddit, aside from what everyone can see being upvoted on the front page, they don't have a whole lot more to offer as far as user analytics. Nothing that an advertiser is going to shell out millions of dollars for at least.

You're right that Initial user bases help with SEO rankings and users bring other users, but reddit has been large enough for quite some time that it no longer needs to worry keeping/getting un-monetizable users.

You just can't pretend someone who uses adblock and doesn't buy anything is an 'asset'.

The best you can say is that they're likely not much of a liability.

Also as of late last year Reddit was in the red, they 'hoped' to break even by 2014, this years financials haven't been outted, but they have to do something more to keep this site going and people like you telling everyone who's contributing less than nothing that they're *actually helping in anyway* isn't going to do reddit any favours.

the fact that they are doing it without an opt-out when there is (judging by the comments) a portion of their userbase that finds it really creepy points it toward the greed side for me.

just because they are not physically turning into scrooge mcduck does not remove the possibility of greed from the equation. you may find it fine to trust them here, but in this climate i'm always a bit skeptical about stuff like this.

But you can't associate an IP address with an account when the address changes every whenever. It's so loosely tied to location that it's only ever good for ""general"" location approximations. 

It's so generic and widespread that any targeted information that google uses renders the use of IP addresses useless. Who wants to know ""oh this one location plus or minus 100 miles logged into a gmail account and then logged into reddit. We don't know who it is though, what their accounts are, but cool right?""

On mobile, google uses your location (if allowed), tracks your cookies if you're logged in to google services, tracks places you ""check into"" or ""+1"", they track cookies if you use google chrome. 

But even *then*, all of that stuff is done in an anonymized way 99% of the time. In order to even ""get"" the information readable by human eyes, court orders need to be made, fusses need to be raised, gigabytes of logs need to be parsed to find your information, assuming they can even find it (pretty much impossible if you care even remotely about privacy), etc etc.

Firstly, let's start with the idea of life and ownership. Many people have many different ideas about politics. Some people find the idea of a government necessary, some find it problematic. Some like solid, static law, some like one that adapts. Some are of the left wing, some are of the right. Some are outside the spectrum. Many of them are so different from each other that they're incompatible. However, they all have one common principle. Well, except for just a few. That principle is the ownership of self. You can be whoever you want, you can do whatever you want, you can speak whatever you want, you can believe whatever you want. However, you can not stop someone else from doing so. That is where your freedom ends and another's begins. I find reddit, in general, to be in support of this idea. Subreddits like /r/trees, /r/anarchism, /r/atheism and /r/Christianity... etc all show that people are free to do whatever they want. However, I believe the recent change has a huge potential to damage this. 

One argument against privacy when it comes to matters like drugs and suicide is that people might not be mentally stable, and thus need someone else to decide for them in specific scenarios. I understand that. Personally, I'm in conflict with this idea, however I can see its merits. Back on topic, this idea is actually used a lot in the sub /r/depression. Many people come saying they're fed up and want to die. I see a lot of commenters saying that they're actually wrong. That they don't mean it. That they could've ended their lives, but didn't. Because they don't want to. That's why they sook help. That's why they posted about it. I believe this to be true, and I believe without simple connections like this sanity wouldn't be a fact, but just an illusion. However, that is also a topic by itself, and I don't have much time left to derail. 

Another thing, which I'll talk about shortly is, a person has every right to end his life. I don't want anyone to, I'll try to make them stop with my words if I can, I'd use force if I knew the person myself. However, I can not cause problems to someone I don't even know based on a single comment on a website. Proof is necessary when matters get this serious, and the news don't care about such things. If such a thing, even mistakenly, is announced about a person, their life is pretty much destroyed. Their job, friends... Even family might think differently of them. Do you think this'll reduce or increase the chances of another attempt? 

Lastly, there are many other cases where such information can be asked. For example, I believe reddit is based in America. Therefore, they have to abide by their laws. (or even if I'm mistaken, wherever they're based has its own laws). They can choose not to record information so no one can ask for it. But if they choose to, then they'll be forced to share if they're given a legal order to. This would be detrimental because many people wouldn't be able to share their thoughts anymore. It's basically increasing the chances of taking the problems about police states in the real world and bringing them to this forum.

If by simplifying, you mean getting to the crux of the matter and actually identifying the problem, then sure... guilty as charged.

The problem is, all you've done is throw out justifications and talk *around* the topic.  You haven't disproved or even denied my original comment.  In all those words, the best you could do is accuse me of ""simplifying"" something.

One of the problems in explaining something simply is that the truth becomes evident, rather than obscured behind a forest of reasons and excuses.

There are, and always will be, people who are so precious about the possibility of a minor inconvenience to their privacy, they will happily put in place a set of requirements so strict that they become ridiculous in the face of a possible human catastrophe.  If given a genuine belief that a person's life is in danger, or that they are about to harm others, the privacy zealot will sit on their high throne of judgment and deny the possibility of action, because there might be the chance that the police would be called unnecessarily.  Better to avoid that and risk a preventable death, than vice-versa.

And therein lies the rub.  It's not admirable or even intelligent to insist on this rigorous enforcement of privacy.  In fact it's a failure.  We are admitting, as a social group, that we are so utterly unable to apply the human reasoning and discernment that sets us apart from earthworms, that we have to rely on totalitarian enforcement of principles.  We've lost the ability to be human and to make human decisions, and can only rely on rigid and unbending rules.  What a tragic loss of freedom *that* is.

Worded in your style, we humans have forgotten that being nosy and deciding for everyone else doesn't make us human, the ability to shut up and accept others have their own realities.

We have the right to express ourselves and say that we don't think it is a good idea, but we can not decide that their answer is wrong, for it might be right for them.
