Reddit is supposed to be a platform, a platform that you can interact with in many different ways (multiple web UIs targeted at desktop and mobile, apps, 3rd party stuff, etc).  You interact with it in whichever way works best for you, and that's a good thing because it's more useful for more people.  

As such, any new features like this should be device-neutral- able to be accessed from any device.  Otherwise (even in a beta test) you are screening out not only most of the users, but many demographics of users, from giving any feedback.  

I personally would love to try this but I almost exclusively browse Reddit through old.reddit.com (desktop) or i.reddit.com (mobile).  I also use an Android phone.  So I literally *cannot* try this feature.

Your posted criteria [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/e1244tv/) look good on the face of it.  However there are communities that fit those guidelines but also have an extreme bias one way or another, and (on a community/voting level) don't welcome or tolerate alternative viewpoints very much.  
I don't mind a community that has a slant one way or the other, as long as the community (both moderators and users) are tolerant of opposing ideas and are willing to engage in discussion without mass-downvoting well-thought-out but opposing posts.  If that is not the case, then such subreddits should not be included in news.  ",False,False,1529603869.0,418828,14673,1329528395.0,False,True

This is not entirely true. You solicited feedback from /r/Bitcoin mods on 3 separate occasions (4 separate occasions now, because OP just messaged us again soliciting more feedback.). We asked you each time for specifics on WHAT we should be reviewing (because there are no visible changes) and HOW news threads were being aggregated. On all 3 occasions we were completely ignored, and therefore were unable to provide any feedback at all. *Moderators have no indication whatsoever which posts are visible in the News section*, and it is unlikely that reddit admins have done enough to curate fake, clickbait, and plagiarist news domains.

We have set guidelines for the communities that filter into the experience, as well as the post type (for example: posts titles must reflect the article title). 

This isn't good enough. The problem with news sources and the internet in general lately is the overwhelming amount of biased, fake or exploitative articles and posts submitted online. This ranges from political beliefs, organisations paying for headlines and covert advertising all the way to simply segregating people into two different groups with opposing opinions. How are you / how have you dealt with this issue? What features are in place that will make Reddit a trustworthy news source and not a completely biased and manipulated one?

So far, from the .gif above, you've shown nothing other than a filter of sorts. This is barely a news tab but rather a ""categories"" tab and the implication that it is a source for news is just dangerous. Certain subreddits, some/one of which was/were displayed in the .gif, have natural biases that either link to or slightly modify articles that have a blatant preference in whatever it is they're reporting on. You can't guarantee the authenticity of a piece of 'news' either - who's to say that a manipulative post doesn't get a lot of attention, is shown on the News tab and then falsely feeds its browsers and lurkers information that is incorrect? Sure, the mods should be monitoring this stuff but if they link to an article and the headline is the same as the one in the Reddit post then they're not breaking any rules; now imagine that article and headline is now completely and utterly false and its objective is to push a narrative or promote discontent. 

You could've seriously used this as a new and effective tool that'd draw in more users whilst still going against the current trend of 'dangerous news' but instead you decided to follow other large sites such as Facebook and Twitter - both of which suffer severely from, and are the main offenders for, the exact 'dangerous news' I just mentioned. This could've become something like Elon Musk's idea called ""Pravda"" or the already implemented website [allsides](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) where the authenticity and leaning of a source could be judged anonymously. Alas, this will just further contribute to the ongoing issues with segregation and political beliefs.

Odd, from my experience r/worldnews tends to be a massive, systemic circlejerk of anti-Trump, anti-Russia, anti-Israel content. Users are discouraged from expressing their opinion because they don't want to get downvoted or insulted, (which is why subs such as r/The_Donald are so pervasively right-wing). If you want to make a change, get rid of the downvote feature. It will promote conversation at every point of the site and minimize segregation, which is a very real concept that very few address. If someone is insulting another user, there is a Report feature for that. The downvote feature is a catalyst for isolating specific users with specific views in specific areas of Reddit. Unless that's what you're going for, of course. That's why it's impossible to find a genuinely neutral source of news, because outlets such as CNN or Fox News tailor specifically to their respective audience, regurgitating exactly what their readers want to hear so as to not induce cognitive dissonance.

This list helped us to identify communities that met a minimum threshold of engagement with posts from the domain list.

>  
>The community must have active moderation  
>  
>The community must require that the post title accurately reflects the article title

Reddit is supposed to be a platform, a platform that you can interact with in many different ways (multiple web UIs targeted at desktop and mobile, apps, 3rd party stuff, etc).  You interact with it in whichever way works best for you, and that's a good thing because it's more useful for more people.  

As such, any new features like this should be device-neutral- able to be accessed from any device.  Otherwise (even in a beta test) you are screening out not only most of the users, but many demographics of users, from giving any feedback.

Your posted criteria [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/e1244tv/) look good on the face of it.  However there are communities that fit those guidelines but also have an extreme bias one way or another, and (on a community/voting level) don't welcome or tolerate alternative viewpoints very much.  
I don't mind a community that has a slant one way or the other, as long as the community (both moderators and users) are tolerant of opposing ideas and are willing to engage in discussion without mass-downvoting well-thought-out but opposing posts.

*As news of the Orlando mass shooting broke on Sunday, internet users turned to the /news subreddit to find out what was going on. But instead of the breaking news and comment they were expecting, they found comments deleted and threads locked. Even information about how to give blood was blocked.*

*Unbelievably, the most detailed discussion of the events in Orlando ended up taking place on the /The_Donald subreddit - not the place you'd expect to have to look for unbiased news.*

I don't mean to be presumptuous by that, rather, I just recognize that Reddit admins are human.  And when you spend your days talking about things like engagement stats and revenue per monthly active user and whatnot, it's easy to become focused on what you are trying to do (make money) and lose sight of what you are and why people love you (the platform).  

A perfect example of this is the old Digg redesign.  Kevin Rose had a vision for Digg- a place to curate the best of the news and whatnot.  But in implementing that, he lost sight of what he had- a community.  So with all the best intentions he launched Digg v4, and alienated most of his most loyal users.  While Digg was ignoring its community, Reddit was providing a fertile ground for communities to grow.  

Unfortunately, Rose didn't listen, and as a result Digg went from being one of the most popular sites on the Internet to a long-forgotten footnote in Web history.  

The great leader Dukhat once said, ""When others do a foolish thing, you should tell them it is a foolish thing. They can still continue to do it, but at least the truth is where it needs to be.""

It wasn't compounded with any hateful speech

It's a word, and if sad internet warriors can't handle words than that explains why they're here on the internet and not out confronting real hate speech, because they're pathetic facist losers who want to try and control the words that come out of other peoples mouths if these words don't fall into what **they** deem as socially acceptable, and in my opinion, that makes them a bunch of gay dumbasses.

free speech is impossible on the normie net now. and the places that are supposed to be free speech end up attracting an overpopulation of extrema which puts off anyone else from using it.

I would say maybe bitchute is the only okayish youtube equivalent type site. But for news and discussion, i mean you'd have to go to a chan [4 or 8] and thats usually just hard left and hard right. 

lets look at fundraising patreon alternatives. You have freestartr that was a professional approach alternative to patreon (patreon which has been breaking the unruh act in california pretty frequently -can't discriminate by political affiliation)

So what happened with the philosophy of ""if you don't like it build your own""? well  it ended up having its main payment processor suddenly reject freestartr after completion and finalisation of the deal and now its left relying on crypto and other stopgap measure to run.

If people's political ideology interferes in the very basis of hosting, domains, delisting from google, demonetisation from youtube, choices by people in mid level positions of power in payment processors, and so on, how can we say there is such a thing as free speech on the net? what happens when the politics you don't like is in power, the tools of reppression used on your ideological counterparts would then be used on you.


In fact the only thing not yet targeted by the far left [and me pointing it out makes it vulnerable] are the sites that help support superchats for things like irl streams or debates online. 

Once that is done, there is no free speech because free speech costs money.

I don't think it was completely glossed over. I remember there being a lot of frustration about that and front page posts at the time. I think people just felt powerless to do anything about it and felt Trump was a greater evil.

Not unlike how many conservatives who weren't fans of Trump's behavior still banded around him after the primaries due to what they felt was the greater evil of Hillary and liberalism.

Now onto your claim about CNN being better than Fox...

Here's an incredibly short list of times CNN has knowingly lied about things to advance an agenda:

1. [CNN editing video to create a lie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8Cn6boqcA&feature=youtu.be)

2. [CNN and Anderson Cooper lie about past reporting they've done, and pretend that audio of Hillary laughing about a child rape case is somehow ""not authenticated""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpwPwhvabi8&feature=youtu.be)

3. [Here's CNN's Don Lemon doing the exact same thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvb3MdgCZPw)

4. [Here's CNN pretending that looking at Wikileaks is illegal... But it's ok for them to do it... because they're the media...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg)

5. [Here's CNN coaching their ""focus group"" on what to say after the debate...  Spoiler, it's pro\-Hillary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI)

6. [CNN doesn't want to tell us what Trump *actually said*, so they'll just doctor his tweets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Eps97Mp_s)

7. [It's always so unfortunate when technical issues cause cuts in feed every time someone say something bad about Hillary... especially when they were with Bernie till the end!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw)

8. [Of course they would employ Donna Brazile, head of the DNC, who is happy to pass along debate questions to Hillary. At least until she got caught...](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-shared-additional-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign-identified-her-tipster/)

9. [And then the same thing happened for Wolf Blitzer. In fact, CNN got every DNC staffer's input on what questions they would like this ""impartial objective news service"" to ask Trump](http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/06/wikileaks-emails-cnn-asked-dnc-for-questions-for-interviews-with-trump-cruz/)

10. [Here they are backing down after being threatened with a lawsuit for calling Assange a pedophile](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/312654-wikileaks-threatens-cnn-with-defamation-suit-over-pedophilia-claim)

11. [Don Lemon identifies ""random protestor"" as a CNN technician, after an astroturfing spiel about the electoral college!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6izexFkN4)

Now please go ahead and show me how Fox did the same.  CNN is, with no doubt whatsoever, a fake news organization no matter how you define fake news.  For goodness sake, they pretended their cameraman in the field was a protester to advance the political agenda they wanted to advance.  That is verifiable fake news.  They colluded with the Hillary campaign to ensure that Hillary would know the debate questions in advance of the debate, that is actual collusion (as opposed to the bullshit Russia collusion).  So let's see your list of Fox doing anything like this.  Fox is certainly biased right, but they aren't fake news like CNN.

Here's Wikipedia's discussion of it:

>Algorithm
Through the use of ""sticky posts,"" a moderation function of Reddit that allows selected posts to be artificially placed at the top of a subreddit, the moderators of the forum were ""gaming"" the algorithms[76][77] in order to dominate the content on the /r/all page, which is a representation of the most popular content on the website.[3] Additionally, users are often apt to flood the website with waves of identical images or posts, a direct violation of site-wide policies regarding spam. In response, Huffman rolled out a change to the /r/all algorithm; he noted that /r/The_Donald was among several Reddit communities over the years that ""attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else.""[13] Ongoing problems with members of the subreddit brigading and harassing other subreddits forced Reddit staff to modify the site's software algorithms to limit the offending posts to the subreddit. The Reddit team introduced /r/popular to replace /r/all, which included most popular subreddits except for The_Donald, and as a result the subreddit could no longer reach the front page.[78][79] In February 2017, Reddit overhauled their algorithms even further to prevent content from the subreddit (among other communities) from ever being seen by logged out users or people who do not have a Reddit account.[46]

Where'd I do that? Please show me. 

That community was taken down for repeatedly and flagrantly violating Reddit's TOS about targeted harassment. Remember that? When FPH had an organized, concerted, subreddit-wide effort to bully and harass people who had nothing to do with the FPH subreddit? Reddit had every right to do that, but it wasn't because of illegality, it was because of a different content policy of the website.

Not feeling particularly persecuted at the moment. Illegal subs get taken down, albeit often way later than they should, and Reddit is better for it.

The [Legal Affairs (JURI) Committee proposal](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fTEXT%2bREPORT%2bA8-2018-0245%2b0%2bDOC%2bXML%2bV0%2f%2fEN&language=EN) lead by Axel Voss, MEP, was rejected with 278 voted for the proposal and 318 voted against it. What does t his mean? 

This is not the end, this does not mean that the Copyright Directive is off the table. The vote today was not about deleting Art 11 and 13. It's about having a full plenary debate and allowing amendments to improve those articles. Now, the file will be debated in the Parliament and open for amendments. 

There are alternatives (written by EPP members) on the table that would still protect authors but without collateral damage to the open internet ([article 11](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reda-compromise-11.pdf), [article 13](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/reda-compromise-13.pdf)). There is also room for improvement in many other articles that would benefit libraries, museum and schools. [Here is an overview by EBLIDA](http://www.eblida.org/News/2018/EBLIDA%20recap%20of%20JURI%20DSM%20vote%20of%2020%20june%202018_FINAL.pdf), *European Bureau of Library Information and Documentation Associations,* that might be useful for some to understand the scope of many of the amendments. 

What will happen next? 

Now, extreme lobbying will begin in the EP. What we need to be careful of is that some of the amendments of the JURI committee were actually quite good - when it comes to the public domain, preservation exception, educational exceptions, out of commerce work, etc. Getting those amendments into the state where we are now has been a lot of work and even though there is always room for improvement, then there is also room for good work to be undone. 

The focus needs to be on article 11 (the press publisher's right) and on article 13 (the 'filter') and also, in my opinion, on article 3 (text and data mining) and article 6 (Common provisions). 

This was merely one vote of many, the next vote will decide upon the Parliament's negotiating position in the Trilogues (between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament). When the trilogues are done, the decision is ratified by the Parliament and then within couple of years adopted into national law of your member states.

#Why shouldn't reddit have to share revenue with the content creators you sell advertisements against? 

You keep repeating this statement like it is a bad thing:

>and require licensing fees for all links.

Why is this bad? Why should reddit be able to host, via i.reddit, web comics and photographs of copyrighted content that doesn't belong to it, and only have to take it down *after* the copyright holder finds it and requests it? Why is ""forgiveness"" the only acceptable policy for you? Why does reddit not have a revenue sharing program like YouTube already in place, and why do you resist addressing repeated questions about it?

This is poorly written legislation as it was designed, but it's not a poor concept. You host content from copyrighted content that isn;t yours. Not just links to articles, but sometimes whole articles ripped from the source and reposted here. Half of your major content is just mild tweakings of content copyrighted by others. Most of the gif subs are straight rips outs of videos owned by someone else who gets no compensation for entertaining redditors, while you put advertisements against them.

**Why should reddit continue be able having a free lunch and not give back to the content creators whose stuff you use without asking to make a profit?**

You want us to defend you. I like reddit and want it to continue. So give us the sound reasoning who you shouldn't have to pay out, or have to restrict your site from making money off of content you're not authorized to host.

*****

The first is the obvious, bills like this don't just roll over and die. They take on new form, as some moron with an agenda to push attempts to force the same shitty legislation through under a different name. The reason? There's a lot of money to be made by controlling the internet.

Why? It's simple. The internet is pure, in most cases undiluted, information. The control of information is one of the most important things for anyone in power, and extreme power can be gained if someone were able to control a source of information as vast as the internet. Even partially, even temporarily.

So attempts will continue to be made to control this medium until the world has moved beyond the ability for any single power to control it. We have to always be vigilant against those who would try to exert unfavorable control and support those who would try to protect the free exchange of information the internet represents.

*****

The second one is less obvious. This is, what, the third or fourth time now an internet grassroots campaign has stopped a major legal attempt to control the internet like this? It's only a matter of time before people start acting on it, doing anything they can to disrupt these movements, or otherwise hijack them for their own cause.

As I said above, there's simply too much money being lost to continue to support this bad legislation. There's too much at stake in allowing the internet to remain the mostly-free information exchange it has been. The people behind these laws won't take our disruption lying down forever, they will eventually move to act against us. I'd like to think it will always be comically inept, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be on the lookout for people trying to disrupt movements like the ones taken against this law, or SOPA/PIPA, or the other variants that keep rearing their ugly heads.

Third, and finally, we need to be cautious of the sources we trust to tell us to act. This ties in to my second point, that people will try to hijack these movements towards their own ends if at all possible. 

Remember, reddit itself was one of the sites we trusted to tell us this was bad, and it also stood to lose tremendously should the bill have passed. This time, and last time, and probably even the next few times - because make no mistake, there will be more attempts - reddit will continue to operate in good faith. But there could come a point where our sources tell us one thing but hide another. Perhaps a law is drafted that doesn't affect the way we interact with the site very much, but reddit still tries to tell us it's terrible. Perhaps it's Facebook, or Google, or somewhere else instead of reddit. Should we still support them in their efforts to block the law? 

As the saying goes, trust, but verify. It's fine to trust what we're told, but we should never, ever blindly follow it. We need to verify that what is being said matches what is going to happen. This is the first line of defense against ensuring our freedoms are protected.",False,False,False,417449,3869,1397444034.0,False,False

Those small artists who receive no money, because of someone uploading their music, do have something to complain about, but this censorship is a solution that'll create more problems. I have a proposal for a solution for those artists, however:

Say you have made a great song as artist that could make you money. One time, someone decides to post it on a platform under their name. When people find out that person posted something thats not rightfully theirs, which that same person made money of, the person has to pay everything he/she earned from it and everything they will receive. This is no fee, this is no censorship and all the person has done now is given some free commercial of a song (or whatever copyrighted material). I also think that if for example the song was posted on YouTube and the one who owns it didnt post it on YouTube, YouTube has to pay back what they got from that video as well.

Why should an authority figure decide what contracts between two willing parties can contain?

>Why should reddit be able to host, via i.reddit, web comics and photographs of copyrighted content that doesn't belong to it, and only have to take it down after the copyright holder finds it and requests it?

What if the original copyright holder prefers it that way? What if I, a content creator, want my content available on Reddit to be freely perused by those who want to see it? Now about the theft thing. Say someone takes your lawn mower. They sell it to a pawn shop. Should the pawn shop really have to get the original proof of purchase or something similar from the seller before buying the lawn mower? Of course, if you come (typically with some authority figure) with proof the lawn mower is yours, they have to give it back. That's all good. The pawn shop doesn't have to pay some sort of fine, though, and they don't have to run every purchase through a database of owned lawn mowers that doesn't exist to buy a lawnmower, though. 

>Why is ""forgiveness"" the only acceptable policy for you?

Because it's the only technologically possible one that doesn't break the internet. 

>Why does reddit not have a revenue sharing program like YouTube already in place, and why do you resist addressing repeated questions about it?

That's a valid question. It'd be neat if they did, but I'd imagine the real reason has a few answers. First, they don't police what's on the site too hard. If they wanted to pay people for their content, suddenly, many people will view Reddit differently based on who they pay money to. It legitimizes some of the content. Second, I don't think Reddit could afford it off of ad revenue alone. Maybe they could just give users a cut of ad revenue, but I'm not in their accounting department. This one seems fixable, though. Third, reddit is all pseudo-anonymous. Lots of people post content here that would make them ashamed in their personal lives or is extremely personal information that they don't want associated with their real lives. 

Essentially, content creators get paid for their content through two things. The first is free hosting and publication of their content to an audience who is already interested. The second is the option to be pseudo-anonymous. That's why people don't get paid money here; they get paid a different resource.

>This is poorly written legislation as it was designed, but it's not a poor concept. You host content from copyrighted content that isn;t yours. Not just links to articles, but sometimes whole articles ripped from the source and reposted here. Half of your major content is just mild tweakings of content copyrighted by others. Most of the gif subs are straight rips outs of videos owned by someone else who gets no compensation for entertaining redditors, while you put advertisements against them.

Well, a decent amount of your examples are covered by fair use and parody, at least in the US. We can have a discussion about whether fair use and/or parody exceptions to copyright should exist, but blaming reddit for profiting off of fair use/parody and making it seem like they're doing something incredibly shady is disingenuous. 

>Why should reddit continue be able having a free lunch and not give back to the content creators whose stuff you use without asking to make a profit?

Without asking? The vast majority of content posted on reddit (comments included) is original content. If it's original content being posted by the creator (almost every single comment, btw), Reddit has already covered the 'asking' part. It's also not a 'free lunch'. They're hosting and publishing said content. They pay for that half of things. 

Now, if some redditor takes a picture they found on Tumblr and posts it to reddit without the author's consent, there's an argument to be had. Still, if we include comments in the 'content' part (which we should), Reddit is mostly OC.

>So give us the sound reasoning who you shouldn't have to pay out

Because they pay to host the massive community here in exchange for the content.

>have to restrict your site from making money off of content you're not authorized to host

This is a good question, but I'd say the biggest reason is it doesn't work well. YouTube's system is ridiculously bad and is abused all the time. I can't think of a great system that isn't heavily abused. Maybe we should be working towards one, but we're not there quite yet. ",False,False,False,108815,20135,1351806672.0,False,True

Many, many people who seek comfort or want to share a negative results experience and keep it private (sexual assault, domestic abuse, etc) would be forced to either not or legally associate their account with their identity. 

I'm not saying there isn't a problem that needs to be addressed. I'm saying that forcing people to fully associate their legal selves with their online selves in order to disseminate content means we'll see a lot less content that isnt socially acceptable or could be dangerous to share. 

I'm really not sure what the solution is.

Oh bull-fucking-shit. The internet existed long before advertisements shitted the place up, and it'll keep right on existing if every marketing department falls over dead. It's just cables and boxes, miles and miles of it. You don't need anyone's blessing to publish -- that was the entire point! TCP/IP was created to treat all traffic equally. All are peers. There are no servers and clients. The network doesn't care what you are, it's just the messenger -- just a tool. 


The argument you're making would have us all under the boot of the same ""benevolent"" dictatorship that musicians and playwrights are under -- the MPAA and RIAA, who control the means of distribution and take the lion's share of anything an artist could make from their work. They get fat while the artists starve, and that's the model you're backing. And big fucking surprise -- YouTube is making a killing and yet out of how many tens of thousands of bloggers trying to make it on the platform... how many of them actually are? People spend hours and hours on that site, eating face after face full of advertising, and how much of that is making it to the people who make Youtube anything more than a digital graveyard? Almost nothing. Just like pre-internet media.


Get a grip. Piracy isn't killing artists -- the people who control the means of distribution are. And for the record, art predates even the written word. There have always been artists -- and they don't do it for monetary gain, or to shit out advertisements. There's no ""ENJOY COKE"" next to the cave paintings of early humans. Art will happen because it's intrinsic to the human condition. And because it's so important to the preservation and advancement of our culture, and a part of who we are, we establish ways of giving them money to support those endeavors.


But they're not motivated by money, and shame on you for thinking it can only spring from money. Look around at the art that money makes -- it's formulaic, boring, and contributes no lasting value to a culture. But the labors of love, the artists who bleed onto our books, our screens, our ears? They last. They don't seek riches or fame... they seek something else entirely, that I don't think you could ever understand.

If a third party is successful due to spamming like what youtube neglectfully encouraged for so long. Then you ban those accounts maliciously breaking the system and perhaps send their info into some gov criminal agency.

I think with the whole YouTube debacle, it's been shown that the DCMA while perhaps a good idea in theory is unworkable and prone to abuse. The DCMA needs to be scrapped and replaced by laws designed by people who are actually qualified and don't hold a vested interest in the way the laws work. Politicians in this case are not qualified, don't adequately understand the material, and often design their legislation around who as handed them the most money under the table.

> > How would you like to deal with literally thousands of websites to claim your share of the revenue?

> Thats the point though, the enitre thing is ""your share"", should it morally and legally be Reddit's share to monetize on something they didnt create and are directly encouraging people steal. This even close to Google who is only an aggregate for links and sometimes adds context in those links. This is directly taking other people's content and making money off it, just like Facebook (look up smarter every day for a video on it)

Technically Reddit does not take peoples content and monetize it. Reddit is a platform completely beholden to it's users. It's the users who find the content and ""share"" it on Reddit. Reddit makes it's money from the commenting and shitposting that gets done. The site could very well function without the ability to link to other content, see subreddits the likes of /r/iAmA, /r/AskReddit, etc. There is plenty to do on Reddit that doesn't involve infringement of 3rd party copyrights.

> > already been resolved in the Music industry

> There are significantly better avenues for music artists which dont require getting fucked over. You dont have to register with anyone, there is no reason why you need to register with a licensing body anymore. There are actually services which on behalf of you take down infringing content without bending you over

Ok, so content creators could find one of many 3rd party services to police their content but they are still only going to receive cents in the dollar. Sure, it may be more than a central authority, it also may be less and beholden with conditions like a minimum monthly earn before you get paid, etc. The whole system will be open for abuse and profiteering.

> > the Free Publicity back to your website where you can make your money would be better than the cents-in-the-dollar you would make from paid links.

> Thats not up to Reddit to force that opinion on others, some like exposure. Some loathe the idea of ""your being paid in exposure"" because they have to put money on the table and dont have a need for being paid in that currency

If I made content, my personal belief is Sure, link all you want to my content, so long as you do it in a way that directs the traffic to me in order for me to make my money off my own sponsors/ads, metrics, etc. Hotlinking to the content directly is a shitty thing to do.

> and stating its fine because its only a little bit of money per click, is like saying nigerian scammers are fine because they only take a few cents from millions of people every day

Using your analogy, Reddit would be a place for people to say ""Hey, check out this Nigerian scammer I found, they seem really cool!"" It's not Reddit who went out to find them. Then again, if you look at the way the Internet works, the whole system is based on linking content. It's as if the internet was build around the idea of free-flow of information without being encumbered by restriction. To turn around and require payment for links is destroying the core of how the internet was designed.

That being said, my belief really is Copyright has been abused by big content for too long and needs to be rationalized. Copyright should not be automatic but if you want protection the content should be freely registered with a central Copyright authority before you make it public. Even if you plan to give it away the central authority knows about the content. This way the copyright is firmly established and cannot be abused.

Then the copyright for companies should only be valid for a period of 25 years with the option to extend for another 25 provided they can provide evidence their works are still being commercially exploited by the company. If the copyright is held by an individual then copyright should expire upon their death plus 25 years. This way, a work will be copywritten for a more than reasonable period. Copyright was never intended to be perpetual and provide a creator a means to earn a reasonable living from their works before it becomes public domain.

Artists' painstaking endeavours should be compensated. Throughout the centuries artists have relied on patronage (or independent wealth but thats a whole other story) to survive. If you don't compensate artists, you reinforce a social hierarchy where only the richest and most privileged have the freedom to truly create great art. Creating great art takes time and often substantial resources, and if you're spending all your time hustling something else to stay afloat then you simply don't have the same time or energy to invest in art. That's a fact. Not to mention how much stress and anxiety come from worrying about money. Creativity requires a sense of playfulness and joy and money worries can eat you up.

An Internet meme ( MEEM) is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of media that spreads, often as mimicry or for humorous purposes, from person to person via the Internet. An Internet meme may take the form of an image (typically an image macro), hyperlink, video, website, or hashtag. It may be just a word or phrase, sometimes including an intentional misspelling. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources.

2690,7if8i,e1v4d9o,t1_e1uz2f8,t3_8we31l,1530837077.0,6,"So are you just trying to find out why I support him? It's easy. I originally didn't like him. I hated him. He was uncouth, and arrogant. Once I found out he was running for president I thought he was a joke. I was still trying to decide who I planned on supporting. Well, I started looking at everybody's policies, and being somewhat liberal all my life, Trump wasn't an option.. Hillary, well that's another story. I thought she was a blatant Criminal and was getting away with it because she was a political Elite. I had those feelings before Donald Trump, and even more so during the election year. Once I saw Trump was serious about running for the presidency, I looked up what his position was on everything. This was the first time that I saw any candidate who focused so much on America, and the American people. This surprised me, bigly. Not only that, but I had just spent the past few years reading stories about politicians being paid off via campaign donations, and basically being tied to their contributors wishes. Once I read that Donald Trump was self-funding, along with the help of his supporters, his campaign... That was another big push for me into supporting him. Politicians have been getting rich off of our country for a long time, and that infuriated me. Out of the blue, here comes someone with no political background, self funding his campaign (no donors to owe), putting America first, and telling other politicians like it was. That was it for me. 

I completely understand his rhetoric, as well as the way that he talks about himself comes off sometimes. Hell, every time even. To me, that's a small price to pay for the type of leader I wanted to rally behind. The politicians I just spoke about taking donations in exchange for favors? I related them with the swamp that Trump spoke about. 

Now, you on the other hand have a much different story. Both of our stories have let us to this point. They are both very different. We see current events through totally different filters. We both have biases. That's natural, and it's Human Nature. I told myself in the beginning then I would support Donald Trump until his actions, and by that I mean provable actions, go against what I believe in. So far, everything that has been said against him, is mostly unproven and it's speculation. For example, when the topic of Russia comes up, I don't immediately think that he did it and therefore anything that is said has to be true. My perspective is that he deserves to be treated innocent until he is aquitted or charged via the Mueller investigation. I trust that the special counsel is doing its job, and I will disregard biased news stories with Anonymous sources, I will not let them affect my thinking, until I see a result from the actual investigation started for this particular matter. 

You and I both know how biased the news and media can be. We both should know, through critical thinking, that there are narratives to push. That being said, I will always take things released by the media with a grain of salt.

I believe Trump has good intentions, I don't believe he's a racist or sexist or a white nationalist, or nazi, or any of the hundreds of names he has been called since becoming president. I can say this confidently because I have thoroughly researched everything that comes out as a news story, and every time like clockwork, I see that it's either sensationalized or blown way out of proportion. Every time this happens it discredits the media in my eyes. If the liberal media didn't meltdown every time Donald Trump does anything no matter how trivial, then that wouldn't be my position. When stories hit the top of Reddit daily like a joke you made to the Canadian Prime Minister, or that he forgot the words to a song that isn't very well known in the first place, it reinforces my stance. 

I hope this gives you some insight on how people can be Trump supporters and disregard everything that comes out against him on a daily basis. You are still going to have your beliefs, and I'm going to have mine. This will likely never change, because we have different stories and different paths to our belief systems. I'm okay with that, I just wish we could get along.

Then the original pasta-replier returns to claim that, in his experience, the gaming community is racist/sexist/rapey.

You then reply refuting a claim nobody made, namely that gaming doesn't make you any of those things.

What am I missing here?

Regardless, I'm a gamer and I have been for two decades now. I've frequented gaming related discussion boards for most of that, and I don't really disagree with the claim. I'd say it's a very poor way to express what you mean, as the political incorrectness of the statement will rile people up (such as yourself) and cause a very defensive response. A better way to put it, I'd say, is that compared to school or work, social gaming can expose you to a lot of the aforementioned behavior at a degree you simply don't experience elsewhere.

I'm also sure that part of the reason incivility runs rampant in gaming is because, as you say, anonymity.

The [Unfair Advantage](http://deepfreeze.it/article.php?a=unfair) article is a decent place to start. 

None of the articles Grayson wrote covering her were reviews, which is the origin of your denial - some people on the internet who heard about the controversy assumed that a conflict of interest involving a game reviewer must be about a game review, but actually the conflict of interest was for other kinds of coverage. Zoe's business model wasn't even about selling games, it was building and then monetizing her personal brand. Note that from the beginning the actual articles and videos on the controversy (like the original ""Quinnspiracy"" video) got this right and called it ""coverage"" rather than ""reviews"".

Grayson and Quinn [were already friends](https://pastebin.com/1ePCqJLz) when the GAME_JAM article was published, itself sufficient for a personal conflict of interest, and became sexually involved within a week afterwards. Two days after the article was published, Grayson and Zoe went on their [planned trip to Vegas together](http://i.imgur.com/TVY3bUg.jpg), during which they first slept together according to what [Grayson said to Totilo](http://archive.is/8KjOG#selection-2701.287-2701.302) and [Zoe in TZP chatlogs](http://archive.is/RfAp7#selection-781.185-781.198).

Grayson's excuse to Totilo (which Totilo accepted) was that since they supposedly didn't have sex until a few days after the article was published, they weren't in a ""relationship"" at the time, so even though they were at the very least friends before than and were doing stuff like planning trips to Vegas indicating their blatant personal conflict of interest, it's apparently fine with Kotaku.",False,False,False,69478,34694,1432333232.0,False,False

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian government.

Reddit, like all too many online communities, are all too keen on patting themselves on the back when things happen to go the way they hoped, regardless of the actual facts. Now if you want to talk about the *actual* major contributors... Here are a few:

- Religious leaders. The evangelicals, led from the pulpit of local churches, voted Trump in massive droves, with white evangelicals being **by far** the most single-mindedly Republican demographic.
- Conservative radio. These guys have a long history of influencing the masses.
- Conservative TV media. Fox News is the obvious one, but you can't forget about [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo) and their widespread control of local TV channels.

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:



Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

From the paper you linked:

>The relationship between concepts like open-access, network neutrality, and broadband discrimination may be unclear to the reader.  It is best to understand network neutrality as an end, and open access and broadband discrimination as different means to that end.  In this section we will examine both why network neutrality might be an attractive goal, and, how an open-access and broadband discrimination regime differ as means toward that end.

One example in his paper that goes against the idea of Network Neutrality:
> They are suspicious of models of development that might vest control in any initial prospect-holder, private or public, who is expected to direct the optimal path of innovation, minimizing the excesses of innovative competition.12 

I think it's clear that you and many others who are behind the 'net neutrality' buzz haven't actually read this paper, where he brings up many cases of where discrimination on the network can be beneficial and is used already.  He also speaks about how discrimination can be used as a means to an end to achieve network neutrality.

As I said, the idea of 'net neutrality' is debatable when dealing with the government and law.  What is 'neutral', and who determines what that definition of 'neutral' is?  I prefer the idea that business decide what is neutral, as businesses will decide based on market research and use, not political maneuvering and ideals.  This is where the real debate lies in 'net neutrality', who controls it.  The businesses or the government.  Taking a quick look at the government and seeing that they can't manage their way out of a wet paper bag, many come to the conclusion that it's better off without their meddling.",False,False,False,18324,49,1411239038.0,False,False

Edit: If you are affected, then the hackers won't have *much* info on you:

* **Signed up before May 2007?** The hackers will have your username, salted and hashed passwords (~~pretty much useless to hackers~~ hard to crack, but still change your password!!!), email address (bit of a shame but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯), and any posts/PMs you sent back then. They may also have web logs, which would tie an IP address with your account, so people will know the general area of where you're posting from. This can sometimes be linked back to specific organizations/companies if you browse Reddit using some wifi spots/company internet (e.g. browsing reddit at work).

* **Had digest emails from Reddit during early June this year?** This only applies for digest emails where Reddit suggests posts to you or something (no clue how it works, I don't use that service). Password changes etc weren't taken/leaked, so nothing was leaked if you just changed your password last month (though changing it again couldn't *hurt*). If you received advertising emails, the hackers have a copy of the email Reddit sent, which includes your username and some suggested posts from **SFW** subs you're subscribed to.

Worst case scenario is that someone connects a username to your reddit account via your email address - for example, if your email is john_doe@email.com and your username is something silly like ""Jackeea"", then they'll have a good guess at your real name, and will know which reddit account you use (the horror!) If you desperately don't want people IRL knowing what you post on reddit, [delete any ""incriminating"" posts](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data) although it's unlikely that much will come of this unless you post your credit card info on your user page.",False,False,1533150547.0,263776,179245,1432473753.0,False,True

It is just so unfortunate. I am aware [removed] is your pass word. Moreover, I know your secret and I've proof of this. You do not know me personally and nobody paid me to examine you. 

It's just your hard luck that I came across your misdemeanor. In fact, I placed a malware on the adult vids (porn material) and you visited this web site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your web browser began functioning as a Rdp (Remote control desktop) with a key logger which provided me access to your display screen and cam. After that, my software program gathered every one of your contacts from social networks, and e-mail. 

After that I put in more time than I probably should have digging into your life and generated a double screen video. 1st part displays the recording you had been watching and second part shows the view of your web camera (its you doing dirty things).

Honestly, I am ready to forget all information about you and let you continue with your regular life. And I am going to provide you two options which will achieve that. These two options are either to ignore this letter, or perhaps pay me $1200. Let us examine these two options in details. 

Option One is to ignore this e mail. You should know what will happen if you opt this option. I will send out your video to your entire contacts including close relatives, colleagues, and so forth. It does not help you avoid the humiliation your self will face when friends and family learn your unpleasant videos from me. 

Second Option is to send me $1200. We’ll name it my “privacy charges”. Now lets see what will happen if you pick this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I will destroy the video immediately. You keep your daily life as if none of this ever occurred. 

Now you may be thinking, “I should call the cops”. Without a doubt, I've covered my steps to ensure this e mail cannot be traced time for me and yes it won't prevent the evidence from destroying your life. I'm not trying to dig a hole in your pocket. I am just looking to get compensated for time I placed into investigating you. Let's assume you've decided to create this all disappear and pay me my confidentiality fee. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know how, type ""how to buy bitcoins"" in google) 

Transfer Amount: $1200 
Bitcoin Address to Send: 1P4xHsXFXHK*ZrBJ5jCdSoNptHb3N6hXEuM ( You must Remove * from this string and copy and paste it carefully) 

Expalin no-one what you would be transferring the bitcoin for or they might not give it to you. The task to get bitcoins will take a few days so do not put it off.
I have a specific pixel in this email message, and now I know that you've read through this mail. You have 48 hours to make the payment. If I do not get the BitCoins, I definitely will send your video to all your contacts including family members, coworkers, and so on. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the proof and all other proofs immediately. It is a non negotiable one time offer, thus kindly do not waste my personal time & yours. Your time has started. You should be aware that my malware will still be keeping tracking of the actions you adopt when you are done reading this message. To be honest, If I see any wrong activity from your browser history then I will have to send out your sextape to your close relatives, colleagues before your time finishes.


Edit: Just to add I knew it was a scam.  I received the email on July 31st at 02:55am.  This was the only account that I used that basic password that has had a security scare recently.

1. Does Reddit have a bug bounty program? If so, can you provide a link to it? It's hard to Google for anything to do with Reddit because Google's algo thinks I'm looking for normal Reddit content.

With that said, can you please shed any light on ***how*** **the passwords were hashed and salted?** Digging into the legacy codebase online, I found this:

      ...      
            # alright, so it's not bcrypt. how old is it?
            # if the length of the stored hash is 43 bytes, the sha-1 hash has a salt
            # otherwise it's sha-1 with no salt.
            salt = ''
            if len(compare_password) == 43:
                salt = compare_password[:3]
            expected_hash = passhash(a.name, password, salt)
    
            if not constant_time_compare(compare_password, expected_hash):
                return False
    
        # since we got this far, it's a valid password but in an old format
        # let's upgrade it
        if convert_password:
            a.password = bcrypt_password(password)
            a._commit()
        return a
    
    ...
    
    def passhash(username, password, salt = ''):
        if salt is True:
            salt = randstr(3)
        tohash = '%s%s %s' % (salt, username, password)
        return salt + hashlib.sha1(tohash).hexdigest()

See: [https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/blob/ea8f0b72c50f1f174a26e3ba66a4f784e4462f2e/r2/r2/models/account.py#L873-L900](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/blob/ea8f0b72c50f1f174a26e3ba66a4f784e4462f2e/r2/r2/models/account.py#L873-L900)

This implies that the hashing/salting method probably is **single pass SHA1** and also highlights the **use of a weak salt**, which is only 3 alphanumeric bytes. **The most concerning bit is the homegrown salting function, which does not contain any form of a work factor such as PBKDF2.**

In addition, it also implies that the SHA1 to bcrypt conversion was performed upon login, rather than hash wrapping the legacy passwords. **Does this mean there are still SHA1 hashes within Reddit's current production databases?**

Interesting comments around GDPR happening in here, my 2 cents.

* First, GDPR applies to any company worldwide as soon as they process personal information of European citizens.
* Any company not having offices in the EU (like reddit and their owners) can LOL about it. AFAIK there is no treaty in place to enforce any fines or legal actions outside of the EU.
* But, its still a serious issue. At least on paper it has strict enforcements, for real life scenarios the next years will show how they will be actually handled. In the reddit case, b) is valid, but due to personal accountability under GDPR for upper management (C-Levels, Directors, ...) they still could get into trouble.

If Reddit's IT department was notified of the hack by admins whose accounts were compromised, then why did it take 96 hours for management to revoke the hacker's access to Reddit's files? 

Had the infosec manager previously setup a notification alarm which alerted the IT dept when those admins started ""browsing"" old 2007 system backups?

Why do you assume it was a single hacker working over 4 days and not multiple hackers working together?

Do you know if the computer forensics investigator figured out any exact YYYY:MM:DD:HH:MM:SS timestamps for when your files were accessed? 

What was the **exact** moment in time Reddit's infosec manager realized that Reddit was being hacked -- was it like a slow and steady investigation into the compromised administrator accounts -- or did he/she realize it immediately but it just took him/her 4 days to figure out how to end the ""hack-in-progress"" without affecting anything else? ⌨️ Or did Reddit's infosec manager attempt to revoke their access multiple times over the course of 96 hours before eventually succeeding (like ""a hack off"" type scenario) in reencrypting/securing the servers?

Did you not realize Reddit had been hacked until after the hacker(s) already downloaded a bunch of user data and salted hashes & then logged out? 

Just wondering.

They'd need a large power source and a large antenna to be able to replicate the effects of a stingray. Ask SFPD to look at security camera footage for vans in the area of 3rd street with large antennas at the time of the hack, and to cross check the cell tower logs to see if they are any discrepencies in the time stamps.

Was this a localized attack where the data was some how captured, in a sort of tower spoofing method or along those lines? That would require the actor to be within a few blocks, unless they had a strong antennuation/large antenna. Maybe it was accomplished by social engineering an employee of the tele/cellphone company. Usually in this case they obtain a password of the day. Suffice to say, this password is used to escalate their powers. They can proceed to change the SIM card for any giving number to a new one, in this case, their own. After activating the phone's SIM card under their newly obtained number they can then send the 2FA code and viola. I have another method that I've never seen used before and it works quite successfully, though in this case you are left wondering why you just called yourself. 

By the way, I'm available for hire. I've never had any formal education and instead decided on a path that proves my capabilities rather than documentation. I exploited Twitter in April 2009 along with much else. My very minimal website is located at http://mikeyy.com (sorry SSL is being weird, hopefully I fix it before you gander!)

I’m not too bothered about losing the account, I don’t mind abandoning it, but I’m trying to figure out if my details were compromised. The account is maybe 18 months old so not part of the first scenario, and I’ve never received email digests so I thought maybe I wasn’t part of the second.

Multi-Factor is based on the use of separate medium to make interception harder, forcing attackers to get foothold in completely different systems requiring completely different skillsets and expertise.

Lol... we only have 50,000,000 users... but they couldn't write anything.

Do you need live evidence for any issue?

Do you need immunity and protection for your online accounts?

Perhaps you need the immunity and protection for your block chain account?

Every hack is untraceable and invincible such that the target never knows that they're been hacked or spied on

Do you want to know if you are hacked or spied on...?

Perhaps you have been scammed and you wanna get your money back.

This post has been reviewed by the Repost Review Board and was found to violate the following articles:

Article 1(1): Do not repost without proper attribution to the original post or site.

Article 1(7): Do not violate article 1(1).

Article 3(4): Any violation(s) of previous articles also violates this article.

This post has been found to be reposting ""[Name of the fucking post](The fucking link)"". Therefore, you have been ordered by the Repost Review Board to delete this post or add proper attribution immediately. You may appeal these charges in the r/KarmaCourt.

Proper attribution is defined as: a comment which links the original post or site that the content has been copied from.

The Repost Review Board would like to inform you that the act of reposting is an unethical practice as it is a form of stealing. Reposting is a theft of intellectual property and karma from the original author. Reposting also causes original content on the sub feed to be replaced with old, boring stuff that we have already seen. The fact that reposts can gain as much karma as the original discourages Redditors from producing new content.

If you have any questions about this notice, you may reply to this comment, or contact the Repost Review Board by email (reeeeee@poooost.com), by phone (1-800-ASS-CLAP), or by pigeon mail (that way).",False,False,False,18840,8242,1524670758.0,False,True

Most people are careful about what they post in the public, but I don't think it is such a problem about this public information and password hashes... I assume the hacker has access to PMs. I doubt many people disclose their address, social security information etc. through this but it would be common practice in many subreddits to reveal much personal information such as name (especially for facebook), email address (might be different to account one too), mobile number, and username to many social media accounts... the dating subs will likely contain age and gender in the title anyhow, but they are likely to give away more detailed location, information about sexual orientation, disabilities, employer etc.

Reddit doesn't appear to care about data security and this is likely to be a heavy fine from the EU.

2) You were hacked (again) and

**GDPR Article 33 -  Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority:**

 1.  In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, **not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority** competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. 

**GDPR Article 34** \-  **Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject:**

 1.  When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject **without undue delay.** 

So in reference to the 72 hours notification, they are only required to notify the supervisory authority in that time. For the data subject, the language is intentionally vague, only ""without undue delay"". There are also several clauses for with exceptions can be granted, for example when the information is encrypted.

In regards to the GDPR compliance officer, I assume you mean the data protection officer? In which case the GDPR has made it mandatory to have one only when they meet three specific criteria: 1. they are a public authority, 2. their core activity is processing of and monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, 3. processing on a large scale of special data per article 9. I am not sure if Reddit is required to have a DPO and if they do who that person is.

The algorithm used in 2007 is known - it was [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) and is available to pretty much anyone that can write code https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.sha1(v=vs.110).aspx (damn you MS for putting parenthesis in your links and blowing up my markdown).  You don't need to reverse engineer the algorithm, its [publicly known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#SHA-1_pseudocode).  There are weaknesses to using a hashed password, such as the same input string will always generate the same output string.  This is where the salting comes into play, adding a random string of text to the password beginning/end and then generating a hash.  This means that when I create the password Hunter2, it would give a different hash than if you also used the password Hunter2 as we have unique salts applied to the password.

>Notified users immediately of compromised data

See, that's the part that takes time.  Had Reddit came out and said, we've detected an intrusion into our systems.  We have no idea how they got in, what they saw, who they compromised, what they changed - how would that have gone over?  It would have been mayhem in the user base.  A detailed announcement with facts is how this should be handled to prevent mass hysteria.  

With that said, take simple precautions against your online persona.  Don't use the same passwords on multiple sites.  Change your passwords every so often.  Rather than short and complex passwords, use long passwords ([an XKCD for everything](https://www.xkcd.com/936/)).  Use 2FA whenever offered but not the SMS version as its almost as insecure as not having 2FA is someone really wants into your account (as proven by this Reddit post).",False,False,1533163058.0,15899,971,1373984614.0,False,True

I had a little trouble figuring out how to report the data leak. I searched Reddit support and was directed to a lot of self-help sections (understandable given Reddit's size.)

In the thread, some users speculated that the email itself wasn't genuine. (Looked real to me, though.)

So I replied to the email, and got three replies, one of which said that I'd reached redditads outside of business hours and another of which said that replies to that email address weren't monitored.

Well, Captain Happy, two things. First you didn't. I know this because the NSA doesn't *have* servers that are internet-accessible besides its web servers that contain absolutely nothing of value. But you know, good for you jumping the air gap with your 31337 skillz. Even if you did, the NSA's security doesn't fall apart just because you got root... again, something you'd know if you'd read the rainbow books (you *have* read them, right?). In fact, it gets you almost nothing. 


Second, why do you have to be so uncompromisingly inferior in interpersonal relationships? I get spending all your time hacking can make someone a little, achem, eccentric. I know it from experience. But it didn't turn me into a raging douche-bag like you.


> It's not magic. It's talent and sweat. 


And skill means nothing if you can't work well with others. Which is possibly why nobody *wants* to touch you. Just because IT is more of a meritocracy than most fields doesn't mean you can be such a dick. There are a few examples of assholes who made it anyway -- Steve Jobs, for example. But the overwhelming majority are stuck in server rooms, the purgatory of promotions, so nobody has to deal with their whiny ass. 


I'd take someone who *majored* in gender studies and runs around singing in a pink tutu over your sorry ass. At least *they* can be taught something. You're an expert -- and that's not a compliment. Experts can't learn anything new, and clearly with an attitude like yours you haven't learned a goddamn thing of value in some time. 


Let me tell you something about ***REAL*** hackers: The better they are, the *more* likely they are to have interests outside of computers in which they are more than merely proficient. And if you're even a tenth as good as you're posing, you'd know all this. ""what the fuck you do"" is be an irritating piece of shit, and I wouldn't hire you regardless of qualifications, because you're utterly insufferable. I can take someone with ""good enough"" skill that won't be an asshole to my other employees -- there's plenty of those.

I got fired from a really awesome Trust and Safety role because I had the audacity to suggest that we might have to inform customers of the significant data breach I just spent 12 after work hours assessing. 

This is after one of our Bug Bounty folks had discovered it as a security vulnerability six weeks prior, and when brought to the CEO, was like “eh, we will deal with it next cycle” (and then it got pushed back again, surprise)

The vulnerability point? The CEOs own pet project to do super basic SMS stuff, except forcing it on everyone as a mandatory requirement, which meant a host of folks would use free SMS sites, etc. 

* We never informed the user we would store that number
* We never informed the user that the number could be used to access the account

CEO, pissed that I took a shit in his pond (sorry, I’m Australian), Got the person who hired me, and lead training of me, to fire me (note: she was not HR). Spent half my exit interview calming her down, stopping her from crying, telling her how awesome a job she’d been doing. 

She was only staying on because her partner (who was related to the CEO, yay, nepotism) was entrenched there. I pointed out the multiple times the CEO had verbally berated and abused her partner. Two months later find out they both walked, and took half the staff with them. 

But the real kicker? Despite me finding tonnes of affected accounts, that had been ghosted by these people (logging in as you, monitoring all your private comms, gaining your pass), no one was notified, the fix silently applied, and just never spoken of again.

As you can't re-hash a password once hashed, as you don't have the cleartext, there's two methods for handling this. The first is to wrap the hash with another, stronger, hash and then prepend the original salt. The other method, which Reddit chose, is to simply rehash the password **when the user logged in**, as they would have the cleartext at that point. It's the cheaper method, and simpler with a massive user base, though relies on activity to maintain security and has a long tail for updates. 

What this means, is that only users who logged in had their passwords rehashed. Not all users.

compare\_password is a string containing the hash prefixed by the salt. In this stanza, they are simply grabbing the first three chars.

They do use a homegrown constant time comparison method as they were running Python < 2.7. It's detailed here, and while I haven't looked at it in depth, I don't see any glaring issues.

It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.Since 2005 SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents, and since 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement by SHA-2 or SHA-3. Microsoft, Google, Apple and Mozilla have all announced that their respective browsers will stop accepting SHA-1 SSL certificates by 2017.In 2017 CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash.

When there’s a breach involving “accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed,” then IT groups will need to analyze whether the exposed or affected EU personal data identifiers can cause “risk to the rights and freedoms” of EU data subjects.

Some companies refuse to notify users even after such an investigation, even though it's the law!

To go off half cocked and release a statement BEFORE an investigation has finished is harmful to the company, and doesn't help because the full scope, impact, and what is required to fix it is only completely known after a full investigation. 

It'd be really stupid if you released a statement saying the attackers breached your companies payment infrastructure, only to conduct your due diligence after and find that that access was NOT malicious but a normal day to day behavior of the victim, that would do more damage than waiting a few months until you knew exactly what happened! Or, an employee could be acting as an inside contact (which happens often enough that it's a normal concern), and again you don't want to tip them off before you figure out who it was!

Plus then the security guys would most likely lose their jobs for being completely incompetent.   


Also, I do know that in some cases companies have the ability or hire third parties that are able to gather more information on the attackers by leaving a backdoor in the system and watching what the attackers do!

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

A hash is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input of any length and returns an output of fixed length. It's not reversible - you cannot get the original data from the output hash.

So if your password is `sparkles` and they are using a hash function such as `sha256`, the result would be `DD368CC7BBFB278C3B17F162AFA0D1BC6BC5AFD233B1D4E6E327FF790E8AD205`. You can see various results for this *particular* hash function using an online tool such as [this](https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/).

It's impossible to get the original password back from the hash string. But, if I store the hash string, I can check that you have the right password easily by hashing the password you give me in the same manner and comparing its hash with the hash I have stored since the hashes will always be the same for any given input.

The reason that it's a big deal that the hashes were leaked is that even though hash functions are irreversible, some hash functions are better than others when it comes to password storage. Hash functions that are really fast can suffer from ""brute force"" attacks for weak passwords where basically someone tries every possible password combination until they match the hash, at which point they know what the password is.

There are two ways to combat this. First, using a hash function that is slower means it takes much, much longer to brute force. Unfortunately, the 2007 Reddit database is using `sha1` which is both weak (compared to modern functions) and fast.

But, they did employ the other major technique, known as salting. If I have a big list of hashes and I'm brute forcing, what I would ideally want to do is hash my guessed password once and check it against my entire list of hashes to see if it matches any of them. With salting, what you do is add a randomized string to the password *before* you hash it and then you store that randomized string along with the hash. So, given our previous example, if your password was `sparkles` my password storage code might generate the random string `foobar` and thus the string it would hash is `foobarsparkles` giving me a sha256 hash of `5332EB14BE03DD9FD18570EF8A930AC027F3BB9730220C945AAC8B9E6746DCA2` which is different than the hash for just `sparkles` alone.

Now, since I've stored both the random string and the hash of the string + password, I can still check that you know the password by taking your password, adding the random string to it that I've stored, hashing it, and then comparing that hash to the original hash I stored. But, since every user's password has its own unique salt, I can't brute force the entire database at once. I can only brute force one user at a time, using their unique random salt.

**tl;dr** No, sorry. But, it's still potentially a big deal that they leaked.",False,False,False,120414,2609,1246613631.0,False,True

Only corporations based within the EU are subject to provide such rights to their members located WITHIN the EU, not out of it. Companies that operate within the sphere of the EU can (such as Reddit)-- out of convenience-- provide all of its users such rights, but there is no American based company that has to give US users any such rights under GPDR. It is not US-based regulations.

https://www.wired.com/story/how-gdpr-affects-you/: ""People in the United States aren’t entitled to the same rights or protections—but that doesn’t mean people outside of the EU should ignore GDPR completely."" This is because they are not just US based, so many companies will just update their policies rather than differentiate based on location. If Reddit wants to, fine, but it does not have to.

https://www.google.com/search?q=united+states+gdpr&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1-ab: ""Now, US multinationals will need to update their US privacy incident-response playbook in at least 10 areas in order to be ready for the GDPR’s May 2018 compliance deadline."" This is because they are not just US based, not because US citizens are permitted the same rights, which was addressed previously. Americans simply are not entitled to these rights just because a company decides to allow EU members access. In the US, we follow US based laws. Thus, there is no obligation.

http://www.govtech.com/analysis/GDPR-in-the-US-Be-Careful-What-You-Wish-For.html: ""The current attention on the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal has caused numerous commentators to suggest that the United States should adopt a law modeled after the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into effect on May 25, 2018."" This means that it is not officially adopted in the US for all US only based companies, but it could be for all companies if there are regulations put into effect, which I doubt that there will be. 

""Before explaining in more detail what GDPR compliance really entails, it is worth recounting the different approaches to data privacy that have developed in the U.S. and EU. The biggest major difference is that to date, outside of some heavily regulated industries, such as health care and banking, the U.S. does not have generally applicable privacy regulations."" Again, they are different. US companies, in procedure, must only follow GDPR in the EU. In practice, it is just easier to update the whole policy rather than keeping different regulations for EU and non-EU states.

""I won't beat around the bush. I know that **** is your password. Most importantly, I am aware about your secret and I've proof of it. You don't know me and no one paid me to look into you. 

It is just your bad luck that I stumbled across your blunder. The truth is, I setup a malware on the adult videos (porn material) and you visited this web site to have fun (you know what I mean). When you were watching video clips, your internet browser began working as a Rdp (Remote desktop) having a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your display and webcam. Immediately after that, my software program collected all your contacts from your facebook, as well as mailbox. 

After that I gave in more time than I probably should've investigating into your life and created a two view video. First part displays the recording you had been watching and 2nd part shows the recording of your cam (its you doing inappropriate things). 

Frankly, I'm ready to forget all information about you and let you get on with your daily life. And I am going to offer you 2 options that may accomplish that. The two choices either to ignore this letter, or simply pay me $ 2900. Let us understand those 2 options in more detail. 

Option 1 is to ignore this e mail. You should know what will happen if you select this option. I will definitely send out your video recording to your contacts including relatives, colleagues, and many others. It does not protect you from the humiliation you and your family will ought to feel when family and friends discover your dirty videos from me. 

Second Option is to send me $ 2900. We’ll call this my “privacy charges”. Here is what will happen if you choose this choice. Your secret will remain your secret. I will delete the recording immediately. You keep your routine life that none of this ever occurred. 

At this point you must be thinking, “I will complain to the police”. Without a doubt, I've taken steps in order that this mail cannot be traced time for me and yes it will not stay away from the evidence from destroying your life. I'm not trying to dig a hole in your pocket. I just want to be paid for the time I placed into investigating you. Let's assume you have decided to generate this all go away and pay me the confidentiality fee. You will make the payment through Bitcoins (if you do not know how, type ""how to buy bitcoins"" on google search) 

Amount to be sent: $ 2900 
Bitcoin Address to Send: 19Fa6gdfYyx*1Dkz3vHKG8h169PTyp89ksK ( You must Delete * from this string then copy and paste it carefully) 

Expalin no one what will you be using the Bitcoins for or they might not sell it to you. The process to have bitcoin usually takes a couple of days so do not procrastinate.
I have a specific pixel within this email, and at this moment I know that you've read through this email message. You now have 24 hours in order to make the payment. If I don't receive the Bitcoin, I will certainly send your video recording to your entire contacts including members of your family, colleagues, and so forth. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Having said that, if I do get paid, I will destroy the recording immediately. It's a non negotiable offer, so please do not waste my personal time & yours. Your time has started. You should be aware that my software will definitely be tracking what action you adopt when you're done looking over this email. To be honest, If I see any wanna-be smart activity from your browser history then let me send out your sextape to your close relatives, co-workers even before your deadline.""

A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a password (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a space–time tradeoff, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple lookup table with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation function that employs a salt makes this attack infeasible.

Nope. A ton of malware is installed via compromised ad networks which never touch the actual porn servers at all. Or, a man in the middle attack. Either way, the porn site may be completely ignorant of what's happening. Also, porn vendors also may not have much inhouse expertise to detect attacks. 

> on a user’s favorite porn site(s)

Again, that's not how it works.

So the way it would work is to compromise a computer first, then gain more access on that computer, then find out who it is, and then exploit them. It's like spam: send out a million compromised ads, and then see who you catch. 

I agree that it's unlikely that ordinary porn users would not usually be attacked this way. But it has happened to more high value targets. It is possible.

Positive Technologies was able to hijack the text messages using its own research tool, which exploits weaknesses in the cellular network to intercept text messages in transit. Known as the SS7 network, that network is shared by every telecom to manage calls and texts between phone numbers. There are a number of known SS7 vulnerabilities, and while access to the SS7 network is theoretically restricted to telecom companies, hijacking services are frequently available on criminal marketplaces.

> Even if a third-party service isn’t available, Positive Technologies researchers say they may simply attack the network directly. “It's much easier and cheaper to get direct access to the SS7 interconnection network and then craft specific SS7 messages, instead of trying to find a ready-to-use SS7 hijack service,” the researchers told The Verge.

Shit hasn't changed at all. Still fighting an uphill battle. 

And then another prospective client, we've sold their security team on the tool, and the cost is reasonable, but their finance division was told to cut costs, so they're considering professional services (cheaper, but don't do what security actually NEEDS) rather than actually spend on the tools.

Outrage. I don't know if you know how likely breaches are. Statistically speaking, they're almost unavoidable in one form or the other once you're big enough.

Modern security standards dictate that an organization always store and use the hash of your password, and not the password itself. When you type in your password, it's hashed and then that result is checked against the database to confirm it.

The problem is that hashes aren't perfect, so there could be something called a collision, where two different inputs result in the same output.

To give an example, if your password is hunter2, the MD5 hash would be 
2ab96390c7dbe3439de74d0c9b0b1767. Now, MD5, is not secure, so a hacker could take that output and find a different password that has the same hash value.

Since the database only stores the hash, someone could theoretically log in to your account with a totally different password, as long as the hash output is the same.

Ended up taking the Sec+ exam in 2016 to meet that DoD Directive 8570, then I hit up a recruiter in my area to try to find a job. The recruiter thing didn't pan out, but only because I've been doing university part time and had some schedule restrictions.

>Is it at all possible to avoid call center work when getting into IT?

With no prior IT experience? Probably not, unfortunately. I ended up getting a job with a small, local ISP in my city. I am doing help desk stuff, fielding calls and walking people through plugging a router in to a wall jack. But it's small enough of a company that I get exposed to a whole ton of shit I wouldn't be if I was in a typical help desk role. After this coming semester I'll be moving over to work with the Networking guys.

The Sec+/DoD 8570 means that you're a good candidate for entry level help desk stuff for government contractors that support the DoD. You'd have to get it in the first few months of employment anyway, so already having it is a kind of insurance for the employer, they know their time training you won't be a waste if you fail it. My plan was to get the Sec+, look for jobs, and continue on studying for/taking the Net+, then do the CCNA Routing and Switching. There are a lot of DoD installations near me though, so ymmv on that.

If you learn things on your own anyway, take a call center type job if you have to. The absolute fucking second you stop learning things you didn't know about networking, or whatever direction you want to move towards, then hit up a recruiter or start applying at other places. Call centers are a necessary evil if you don't already have experience or luck out in the hiring process, so take what you can from it, fill out the resume, and don't ever allow yourself to become complacent. Whether it's in a call center, an oil rig, Afghanistan, or just walking down the street, complacency fucking kills. Ultimately, if your job now isn't in IT, what do you think would look better on a resume? A+/Net+/Sec+ and your current work experience, or A+/one other cert and even tangentially related work experience? As a bonus a menial call center might still be willing to pay for you to sit some of those exams.

There are some situations where they'd be required to step back and call in the authorities, but usually the information security team (if the company has one, or hires a third party company to figure out what is going on) is responsible for attempting to determine who attacked them, in addition to how the attackers got in, what they did, and what they removed from the company. However many companies do not have groups that can do all of this internally. Some do, especially the big banks because they have to abide by so many laws and have so much at risk, but it can be a crapshoot sometimes with other companies!

I've read writeups done a while after the fact where a company's security team will post the technical details of the breach/incident and their findings for other infosec professionals to look into (/r/netsec and /r/malware sometimes links to these) where they were able to determine what data was exfiltrated, and what group was suspected as being responsible! It can be difficult though, as many attackers will first breach a system on the internet to stage their attack, and of course proxies and such are used often. Many times the system that actually breaches a company will be a system that was attacked and powned to be specifically used!

One of the most notable cases of this is when attackers breached multiple university systems across America, then launched an attack campaign against some news sites, IIRC. I think it was a few years ago, I want to say against the New York Times, but I cannot find any articles on it. I will post them once I do!

The attackers use his computer to gain access into the user database for the company's customers, and promptly makes off with data! Security realizes that data was ex-filtrated, but their systems were not setup in such a way as to they knew the full impact immediately (this is common).

So the security guys begin their investigation. They decide that since they knew the computer was breached on the 5th of that month, they don't need to look at any previous days. During their investigation, they see hundreds of connections to the customer payment processing systems! UH OH! They quickly call the CEO, and tell him the payment processing infrastructure was accessed by the attackers and data was moved off the servers.

Once this happens, legal has to be notified, as do the authorities as per Federal Law. Certain mechanisms now are moving, including federal agents coming on site to do their own investigation. The CEO then must go to the board, and informs them of this horrific breach. The company then has to release a full public statement, and pay for credit monitoring services for all their customers, which turns out to be over 1 million people.

But what the (incompetent or overworked) security guys failed to figure out because they didn't do their due diligence, was that User A's secondary job duties require him to upload and download data and reports from the payroll system, every Thursday of the week. What they saw, and didn't dig into enough, was a normal communication, part of this employees normal job, but not his main job.

So after the company pays millions, losing many many customers, and is now considered ""too risky to do business with"" forcing them into the red and their stock to plummet, the FBI finishes their investigation and provides the report to the board and the CEO.

The report correctly notes that ONLY the customer database was breached, copied, and that data was exfiltrated. The report notes that despite the security personnel's conclusions, there was no malicious access to the payment processing infrastructure, because the FBI agents did their due diligence and realized what was going on.

So now the company is blacklisted, basically, the security guys are fired, and the company has to lay off workers and dig deeeep into their savings to ensure they will still be functioning in a year. The CEO is fired, and the board has to find a new CEO. Nobody gets a bonus, and the company has to go through a lengthy process to get back some of the funds they already started paying out to credit monitoring services.

If they had waited until both investigations were finished, this would've been caught, and the company would not be in freefall due to someone going off half-cocked and not waiting for the investigation to be finished, and a third party to do their own investigation (in this case the FBI, but sometimes companies are able to just hire a security company to do an independent review).

Rainbow Tables are basically huge sets of precomputed tables filled with hash values that are pre-matched to possible plaintext passwords. The Rainbow Tables essentially allow hackers to reverse the hashing function to determine what the plaintext password might be.

The plaintext password may not even be the same password that was created by the user, but as long as the hash is matched, then it doesn't matter what the original password was.

Beyond that, how do you determine beyond any reasonable doubt when it is tampering and not just some idiot ranting in an echo chamber of a subreddit? Of course they should be banned when breaking Reddit rules, but fake news is nearly inseparable from idiocy and that doesn't violate the rules.

So, Reddit didn't have direct control over the security policies of Company X or whoever else Company X is working with to provide services to Reddit. Reddit probably asked them to change the policy before so that it would be more secure, but Company X said they couldn't disable the text message reset because of their Company X policy.

Now that Reddit has had a significant data breach they went back to Company X and said, ""Listen, you either disable this shit or we're moving our business to another company."" And presumably either Company X agree and disable the text-message stuff, or they refused and Reddit changed who they're working with to Company Y instead.",False,False,False,71154,250,1401773823.0,False,True

Essentially, this means that rather than storing and using the password itself for your security, you can create and and use hashes to make identifiable, readable, and consistent 'password' strings, without making the password itself readable and therefore insecure.

Salting is an additional step where you add some additional characters to the end of the password BEFORE it is hashed, which means that even if you can guess the users password, you'd also have to guess the salt to arrive at the correct hash.

Finally, that asterisk on the non-reversible is there because older hashing algorithms use a set of known outputs that is large enough for someone to consider it secure, but is small enough that with modern computing hardware you can compute every known hash for almost any given input. This produces what is known as a 'rainbow table', a lookup table that is many gigabytes in size that allows attackers to infer a password from its hashed form without much computing power at all. Salting goes some way to prevent this, but really the best thing to do is use an up to date, state of the art algorithm.

Hashing means using a function that processes your password before storing it, so if somebody gets the list of passwords, they will see random characters, instead of `hunter2`. These hashing functions don't have a reverse function, so there is no way that you can unhash the password.

If the passwords are not salted before they are hashed, all users with the same password will have the same hash, so if you break one you'll know the password for all those users. There's also tables of the hashes for the most common passwords, these can only be used if the passwords weren't salted.

When your password is salted with a unique value and then hashed, it can still be cracked, and from what I've heard today, storing the salt along with the password is common practice. The longer your password is, the longer it'll take for it to be cracked, so long passwords are a lot more secure than adding numbers, uppercase letters and special characters.

Given the hash, it should be impossible to recover the password without brute Force (trying everything). Sites store hashed passwords so that, even if there's a data breach, it should be infeasible for the attacker to get user passwords. When you log in, it hashes the password  you entered and compares it to the hash in the database. One problem with this strategy is the possibility of collisions (two values with the same hash) due to a weak algorithm (see https://shattered.io). Also, people create rainbow tables: they take lists of common passwords and hash every one. Then, when there is a database breach, they look for hashes in the rainbow table, because they know which password produced those hashes. Salting is a strategy to reduce the risk from rainbow tables.

SHA-1 hashes things the same way each time, that's the purpose of an algorithm right?

You can then use programs to compare the encrypted hash to hashes in the table. When it finds a match, you know what the password is.

For example, using the algorithm CRC32, ""password"" becomes ""35C246D5"".

A salt is a string that's added to passwords to make this more secure. If you want, you can generate a table to turn hashes back into passwords, but you can only do this up to a certain length—after that, there are just too many possibilities to compute. A salt solves this issue because you can generate it randomly when the user sets their password and store it with the password, thus making the actual value used to calculate the hash much longer. As another example, say the random salt is ""12345"". Adding this to ""password"" gets ""password12345"", whoch hashes to ""04854D4C"".

In the real world, both the salt and the resulting hash are much longer, basically a minimum of 32 characters for the hash and a similarly long salt, which means that even with a bad hash algorithm it's much harder to turn the hashes back into passwords.

Rainbow tables are powerful because you can attack multiple users’ passwords at the same time.

At this point each entry in rainbow table is specific to an individual user, but let’s work through an example. 

The salt salt is short, sure, so that’s only 17k possible combinations. And say that we’re attaching a specific user from the 2007 database to keep things even more simple. We’re fairly sure that this user has a common password so let’s say it’s in one of the most 10k common passwords (real wordlists are millions of lines long). That’s 175 million possibilities. That you’d need to pre-generate. That are useless if you’re attacking any other user.

The spread of misinformation can also clearly lead to bad outcomes though, so it's at the very least something that I think big social platforms should be discussing.

Personally I'm more in favour of banning content from being shared (from known BS conspiracy sites etc) over banning users and their comments.

Reddit has an additional botting problem with regards to upvotes which is different than censorship. Reddit is supposed to be community driven and it should be clear that any system that allows an individual or a group of individuals to have an outsized say in what the community does/doesn't see is an issue worth addressing.

And while most people are immediately going to jump to political stuff with this, that's far from the only instance. There's a lot of strong evidence that corporations pay for vote manipulation for marketing/PR purposes.

In moral philosophy, deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek δέον, deon, ""obligation, duty"")

is the normative ethical position that judges the morality of an action based on rules.It is sometimes described as ""duty-"" or ""obligation-"" or ""rule-"" based ethics, because rules ""bind you to your duty"". Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to consequentialism, virtue ethics, and pragmatic ethics. In this terminology, action is more important than the consequences.

The term deontological was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by C. D. Broad in his book, Five Types of Ethical Theory, which was published in 1930.

***

**Utilitarianism**

Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that states that the best action is the one that maximizes utility. ""Utility"" is defined in various ways, usually in terms of the well-being of sentient entities. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as the sum of all pleasure that results from an action, minus the suffering of anyone involved in the action. Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong.

It is a practical example of a space–time tradeoff, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple lookup table with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation function that employs a salt makes this attack infeasible.

I don't think this is exactly right. Salts are usually randomized for each user and stored in the database right alongside the hashed password. If you can get to the hashed password, you can get to the salt, so there's no guesswork involved. The actual purpose of salting, by my understanding, is to render rainbow tables useless. Given the password 'hunter2' and an unsalted database, you can take the hash, no matter the algorithm, punch it into a reverse hash lookup site, or possibly even Google, and out pops 'hunter2'. Given a database dump of 1,000,000 users including email addresses and passwords, you can dump everything into a pivot table and find all of the most common passwords and all of the users that share them and then you've owned thousands of people at once (if they're using a common or simple password, they're probably using it for everything). If you throw a randomized six-character salt on the end of every password, even if the salt is stored in the same database, you are forcing the attacker to individually brute force every single entry that they want the password for, which greatly reduces the reward for stealing your database and also further protects your users in the event of a beach.",False,False,False,78291,9066,1294598082.0,False,True

In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that ""hashes"" data, a password or passphrase. Salts are closely related to the concept of nonce. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks or against its hashed equivalent, a pre-computed rainbow table attack.Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system.

But I follow best practices for my accounts, so even if someone takes my credentials and dumps them online, or tries to use them, they won't be able to get into my email account using the password I used for my Reddit account, nor use my email and this PW to attempt access into other third party accounts. It gives me peace of mind regarding my more sensitive accounts like my email account, or banking accounts, etc. 

On Reddit, the wealth of personal information that they have on me is all publicly available if someone knows my username, as it's all information I've posted in comments. They would get very little from breaking into my account.

If the breach included say, their payment processor tie ins that are what allows us to buy Reddit Gold with a credit card, I'd hope the laws would mandate a quicker notification time for us, since even though I don't have it remember that information, it's still pretty sensitive and I'd prefer to deal with it quicker.   


I'm currently happy in the sense that Reddit did follow all the applicable laws, and notified us after they were sure a breach occurred. As I've mentioned before, other companies don't even abide by these laws, or are incorporated in states that do not have such stringent requirements for notifications. 

In a perfect world, we would be notified immediately the second they discovered the breach so we can act upon it. But that's not the case, unfortunately. In a world with companies like Equifax (remember, there are 2 other companies that do exactly what they do, and probably do not do much more to protect your data than Equifax does) and a president who has relaxed laws that are supposed to punish companies who fail to protect their customers and such, preventing any such enforcement from being properly functional, I'd say this is as good as we're going to get for the time being, at least in America. Maybe as the time goes on GDPR will enforce quicker breach notifications. We can hope! But for now, Reddit has done what they are supposed to have done, and that's enough for the time being.

Unlike if they just use that password and have no secondary form. This is a well-documented problem and has existed for decades.

You using a password manager (me too!) doesn't mean everyone is. The bulk of users do not, and still use weak passwords to this day. It's basically ""0FA"" in that sense. But even if you use a strong password, that is not enough.

Now that we've established that yes, you should be using 2FA, and ""I use strong passwords"" is not sufficient, let's address your list of 2FA woes:

1. Recovery codes! They exist exactly for exceptional situations like ""I lost my phone / my phone died"" etc. If you're losing your phone constantly, that's your fault. But I've yet to find a site or service that utilizes 2FA that completely locks you out. Please provide these sites that do this to you. Every site / service I've seen has had some form of recovery codes or mechanism to get back in should you lose your 2nd factor in some way.
2. You don't need mobile data to use 2FA on your mobile device. HOTP/TOTP is all offline, and SMS will use your phone network. If you have no signal that'd be another thing for SMS, but HOTP/TOTP is unaffected. But also: In what scenario are you traveling (1) without your phone and (2) where you are logging in to a site or something? I'd love to know where you have no phone signal but have internet access.
3. If you are in a locked-down environment, why are you logging in to web sites or services not related to said environment? If you're at work and need to log in somewhere that's not work related, I don't know what to tell you. If you're at work and you need to log in somewhere that's work-related, then you need to suss that out with your employer. Any competent place will allow you to utilize 2FA (it's offline-capable -- see point 2) if you have such a requirement.
4. You can use authenticator applications on your computer. Authy and Google Authenticator both support this. If you're on a device and need to login somewhere, you can use said device as your 2nd factor as much as a phone. No phone required.
5. While financial / medical institutions are indeed a top priority for such things, that in no way means other sites should *not* be using them. And ""not every site is on board with 2FA yet"" is not a reason for why 2FA is inferior. How would it be?",False,False,False,1014035,7567,1369428562.0,False,True

Ahh yes,  the every naive ""when done properly"".  

How many times have there been massive news stories about AWS accounts being compromised?  

I will concede that AWS is less prone to Social Engineering Attacks simply because AWS has almost none existent customer service of the type that would be prone to such things

However it is ignorant to believe that ""providers""  only applies to PaaS cloud vendors that have little to customer service

Even if you are using AWS for much of your solution I am sure you are at some point connecting customer data to 3rd parties be it a Credit Card processor, or some other service which likely does not have such security policies

> The federal government has even started secure intelligence agency data, and the nations IRS data in the AWS cloud

lol...  that is suppose to be proof of something?  How much NSA data has been stolen in the last few years again?

How much data from other government agency has been leaked, stolen, or other wise compromised?  

No stating the ""federal government uses them so they must be secure"" is not a valid defense...  sorry

>and the nations IRS data in the AWS cloud

and That is terrifying.  IRS is routinely defrauded by people so once again IRS has proven to have poor security practices  so not really something you want to hold up as proof of security 

<<rant>> ohh sure they continue the false narrative of ""Identity Theft"" being the problem, but no one has their Identity Stolen.  Companies and governments are defrauded because they have lack security requirements.  If someone opens an account in my name, or files a tax return in my name that is not me,  my identity was not stolen  they are defrauded...  This concept of Identity Fraud vs Identity Theft is some what of a pet peeve of mine but that was a diversion from the topic.  <<//rant>>

>you are screwed. 

That is pretty much all you needed.  Trusting any of these companies with data means you are screwed...  

My entire point in my comment is people are not as secure as they think they are.  Further this trend to put massive levels of trust in big cloud providers like AWS, MS, Google, etc is prone for a massive failure....  Personally I think it is a house of cards that will collapse 

We seemingly have lost the first principle in data security....  which is Data Minimization.  Only keep what you have to...  It if not present it can not be stolen...

- Hashes do not compress. At all.

and i always love the irony of defending antifa/blm by calling those that oppose them fascist.  because what they do is literally fascist. trying to shut down all opposing viewpoints.  they march around shouting everyone they dont agree with down, often resorting to violence, and you call me a fascist for calling them out?  im not even saying they cant march around chanting whatever they want. yet im apparently the fascist for wanting free speech without violence.  sure.  you must be highly educated.

Again, does not help if traveling.

The point is this: **you always need your phone for 2FA**. Yes, there are clunky backup codes (assuming you are carrying them with you), and yes, if you are at home and set up in advance you might not need a code. But do you really think that the person with ""password"" as his password is going to have a backup password ready to fix their 2FA authentication? Let's get real here, there is *no* scenario where a person who is computer illiterate figures out how to get Google Authenticator working properly, let alone prints out backup codes.

I agree there's a problem with trusting the regulators, I'm just not sure that's a bigger problem than what we currently face.

Oh, you post here to educate people? Here's something that you clearly haven't learned: Contrarianism for its own sake is ridiculous and just as bad as going with the majority mindlessly. I, like most people, form opinions based on what I like personally. I don't like Game of Thrones, it's too violent and has a lot of content I'm not a fan of. I don't like most comedy shows I've seen because the jokes feel stale, recycled, and lazy. I don't like Rick and Morty because the constant low-class humor detracts from a promising show in my opinion. But I also love Gravity Falls, I enjoy Silicon Valley, and despite the content I'm not a fan of, I think Black Mirror is a fantastic piece of work. I like some stuff that's popular, and dislike some stuff that's popular. You know why that is? Because I'm an individual. And I form my OWN opinions on shit.

Now, you're over here preaching about ANYTHING the majority likes being bad. Good for you! I'm glad you feel that way. But maybe, just maybe, instead of being a self-righteous, superior, condescending, contrarian, arrogant asshole, you could try thinking for yourself sometimes. Go on, it's not hard! Start by ignoring whether the majority of people like something or not and try it for yourself.

On the other hand, that requires thought. And you've demonstrated consistently in this comment thread that you aren't capable of such. You made a comment that overreacted to a joke, you were called out on missing the joke, you doubled down, people pointed out that you missed the point of the joke even though you acknowledged it was a quote, and then you changed the discussion topic completely to dodge having to accept that you were wrong, at which point you ranted about how much better you are than everyone else because... you let the majority choose your opinions, but in reverse? I guess?

Fuck outta here, honey. I started out being cordial and you doubled down on your shitty attitude. And now, I'm not gonna deal with your shit anymore. Have a good life. I hope you figure out how to interact with people like a normal human being.

Look, I'm sure you're a good person and you're typically nice. You just reeeeally need to take a look at yourself in this thread and realize that you've consistently acted like a toxic, self-obsessed douche. And, yeah. People have responded pretty rudely to you, myself included, but let's be perfectly clear and point out that those responses came only after you started being a jerk. Maybe you should take this as a sign that you should really act like a better person if you expect people to respond politely to you.

If you shut it down one of two things occur: One - they start up a new subreddit with basically the same content. Two - that content get's plastered in other subreddits and it puts work on other people.

So what is the other option? The answer: Subtle manipulation. And by this I mean - find some way to determine likely bot activity (a few ways to do this, but let's leave it at - it can be done). Now take % of active users in subreddits (I dunno what you would consider active) and weight every post based on this with some method of shaping the weighting so that the occassional post shows up - but it becomes far less frequent.

People who want to consume T\_D content are free to do so. But it's influence overall drops off without ever having to ban it, or call it out.

And when people ask questions ""We found that foreign botting accounts were being used. We have come up with a few solutions in adjusting how our algorithms work at detecting such activity to dissuade the use of automated tools in manipulating the conversations around politically charged movements so the US public can have honest discourse with less concern of false information being rapidly spread through our platform"".

See - you can even make it sound patriotic.

In social psychology, group polarization refers to the tendency for a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. These more extreme decisions are towards greater risk if individuals' initial tendencies are to be risky and towards greater caution if individuals' initial tendencies are to be cautious. The phenomenon also holds that a group's attitude toward a situation may change in the sense that the individuals' initial attitudes have strengthened and intensified after group discussion, a phenomenon known as attitude polarization.

We here in this United States of America are all about freedom, and fucking Eagles and shit, and those gosh darn commies and their gosh darn Kally Shakanova Assault Rifles ain't got nothing on high quality American plastic.

And there we also go, a Russian apologist in addition to a fascist piece of shit. Do you want to just go ahead and own up to being a white nationalist as well? Because based on how you've literally doubled back on everything else you've projected, I'm assuming that's next. Go ahead, tell me about how your ethnostate idea makes so much sense despite all of science proving you wrong on every single level imaginable, and that your little ethnostate would create an inbred cesspool of white disease, like what has literally happened with Russia.

I'm clearly trying to poison the youth with my stupid free speech and disagreement of you and your extremist bat shit viewpoints. How dare I not conform.

Rights to free speech guarantee that you won't be prosecuted by the government. It does not give you freedom from being called a fascist pussy snowflake when you're being a fascist, pussy, small-dicked, limp-wristed, gun fetishizing, white supremacist, Russia-loving snowflake. So you're not Hilter, you're just Mussolini. You're too much of a coward to be someone like Hitler. You're too afraid of being disliked to commit to your viewpoints. Once your fascist leader is in prison (whether that's Trump or Putin), you'll go right back to pretending you don't believe in any of this shit, because you're a pussy snowflake that hides behind projection.

> Kettle, meet pot. No, no, not Pol Pot, Pot Pot.

This would work a lot better if you didn't immediately crack under the slightest bit of pressure and reveal yourself for what you were while I never concealed my beliefs or intentions. But that's generally to be expected when a fascist pussy snowflake such as yourself goes up against a man of principles.

You're *really* digging into the ""but what about this one little corner case"" thing now. But if you're planning on logging in to something on vacation like that (not sure why you would, but I'm sure there are valid examples), keep 'em on your person. And you can stop with the additional what-ifs (like ""what if I lose my codes too"") because you're talking incredibly small probabilities too.

Also, you said you use a password manager. What are you using for that while on vacation? If the answer is ""your phone"" you're equally boned...

Why do you not have your phone in either of those instances? And how do either of those qualify as ""places without mobile data""?

Name time! You were talking about a work environment before, but now you're talking about a non-work environment, that doesn't allow phones, but *does* allow use of the Internet? This I gotta see!

(But in those cases you can use your internet-accessing device as your 2nd auth, as mentioned later in the post).

> Again, does not help if traveling.

Neither does using a password manager... You're really reaching here, I think.

> The point is this: you always need your phone for 2FA.

You didn't read my whole post if you think that. That is incorrect.

> But do you really think that the person with ""password"" as his password is going to have a backup password ready to fix their 2FA authentication? 

I think that the scenarios you describe 2FA breaking down are incredibly niche and are inconveniences at worst. ""I lost my phone"" should absolutely not be a normal use case for users, and do not invalidate the efficacy of 2FA.

Please cite sources beyond ""it's inconvenient"" that show why 1FA is better. I notice that you did not respond to any of the multitude of sources I provided. Would you care to?

I also noticed you completely skipped over large chunks of my post in general. Particularly the refutation of your 5th point...

> Oh good, I was really worried about someone fraudulently using Joe Schmo's Quora account! I am glad it's a pain in the ass to log into all of my websites now, it was a worthy cause. 

The problem of users re-using passwords does not end at Joe's Quora account. They end at Joe's bank account, because Joe re-used his Quora password for his banking. This is kind of an Appeal to Ridicule fallacy anyway, but I digress.

In closing:

* ""You always need your phone for 2FA"" is demonstrably false
* ""But what if an exceptional case happens"" is exactly that: exceptional. No more exception (less-so, in fact) than ""what if I forget my password"" or ""what if I lose access to my password manager""
* 2FA is strictly better security-wise than 1FA. Yes, you have to make concessions like ""don't lose your smartphone"" and ""if you need access to a site while you're in a ""not-work, internet allowed but smartphone not allowed"" you have to plan ahead"", but that doesn't invalidate the benefits of using 2FA.

Privacy Shield is an agreement between the US and EU *that is completely optional for companies to be part of*.

Doing otherwise wouldn't really accomplish anything the salt doesn't already and wouldn't significantly lessen the time a cracking program would take to run once written.

> Also they're not fixed length I presume?

There is no reason they need to be. The purpose of the hash is only to make your ""hunter2"" password different from my ""hunter2"" password before it is encrypted. That way an attacked can't create their own account with password ""hunter2"", see what the resulting hash is, and know all accounts with the same hash have the same password.

Regardless of length of the salt, the resulting hash will be the same size and will have no relation to the no-salt hash or the same password hashed with different salts. You wouldn't want to restrict your salts to be so small that users are likely to use the same salts, however.

> Could one still produce a rainbow table from the hashes and remove the salt from these tables to guess the passwords? Tedious, but possible?

Rainbow tables are just a technique to store a lookup table of password guesses and the resulting hashes using less memory. The lookup table still needs to be created by guessing passwords and storing results (brute force). Even if amount of storage space isn't an issue, it is generally impractical to attempt every possible password.

Without salts, I can guess random passwords without being specific about which user I am guessing for. I find the hash for ""password"" and what do you know? 100,000 users have that password hash!

With salts, if user 1's salt was ""1:"" and it is added to the beginning of the password, I can guess passwords for user 1 by guessing ""1:password"", ""1:hunter2"", etc. While doing this, I will never stumble across a password for user 2, or any other user, since I am guessing specifically for user 1's salt.

In short, yes. Given infinite time you could create a rainbow table for all possible password and salt combinations and use it to lookup passwords and remove the salts. But salts make it so it is no faster than brute forcing each user's password individually.",False,False,False,31020,714,1377890236.0,False,True

Can you though? I think the evidence suggest otherwise. When you walk into a shrinks office, they don't say ""please don't tell me your dark thoughts because talking about them is dangerous"".

> The problem of users re-using passwords does not end at Joe's Quora account. They end at Joe's bank account, because Joe re-used his Quora password for his banking.

You are conflating two issues here. If Joe re-used his Quora password for banking, it doesn't matter whether Quora used 2FA or not.

I find it completely laughable that you think a realistic solution to security is ""carry your cell phone around with you at all times""

My entire argument is ""it's inconvenient,"" are you illiterate or something?

> I notice that you did not respond to any of the multitude of sources I provided. Would you care to?

Sure: none of those articles is peer reviewed or an official publication from any security-related organization, and therefore I reject them all as opinion, since apparently you decided that *you* are allowed to do that.

> ""You always need your phone for 2FA"" is demonstrably false

In practice it is true

> ""But what if an exceptional case happens"" is exactly that: exceptional. 

And those of us in tech know that exceptional things happen all the time and must be handled properly.

> No more exception (less-so, in fact) than ""what if I forget my password"" or ""what if I lose access to my password manager""

No, it is worse, because if you forget your password you can reset it.

> 2FA is strictly better security-wise than 1FA.

No debate there, I am simply arguing that in 95% of cases the benefits do not outweigh the drawbacks.

> If you wish to pursue this further, you will have to provide citations for your claims like ""1FA is better"" or ""2FA is so inconvenient it's detrimental to user security"". I will no longer reply to your opinions.

Problems in set NP are problems that are quickly checkable, if you are given the answer. If you are trying to crack a encrypted password, and someone tells you the password is ""hunter2"" it is quick to check if they are right - just try encrypting ""hunter2"" and see if it creates the same encrypted password. Thus cracking a password is in the set NP.

Problems in P are problems that are quickly solvable. If you don't already know the password, figuring out a well-encrypted password can take many many years with our best-known techniques and on our most powerful computers. Most of our computer security is relying on password cracking NOT being in the set P.

A problem can exist in both P and NP even if the time taken to check an answer is shorter than the time to solve for the right answer - they just both have to be ""quick."" Similarly, P=NP does not mean ALL problems are quickly solvable. There are problems that are not quick to check OR to solve.

I've glossed over quickness because it could easily be a post on its own and is harder to explain without diving into math and university-level computer science. But ""quick"" is misleading and doesn't refer to the amount of time passed. ""Quick"" refers to problems that run in ""polynomial time"" which is a measurement of how quickly a problem becomes more difficult for larger inputs.

If every time I double the input size, an algorithm takes exactly 100x longer to run, it is still considered polynomial time (even if it takes a year to run for a large input!). If, however, the algorithm takes 2x as long for every time I add just 1 (note: takes more and more adds to double inputs as they get larger), then it is not polynomial time (even if it completes in seconds for extremely small input).",False,False,False,31020,714,1377890236.0,False,True

Rainbow tables are a technique that allow you to effectively cover N hashes by every 2 hashes actually stored - and you can set N to be whatever you want.

These tables are specific to each hashing algorithm, and once you apply a salt (effectively changing the algorithm) they're completely useless. You say salts should be secret, else a hacker can just ""loop on them"". That is not as easy as you say! Once you apply those salts the attacker has to brute-force each entry in the database, which is really slow and requires a large amount of computer recourses. Unfortunately the hashes leaked were SHA-1 hashes, which aren't the hardest to brute-force, but salted hashed generated from modern algorithms such as bcrypt can be considered impossible to break, even if the salt is known.

The whole point of rainbow tables is that the attacker saves an immense amount of time, and by just salting the passwords you prevent this type of attack. Thus, even storing salts alongside hashes is not useless, as you claim.

Of course you can try to hide the salts in a separate inaccessible table, so that the attacker has to brute-force this part too, but what makes you think this table wouldn't also be backed up to the same place the attacker accessed in this case? In addition, the table can't be completely inaccessible, after all the login servers need to access it. 

You also talk of encryption and pieces of code, but it seemed in this case that the attacker did have access to both source code and other storage systems, so how would a probably leaked encryption key (for half of each salt, what?) help in this case?

Never said your statements were minor.  I said some of Trump's lies are minor -- like claiming he had the largest attendance at his inauguration even though photo evidence proves otherwise.

There were problems with how the DNC handled the choice of Sanders vs Clinton.  Regardless, Clinton was the better candidate over Trump by a long shot.  She had government experience.  She had gone through several investigations, none of which resulted in charges.  She had experience with other heads of state.  Despite what Trump wants you to believe, you cannot run the country like a business.  Macroeconomics explains why.  Putin has a hold on him.  If on the remote, off chance that Putin does NOT have a hold on him -- which I don't believe -- then he is flat-out incompetent to be holding the office and the 25th Amendment section 4 should apply.

Trump never should have been seen as a viable candidate.  The latest revelation is that Trump changed his campaign strategy right after the DNC analytics were taken.  He made new decisions on where to campaign right after that data was breached.  http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/will_bunch/russian-spies-hacking-trump-democratic-election-20180715.html

**TL;DR: if anything the Nazis were even worse.**

Nazi theories were flimsy even by pseudoscience standards. Lots of 'back to nature', 'women in the kitchen cranking out Aryan babies', 'eternal struggle of the races' sort of shit.

There was no actual socialism involved. Think, at best, 'social welfare', and even then only for proper 'Aryans'. The Nazis were very keen on union-busting and enforcing their semi-fictional Traditional Ancient German Values. Socialist in the same way North Korea is democratic.

The government was a clusterfuck of competing agencies empire building and fighting one another for political favour. Can't betray the leadership if you're too busy trying to push each other under a bus after all.

The economy was a paper tiger inflated with debt and fraud to fund a military buildup. Quite a lot of looting and expropriation of the property of 'undesireables' too. Once they got the war going, they imported large amounts of slave labour from conquered territories. Needless to say those workers were treated very badly.

The ultimate goals were, first, to reconquer ""Greater Germany"" by annexing Austria, the Czechs, Poland etc., and cleanse the disabled/Jews/Romani/people who disagree/homosexuals etc. etc. in accordance with some theories that were flimsy even by Scientific Racism standards. This was a pretty popular plan at the time; skipping the ethnic cleansing parts, the German right-wing at the time was quite certain that at the *very least* the concept of an independent Polish state *had* to go.

Then, conquering Eastern Europe, killing most of the population, turning the survivors into a slave underclass, repopulating the new lands with good sturdy German peasant farmers, something something back to nature, ????, profit.

Possibly a bit in there about giving the French a good slapping, too.

Brute forcing is still effective against individual salted passwords. You can always create a lookup table (e.g. a rainbow table) that covers every possible password+salt combination, in which case you would be right.

However, at that point, the lookup table isn't any better than attempting to brute force each password separately. In fact, it's a lot worse since you spend so much time reading and writing to memory/disk.

Without salting, you only have to guess every possible password once to crack the passwords of all users. Lookup tables are used so you don't have to keep all user hashes in memory and compare guessed hashes to all user hashes for every guess. Instead you can perform one lookup for each _unique_ hash used by 1+ users at the end.

If every user has a unique salt, you would need to add guesses for every possible password to the table _for every user._ You effectively have to create a copy of the same lookup table from the unsalted scenario for every user. The lookup table no longer saves you from repeatedly making the same guesses for each user - since salts make the set of guesses for each user distinct from one another. You no longer save on number of unique hash-used-by-user lookups, because now _every_ user has a unique hash, even if they had the same password.

So instead of generating the entire lookup table of all N possible guesses for each user before performing the lookup, just brute force each user's password separately and you will get it right in an average of (N/2) guesses.",False,False,False,31020,714,1377890236.0,False,True

I've spent about 100,000 hours purely reading and presenting on texts about fascism and genocide, including learning four additional languages to do so.

""Unsubscribing"" from hate groups does not make them go away.  It's like putting a thin blanket on a tiger so that you don't see it.  All the while, it's still very much alive and willing to attack.  It now just has a nice blanket on it so that people preoccupied with other issues can pretend it's just a nice chaise lounge.

The fuck do I care personally?  My grandparents thought German speeches (including the speeches of their new ""governors"") were fucking hilarious until they were ordered to leave their homes.

Thank you. Why couldn't you have done that the first time I asked you to several exchanges ago?

""You took one of my replies as my entire argument.""

Because it's what I actually saw. I repeatedly asked you to clarify where you said initially that brigading and violence was your starting position, and it took you this long to do so.

""Then you claimed I was moving the goalposts, and I denied it, because I had already written my entire argument in other replies to other people.""

I could actually realistically argue that you were shifting the goalposts even in the linked comment, because your **first** one made no mention of this, it was instead brought up as supporting evidence, which, again, is a shifting the goalposts fallacy of the exact same kind I initially accused you of making.

""I don't know if you know this, but you are very very low on my radar.""

I believe you, considering some of the other posts I've seen you make in the past couple of hours. Most of them quite aggressive and visibly angry.

""I'm not following this as closely as you are.""

Aaaaaand how do you know I'm following this closely at all? From my perspective, you were following it *quite* closely, responding to my own comments within minutes. Has it occurred to you that maybe I'm just bored, and have the time to focus on this single comment subthread because I'm not waging a running war with half this entire announcement thread?

""That's why I said you are welcome to look through my comments and see my entire argument.""

I did, and I didn't find it until you pointed it out, after I repeatedly requested that you do so because your comments aren't very consistent and seem to state many different things in no particular order.

""You took this to be an attack on your wellbeing, for whatever reason.

you need to relax.""

Now **this** is a distortion of reality worthy of the finest handmade tinfoil hats. No, I did not take it as an ""attack"" on my well-being, that's laughable. I simply stated that I don't owe you any of the effort you were demanding of me for the sake of clarifying your lazily-constructed replies and their hidden meanings. If anything, the fact that I refused to thoroughly scour all of your comments made in the past three hours or so for anything I might've missed is an indication that I'm actually *not* that invested. 

And, furthermore, even if I was, it doesn't change my own position or undermine it: From my perspective, on *either* position, T_D just isn't that big of a deal when considering all of the other crap subreddits here which do every single thing you've specified. You seem to be maintaining that T_D deserves this sort of treatment, but the other subreddits listed do not, despite, as far as I can tell, doing the same things.

Yes, because it was the line of reasoning I elected to address when I came in here. **You** shifted it towards brigading and violence.

Well, I was addressing your assertion that T_D *in particular* is a ban-worthy Reddit. Personally, I tend to err on the side of generosity and am against bans unless an actual law has been violated, but for the sake of argument, if we accept that certain sorts of technically legal behavior outside of these parameters are ban-worthy on Reddit, and Reddit *does* reserve the right to do this anyway, then it seems to me that consistency, at least, is warranted, hence my own two cents here.

""Those other subs may deserve it as well, however they aren't as popular. In the future, they may become a problem. Currently, they aren't.""

I will need substantiating evidence for this. Statistical evidence, ideally. While I don't generally see as many openly violent posts from the other subreddits, it doesn't exactly make me feel warm and fuzzy inside that not only are certain users on these subreddits tolerated for having...let's call them ""dangerous"" views, but that they are tolerated, **even in the ranks of the moderators**. Threatening to kill someone for expressing an opinion they don't like, **on top** of banning them for expressing it? (Especially someone who's part of the group of people you're claiming to represent trying to help you better represent them.) That's a little extreme, don't you think? This certainly isn't how you ensure they *don't* become a problem in the future. But my real objection lies below:

""Do you see where I'm coming from?""

Yes, I do, but I also disagree: Rules are rules. If you want to stand on principle, you don't do it selectively. If you're going to ban one subreddit for being a *particularly egregious example* of problematic behavior, that's still not consistent. So, to me, either you ban them all, or you tolerate their presence until they cross some kind of legal line or violate another more severe rule. I.E.: If they incite violence and people on the subreddit are linked to it, *then* you start with the bans and arrests. In law, the same underlying principles are used as the basis for the presumption of innocence. ""Innocent until proven guilty."" It seems hamfisted and imprecise but it's the only way to even begin to avoid unfairly selective bans directed at certain groups of people Reddit's staff may happen to dislike for whatever reason. These aren't unerring machines, they're human beings and bias **does** affect their judgment.

On another note, and hopefully leading towards a more productive conversation, there's a **major** problem with social media in general: It **should** be an open forum for people to carry on discussions and express their opinions, whatever they are, but radicalization on both sides and Balkanization of social media platforms is interfering with this. For instance, when a very commonly used social media platform starts to discriminate against certain groups, they are effectively soft-censoring them by denying them access to a widely-used platform where they can talk to a wide variety of people. You and I might **disagree** with conservatives, but it's only fair that we hear them out if we expect to be given a say, too. (Besides, I prefer my political enemies in the open where their statements can be analyzed and deconstructed anyway. The *last* thing I want to do is drive them into hiding, it makes them harder to identify and subsequently deal with. Basically, I'll take a Westboro Baptist Church over dog whistles any day.) Principles act as a shield against self-serving, selective silencing of one group or another. So today, it might be The_Donald, but tomorrow, it could be a pro-Sanders or pro-Corbyn kind of group being banned for having the ""wrong"" opinions and for having the occasional overzealous supporter who wants to strangle someone on the other side. I can still remember when the shoe *was* on the other foot, and I don't want to revisit those days, and that means I have to be **better** than the people who did it. Left or right, liberal or authoritarian, **everyone** should be given a say. I don't know the exact solution to this problem yet. Governments and private corporations alike are corruptible. Some kind of open-standard communications network, maybe something on a copycenter (In case you aren't aware, this means anyone can do anything with the software. The Berkeley Software Distribution, a port of Unix to the x86 instruction set, is an example.) or copyleft (Nobody can sell the software, and anyone can do anything *else* with it, but changes to it must be released to the public in the form of source code so that others may benefit from and use it.) license, might be the answer, I dunno. (I'm *inclined* to say copyleft because copycenter means someone can make a proprietary copyrighted version and sell it. This is how we ended up with Mac OS X and iOS, which is based on the BSD kernel but certainly not free or open, and is in fact limited to legally working on breathtakingly overpriced hardware. At least there are custom third-party versions of Android, which is based on the Linux kernel and is semi-proprietary, but others can still access its source code and Google is required by law to release it and the source code of any updates to it.)",False,False,False,7335,5558,1374949803.0,False,False

""They ban dissent. They brigade other subs.

So do a great many ostensibly left-wing subreddits. Aside from the example I listed of a *moderator* threatening to *kill* someone he banned because he simply *disagreed* with what he had to say, there's also this:

This is a generalization of an entire group of people who apparently have a variety of reasons for being in the GOP. And one thing that I *can* say is that they experience a lot of infighting over disagreements on specific political beliefs and this is statistically provable: Look at how fractured they were during their 2016 candidate nomination process. I think you're forgetting both that, and how many Republicans aren't towing their own party line. If it wasn't for some of those Reps, the ones in Congress specifically, Trump's worst proposals would've gotten through, such as repealing DACA and ruining the lives of *millions* of children. Hell, Comey and Mueller, the people investigating Trump's ties to Russia, are Republicans in their private lives. Does that make them irrational and not worth at least hearing out? Judging by your other comments, you believe he colluded with the Russians. But your main sources are apparently *Republicans*. Let that sink in.

No, and it doesn't mean anything because that's someone *other* than the people I've described. (Someone who I happen to be convinced has a neurological disorder, at that.)

[Even in the welcoming post after the sub was formed](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeanuBeingAwesome/comments/7pobzk/welcome_to_rkeanubeingawesome/) the top comment was about how many posts had been popping up on Reddit which were clear promo shots.  The promo shots at the time were so prevalent on Reddit, that somehow the sub created to share similar pictures [started trending](https://www.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/7pucn0/trending_subreddits_for_20180112/) in 14 hours and already had almost 16k subs.  And sure enough, [it continued to trend](https://www.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/search?q=KeanuBeingAwesome&restrict_sr=on) on two other months since.  It's even had an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeanuBeingAwesome/comments/8chpn7/hi_im_gee_malik_linton_i_directed_keanu_reeves_in/) with a director that worked with Reeves on ""Daughter of God.""    

Now, the reason I brought up that sub particularly, is that back when this sub, and all the ""Keanu Being Awesome"" pictures, first started suddenly popping up on Reddit, happened to be exactly when one of the original writers, Ed Solomon, openly said they were struggling to come up with the funding to make the movie happen.  Studios weren't [convinced the film would release well in theaters, both internationally and in the USA.](http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a848292/bill-and-ted-3-title-plot-keanu-reeves-face-the-music-movie/)  Sorry for that link being annoying, it was an exclusive interview....    

Does Reddit regularly look at stuff that suddenly gains traction, to see if there's manipulation happening?  Even if it isn't some conspiracy or ad campaign aimed at shaping public sentiment, even if it's just the internet being the internet, suddenly turning things into memes, does Reddit care enough to investigate trends or sudden interest regularly for potential manipulation?  Again, back to that first ""Welcome To"" post I linked, although the (by a huge margin) most upvoted comment was about how many obvious promo shots were going around, there did seem to be a lot of genuine excitement around the creation of the sub.  I'm not suggesting that the entire sub is one giant ad campaign to help make a Bill and Ted sequel happen, but using that sub and how quickly it started trending as an example, does Reddit care about people manipulating what Reddit users, as a whole, see?  Whether it's a single ad or an entire community, where does Reddit draw the line from ""this could be the internet being the internet"" and start thinking, ""this could be manipulation?""    

Just to be clear, I'm not asking for a specific line-not-to-be-crossed or for a list of things you look for, but what can Reddit users do to keep an eye out for things that might not be genuine, good faith interest?  With the sub I mentioned for instance, it could be entirely good faith from the community that's interested in a celebrity that seems to be a genuinely decent human being.  It could be mostly that, but sparked off by a PR firm with a targeted ad campaign.  It could even be, in it's entirety, a PR run effort.  What can Reddit users do to actually determine whether something is on the front page because people care, or because people were paid to care?  On our end, we just can't know without Reddit stepping in and actually investigating, because no matter how fishy something looks, maybe we just don't ""get it""?  That's the internet for you.    

Also, on the other end, what is Reddit doing to stop censorship?  It's one thing to look at stuff that suddenly pops up with a hint of suspicion, but what about the stuff that just doesn't get discussed because all discussion surrounding it is quashed in it's early stages?  In the most popular news/worldnews subs, for instance, there have been more than a few stories that just kept being shut down as they were happening, where all threads discussing it were locked and taken down and one comment after another deleted.  Is Reddit doing anything to help deal with this?    

On the one hand, maybe some subs are under moderated, and they need to lock down threads to deal with a huge influx of people surrounding an issue because of the large interest in the story.  But if that's the case, surely making discussion impossible and deleting one thread after another is the wrong way to go about handling it whenever people actually care.    

On the other hand, if it's not a lack of moderators but specific moderators trying to control what people are allowed to discuss or care about, intentionally stopping some stories from being discussed, isn't that a big issue that Reddit should know about and take action to prevent?  Maybe that's okay on small subs where the rules clearly state to avoid some types of content, but on large news subs people aren't allowed to discuss news?  Especially when dealing with large, ""default"" communities, when does Reddit view selectivity in content as an issue of ""manipulation"" rather than a general trend in ideology/leaning within those communities, and what can regular users do about it if they think there is some kind of manipulation going on?    

TL;DR - Sorry for the wall.    

What can Reddit users do to help prevent manipulation?  What is Reddit doing to help users identify manipulation?  What is Reddit's stance on the potential of manipulation when dealing with sudden trends and with sudden silence?

This doesn't look good on Reddit's part.

Even in the FireEye report, it is suggested that this ""influence"" is being used to demonstrate the poor actions taken by Saudi Arabia, the US, Israel et al of late.

It's important that people realize that goes on. I don't disagree with that. But posting ""real, reputable news articles"" is more akin to lobbying than interference.

There's so much insane garbage that's completely made-up that gets posted on various political subs. This isn't stuff that comes in as ""real, reputable news articles"". It's plainly propaganda from Russia and Russian aligned interests here in the U.S.

I get that Americans are traumatised by Russian meddling their domestic election so now any foreign meddling smells threat.

I come from a region where *democracy* is branded as 'foreign influence' because it doesn't align with the government's agenda, because fucking hell even if a concept is valid as long as its 'foreign' it's a threat and it should be censored. This is what China has been doing, and now seems like the US is doing as well? Let's not even mention how these countries own foreign policies are usually invasive and unethical themselves.

In other cases, not everyone is automatically repulsed by the concept of the 'commies', and not everyone agrees with Israel politically and immediately risks being called antisemitic.

&#x200B;

**1 OWNERSHIP**  
The first has to do with ownership. Mass media firms are big corporations. Often, they are part of even bigger conglomerates. Their end game? Profit. And so it’s in their interests to push for whatever guarantees that profit. Naturally, critical journalism must take second place to the needs and interests of the corporation.

**2 ADVERTISING**  
The second filter exposes the real role of advertising. Media costs a lot more than consumers will ever pay. So who fills the gap? Advertisers. And what are the advertisers paying for? Audiences. And so it isn’t so much that the media are selling you a product — their output. They are also selling advertisers a product — YOU.”

**3 THE MEDIA ELITE**  
The establishment manages the media through the third filter. Journalism cannot be a check on power because the very system encourages complicity. Governments, corporations, big institutions know how to play the media game. They know how to influence the news narrative. They feed media scoops, official accounts, interviews with the ‘experts’. They make themselves crucial to the process of journalism. So, those in power and those who report on them are in bed with each other.

**4 FLAK**  
If you want to challenge power, you’ll be pushed to the margins. When the media – journalists, whistleblowers, sources – stray away from the consensus, they get ‘flak’. This is the fourth filter. When the story is inconvenient for the powers that be, you’ll see the flak machine in action discrediting sources, trashing stories and diverting the conversation.

**5 THE COMMON ENEMY**  
To manufacture consent, you need an enemy — a target. That common enemy is the fifth filter. Communism. Terrorists. Immigrants. A common enemy, a bogeyman to fear, helps corral public opinion.

No, so what is the harm in posting articles? To influence American politics, maybe? Except that corporations do that all the time with political ads in favor of one politician over the other. So, I honestly don't see too much of difference between that and this situation. 

&#x200B;

Now, to address the Iran wants to influence American discourse in politics. Well, I hate to break to you, but I believe that most redditors if not ALL redditors have a mind of their own and can distinguish between what is real and what is not. Unless I am completely missing something which I don't think I am (correct me if I am wrong), you are arbitrarily making the decision to ban these accounts for posting articles from The Guardian. 

&#x200B;

What is the difference from me asking my friends to post articles (in a coordinated effort) like the ones they post and this situation? Even if they post these articles that disagree with the current administrations policies and they are from Iran, who cares. I mean I disagree with most (if not All) of the Foreign policy that this administration has. From giving weapon to the Saudis, to bombing 8 f\*cking countries in the middle east to basically giving a (political) hand job to corporations in the form of tax cuts or even giving Israel billions of dollars for weapons that we don't need to give them or even increasing the military budget to the point of being absolutely more ridiculous than it already is (which I didn't think was possible).

​

Yes, I know that you are a private company, but being a company that works in the public square, I would hope that you at least consider the principle of the first amendment when making the decision to ban these people. Otherwise its just a slippery slope.

\-Blazikinahat, A concerned American from New York

​

PS: Next time, I suggest that provide more evidence of harassment, threats, libel or slander before banning them or anyone else for that matter, because like I said before it is a slippery slope to go down.

I was banned from news for pointing out that the mods were deleting all threads about Asia Argento. Also pointed out the threads they deleted regarding the New Mexico compound situation.

Came back the next day to a message from the news mods that I have been banned. No reason given. When asking in a very polite way why I was banned I was immediately muted for 72 hours.

And I mean bizarre in terms of the comment was just my username and a number. It didn’t make any sense in any context regarding any topics in that thread.

Curious, I checked the user’s post history. There was a SHARP divide in their comment history - for the past several weeks ALL of their comments were like that. However... there was then a big gap on the order of several months, after which all the comments became relatively ordinary and made sense.

I cannot help but think its some sort of weird botnet effort or to pass messages or something, I mean you hear rumors about that stuff, but it really seemed like that was the only explanation here - that someone had had an account hijacked by something.

Username was chesh1710, AND incidentally also has a bunch of Russian alphabet stuff in their profile along with what looks like the start of some kind of webaddress, which furthers my belief its a bot.

By the election, most of the ability to verify those usage patterns had disappeared. It’s all long gone now.

I know there are issues with data mining and people sending requests too frequently, but the 1,000 comment limit stymies efforts like this.

8904,olaj7ag,e57jx2h,t3_9bvkqa,t3_9bvkqa,1535806921.0,0,"I strongly feel the need to comment on this find and on the direction Reddit in general has been going in the face of these coordinated attacks.

Firstly, we have to identify the problem. The problem in my eyes is as follows:

* Reddit's administrative system was set up to manage edgy teenagers and script kiddies with limited time and resources. These could be effectively banned into submission.

* Reddit and its userbase is now facing attacks on multiple fronts from state actors, i.e. organizations with comparatively unlimited time and resources. These are relentless and will not stop trying to influence elections and public discourse as long as it is beneficial for their parent nations.

* Reddit's business model was only designed to allow for the staff to effectively handle the former and not the latter. Hiring more administrative staff will lead to a bankrupt Reddit.

Now, let's look at one sub where these state actors are particularly active: /r/politics. It's quite frequent that users will notice newly-created accounts spouting garbage and will report them, as they should. However, these state-sponsored accounts are often much more subtle, and require digging through histories to identify specific posting patterns that are indicative of a public manipulation effort.

About 6 months ago, I identified the following characteristics that suggest that accounts are a part of influence campaigns:

* Accounts posting evenly over 24-hour periods where no single person could do so without sleeping,

* Similar format user names, i. e. a name and three numbers, all of the same account age, posting Breitbart and other alt-right links repeatedly one after another,

* Karma farming on left-wing thread submissions, then posting hard right propaganda in the comments,

* Posting in a single video game or TV show subreddit for karma, and then submitting only pro-Russia threads concerning Putin, Ukraine, Syria, and Mueller,

* One or more of the above combined with Russian-transliterated grammar,

* Valid and logical replies to trolls being insta-downvoted into the negative,

* The same groups of accounts in threads, one of which is the OP, all spouting alt-right racist garbage. The submitting account ""rotates"" among the group of accounts so that Reddit sees it as submissions by different people.

Now, the issue with /r/politics is that the sub has a rule against calling out trolls and bots in the comment threads. A good number of Reddit users aren't stupid and will do the homework to identify them more often than not, but an even greater number will reply without knowing that they are conversing with a bad faith actor. 

A week ago, I and another user identified a large number of other users posting one after another that satisfied the characteristics of an influence campaign in the above bullet points. **I proceeded to call them out and report every thread that the campaign posted. This has earned me a permaban from the sub, and creating an alt to point out the unfair sub ban got me a temporary sitewide ban**.

Let me now point out that **coordinated influence campaigns are a national security issue. One thing we can absolutely not afford to do is let our userbase be influenced by foreign state actors looking to shift the tone of public political discourse, and therefore affect the results of an election**.

The cost of removing the troll callout ban is that some users might get offended by being called bad names.

The cost of keeping it is that the sub's discourse will be affected by coordinated influence campaigns to a much greater extent.

If Reddit's resources are so limited, then a ""trusted user"" system is not adequate for protecting the site. Users themselves must be allowed to inform each other of suspected campaigns for any counter-effort to truly be effective.

Since when is it reddit's role to pick a preferred political narrative and has reddit adopted the position that part of its responsibility to serve as a propaganda arm of the U.S. government?  Even though the majority of reddit users are probably American teenagers with the limited perspective that entails one of the things that has always made reddit worthwhile was that it allowed participation from people around the world so that its users could be exposed to different perspectives.

Now it seems as if the admin staff are deciding for all of us whose perspectives we are allowed to encounter.  Russians aren't allowed.  Now Iranians aren't allowed to post stories from Salon or the Washington Post that support their perspective.  You have taken what looks like innocuous activity and tried to cast it as sinister and all you have done is make it look like reddit is taking on a propaganda role by picking and choosing who gets to speak.

* Accounts newer than 3 months. Almost always a troll or throwaway account, in my experience (more likely to be one of those than a new user, anyway!)
* Account has existed for a suspiciously long time with little to no posts/comments and suddenly is brimming with recent activity.
* Account focuses on only a few topics--normal people have a breadth of subreddits and things they engage in so I'm automatically suspicious of any account that doesn't seem to have hobbies they nerd about in great detail.
* Keeps referencing a certain topic/product over and over. A normal person might very well like ""Tide pods"" for their laundry, but they're not going to freaking bring it up *everywhere*.
* Lingo. A lot of times this is the first clue that makes you suspect them and check their history--how they'll phrase a topic, what words they use and in what context. It really just varies from subreddit to subreddit what's considered abnormal behavior, though.

So basically a company or agenda *could* make a longstanding account that consistently posts and nerds out about their hobbies while also subtly shelling out the propoganda--but that doesn't happen often due to the sheer amount of prep work that would require to make it ""legitimate.""

Because if you know anything about US politics that's complete bullshit. Pro-Bernie sentiment never left /r/politics after Hillary won the nomination, Hillary just stopped getting shit on all the time because political parties tend to consolidate around their nominee after the primaries are over because they want to win the general election, and accept their non-preferred primary candidate as the lesser of two evils. Especially when the alternative in this case was a racist celebrity Twitter troll with no politcal experience. And around 90% of Bernie supporters voted for Hillary, so that shouldn't be remotely surprising. 

I could also point to tons of examples of Trump getting completely shit on in /r/conservative during the primaries, and now the man is their flawless cult leader who can do no wrong. Is that because of a botting conspiracy, or just the sub following extremely basic trends in US party politics? I'm sure there's plenty of astroturfing in /r/politics along with all other notable politcal subs, but a liberal sub backing the Democratic nominee instead of trying to make her lose after she was nominated is not even close to being proof of a large scale astroturfing conspiracy unless you have some actual data to back it up.

Argentinian politics based on hard science."" The subject of Gliphosate use in our country is a very important one, mainly because it's health hazards have been proven and this ad basically directs to doubvios news outlets, where those articles have also been paid for by private companies. Added to this, our userbase has been very vocal about this and looking for ways to block advertisements all around, which we wouldn't prefer because we understand this is needed for the site.

Their lack of knowledge about the states and/or the US division of power between federal and state makes it very clear they are not American.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

The subject of Gliphosate use in our country is a very important one, mainly because it's health hazards have been proven and this ad basically directs to doubvios news outlets, where those articles have also been paid for by private companies.

Why is that a good threshold?  This is like defending Trump by saying he's not quite as bad as Hitler so everything must be peachy.


Reddit's approach to policy used to be:

> We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit.

Doing more research into this server, you find a domain resolves to this same server used by malware, but its purporting to be a news website. You look at the website and find that all of the articles on this 'news site' are false. With a little more digging you find a cluster of individuals promoting the 'news' articles on said site.

* Gathering and verifying all of the possible technical links between your infrastructure you think may be involved in the information operation.

What could have possibly have happened around July 2016 to explain a ""big unnatural shift"" from Bernie to Hillary in /r/politics?

It might have to do something with the democratic primaries, maybe?

>The elections took place within all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories and occurred between February 1 and June 14, 2016. 

So by July it was clear who was going to be the democratic candidate. It was clear that this decision would stand. And in the following weeks most democrats, and many Bernie supporters either accepted that, or, in one of the most remarkable demonstrations of political idiocy I have ever seen, went over from Sanders to Trump.

IIRC it was also about that same time that a certain sub started seriously shitting all over the front page, with lots and lots of wikileaks ""BOMBSHELLS"", that turned all, without exception, out to be unfounded, misleading, made up *shit*.

[LOL that shit has been going on since at least 16, November 2016.](https://bgr.com/2016/11/30/reddit-the-donald-trump-controversy/)

>In a blog post, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman announced two major actions. Stickied posts from The Donald, those that appear at the top of a subreddit’s page, will no longer appear in /r/all. That’s a page that shows users the top posts from across Reddit, rather than just subs they’re subscribed to. It would be like Google de-listing a page from search results: it’s not explicitly censoring content, as you can still find it if you know where to look. But for casual users of Reddit, removing a subreddit from /r/all dramatically decreases that sub’s general reach. 


[Spez even went so far as to outright edit user comments.](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article117231758.html)

>Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, landed in hot water Wednesday after admitting that he used his administrative powers to secretly edit user comments that were critical of him on r/The—Donald - a popular, pro-Trump forum

There is people that mod over 1700 subs. They will carpet ban you from all their subs, even if you never went to them, if you said something *they didn't like*. a default sub,twoX looked up people's names and if they posted on T_D they got banned from twoX, even if they never posted anything there.

You will get banned from a subreddit if you link a T_D post to that subreddit. The owner of this website literally changed how the voting system works because of T_D.

Why is it you are only worried about censorship when **you* are about to get censored?

>First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—

Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People (Hebrew: חוק יסוד: ישראל - מדינת הלאום של העם היהודי‎), informally known as the Nation-State Bill or the Nationality Bill, is an Israeli Basic Law which specifies the nature of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. The Law was adopted by Knesset 62 in favor, 55 against and two abstentions on 19 July 2018 (7th Av, 5778). The law is largely symbolic and declarative. It has been met with worldwide criticism, including from within the Jewish diaspora.

20% of the population doesn't equate to equal rights. Black slaves were 50+% of the population in the slave holding south and Indians were almost 100% of the population of India when it was under occupation. Israel's government is trying its hardest to ensure that non-jewish people are treated as second-class citizens. 

http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-israel-arabs-20180720-story.html

>Steal their land? Whose land is Israel stealing? Ottoman land? British land? Jordanian land? What land is Israel stealing?

Research illegal settlements and the occupation of the West Bank.

>Palestinians live in the west bank and Israel as well. Israel has no troops in the Gaza Strip and it’s controlled by the elected terrorist group Hamas who wants Jewish genocide. Palestinians are allowed to emigrate from Gaza to the rest of the world. Egypt also restricts the border because Hamas helps terrorists in the Sinai. They also bomb and terrorize Israel....


Israel's entire MO is pretty pathetic and it's sickening to consistently see this line of reasoning, that it's fine to kill people with impunity, treat them like garbage and commit human rights violations just because Hamas exists.

Gaza is under seige. The people are under blockade, unable to move freely. I haven't *personally* seen any evidence that Hamas is seeking the genocide of Jews anymore so than I've seen evidence that the SPLC and BLM are seeking the genocide of white people. Furthermore, Hamas is a number of individuals and you literally said all residents of Gaza are citizens of Hamas. It would be insane to say that the entire population of the Gaza strip is seeking Jewish Genocide. Secondly, the Israeli government is more potent as a terrorist organization than Hamas is. almost 90% of the people killed in the conflict since 2000 are Palestenian. By the evidence, the Israeli government is the group attempting to commit genocide. https://israelpalestinetimeline.org/charts/



>They aren’t Israeli citizens. Therefore they don’t have Israeli rights. They are citizens of Hamas under the Palestinian Unity government.

And they aren't allowed to leave thanks to Israel, and they aren't allowed near the borders of their own land because the Israeli government places soldiers within that territory so they can gun down anyone that gets close. They're basically Israel's prisoners. What is it when a group of people are forced to live under one country's rule but they aren't allowed to have any rights? 


>I’ve read the haaretz article about unknowing sterilization of some Jewish Ethiopian migrants. The claim is dubious at best, and at worst effected a few dozen (which still is awful) Certainly not a regularly occurring practice like you make it out to be. 


\Israel admitted to the sterilization.

In the United States, freedom of speech and expression is strongly protected from government restrictions by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, many state constitutions, and state and federal laws. The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized several categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment and has recognized that governments may enact reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on speech. The First Amendment's constitutional right of free speech, which is applicable to state and local governments under the incorporation doctrine, only prevents government restrictions on speech, not restrictions imposed by private individuals or businesses unless they are acting on behalf of the government. However, laws may restrict the ability of private businesses and individuals from restricting the speech of others, such as employment laws that restrict employers' ability to prevent employees from disclosing their salary with coworkers or attempting to organize a labor union.

Just to clear this up, the name for ""firing a load of xmlhttp (aka ""ajax"") requests from a browser to fetch partial page html and stitch it all together"" is *not* ""microservices"".

""Microservices"" just refers to how you structure your internal architecture and systems. It's perfectly possible to have a single monolithic program as your backend and fire dozens of ajax requests to it, and it's perfectly possible to have an actual microservice backend and expose it through a single endpoint.

 1. Start up.  Reasonably simple design, discussion format encourages open discussion while ensuring quality comments bubble up and trolling and rubbish is buried.
 1. Build.  Keep the design more-or-less as-is; any changes that are made happen under the hood and don't really affect the feel of the site itself.
 1. Monetise.  By now the site is pretty popular, and is costing a hell of a lot more to run than it's bringing in.  Time to change that.  Make the site more newb-friendly, change moderation policies so as not to scare off the new investors you need on board.  If that means breaking some things - so be it.  
 1. Decline.  By now, the process of monetisation has been merrily upsetting users for years.  They've been grumbling for some time and some have left, but there hasn't been a mass exodus.  Which means the figures that are actually used to drive the business forward - the metrics that show things like ""number of users"" and ""time spent on the site"" aren't really changing all that much.
 1. Collapse.  By this time, there's a couple of other platforms starting up and they're still in the early stages.  The final collapse will be triggered by a major redesign or change in policies.  Users depart en-masse, the other platform(s) see their user count shoot up and the company which was once valued at billions changes hands for pennies.

What matters is, that we are polluting our only home 24/7 - and that needs to stop asap. Even if this pollution does not affect the climate as much as some people say, we shouldn't be polluting the planet.

If people were educated, they would realize that the entire debate is an academic one and that whatever consenus doesn't give them the freedom to pollute the planet - yet they think, because climate change is not man-made - they can continue to dump their trash everywhere, create more waste, discard still repairable products, waste fossil fuels because it's fun to do so, etc.

______

There is not one single truth and there is not one single perfect political/economic system either. We have theories and decades of different experiences with different parameters. Thus, we need to do our best with these sets of data and make decisions based on that data.

Politics is about manipulating decision makers and voters into supporting certain ideas - an educated society can be more aware of such manipulation because it doesn't agree blindly to whatever someone is screaming into their faces, but is capable to question ideas, theories and presented facts to a much higher degree - compared to an uneducated society.

_____

Another example: people voted for candidate X for various reasons. Some of them voted for him because he promised certain things. If these particular voters were educated, they would have realized that what X promised regarding these particular matters was bullshit.

Some were manipulated to vote for him, but only because they didn't bother to check the facts and also didn't have the proper education to do so - instead, they simply trusted him because it sounded reasonable.

An eduacted population avoids accepting information blindly, because it is aware of the bias and knows the difference between a fact and a viewpoint.

Aha, that isn't exactly true. Even after clicking ""go back to the old reddit"" some aspects of the new programming are still present (such as userpages taking you automatically to ""overview"" now instead of ""comments""). And besides, most internet users have seen this pattern before and expect it to follow the usual outcome. A website has a new layout--at first it's optional but after a few months it becomes the default and the old option is no long available. Youtube has done it, Facebook, news websites, and now Reddit.

It was largely pro-Bernie during the primaries, which meant anti-Hillary stories were okay with more people.

Throughout the process the sub was in favor of the more liberal candidate, that never changed. 

I think some people just misinterpreted the anti-Hillary stuff during the primaries as the liberal base of /r/politics legitimately hating her rather than just trying to make Bernie more appealing by comparison.

Because a large part of my opinion came from hearing a white supremacist speak at OSU, and the whole point seemed to be ""listen to this guy say triggering things, but he can because free speech yo!"" When in reality they had no legal obligation to let him do that.

I know i was kind of mocked when i said there should be a PSA on free speech, but my political science teachers really instilled this idea that free speech protects ALL speech. (bar the fire in a theater thing haha) They even encouraged us to protest on campus if we wanted, but i believe legally we werent guaranteed that right if the campus had choose to take it from us.

Very interesting man, but for the record i do feel like as a republican im more targeted in this whole thing, because it feels like the whole online suppression of misinformation debate started when President Trump was elected and Secretary Clinton lost, but thats definitely based on my local experience.

We live in an age where it's easier than ever to simply look stuff up and get an answer to any question you have or inform yourself about anything you don't know about, and yet people don't or at least don't know how or where to look. Intentional spreading of misinformation and artificial amplification of views muddies the waters and makes finding information even harder, and many are just relying on what other people are saying instead of doing their own research (and those people may be uninformed for the same reason or might be the ones intentionally spreading misinformation).


The PSA about how the Constitution works was supposed to be your high school government class. Think of it this way - the Constitution is the rulebook for how our government itself operates. The government then follows those rules to make and enforce laws that act as the rulebook that society (also including the government) follows. The courts settle disputes by looking at the Constitution and the laws to making sure everyone is following the rules they should be. The Constitution we're talking about here applies to the federal government, but each state has their own constitutions as well to define how their governments operates within each state. The fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution basically requires the states to also respect the rights outlined in the U.S. Constitution, including the ""freedom of speech"", even if their state constitution otherwise would not.


While most of the Constitution says what the government **can** do, the first ten amendments (aka the Bill of Rights) mostly specify some things the government expressly **can't** do. The ""freedom of speech"" from the first amendment prohibits the government from jailing you for sharing your views, but it does not stop a private company from refusing service to you because of views you express. However, the government could potentially use the powers granted to it by the Constitution to make a law preventing private companies from refusing you service because of your views. Note that promoting something like this isn't the typical position of the American political right, which would instead normally be that the government should stay out of a company's business and that if consumers were unhappy with their behavior then they would just move to a competitor.


There is also some leeway granted in what counts as speech that is protected by the first amendment. The go-to example is that you can't use speech to cause immediate danger, like by yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater to intentionally cause a panic. You also can't make death threats, etc. We also put limitations on lobbying and marketing and some forms of corporate speech.


I agree its concerning to think that these large social media monoliths could potentially control political narratives, and I personally think we should be looking into sensible regulation regarding it. However, I also think the recent political outcry about it isn't very genuine and politicians are purposefully misrepresenting things that are happening in order to make it look like certain views are being attacked. As a purely hypothetical example, let's say a platform like Facebook bans explicitly racist content and political Facebook groups that are posting a lot of racist content tend to support Party A due to the nature of current political views. If those Facebook groups get banned, politicians in Party A can say something like ""Look at all these bans of political groups that support of Party A. This is obviously an attack on Party A's political views!"". It's also silly to use the amount of content available in support of Parties A and B as an argument either. Every view isn't going to have balanced 50/50 support and thus having more content in support of A or B isn't inherently a problem if something isn't artificially causing it.


Now, here's where the topic of the OP comes in. What if a topic doesn't have much support, but a group or organization is exploiting the way Reddit works to make it appear as if it does? In your middle school group, you had several dozen real people that genuinely had those beliefs sharing their views first-hand and were properly representing themselves as middle schoolers. But what if your band of middle schoolers hired an agency to create convincing fake accounts acting like informed, voting-age adults from a variety of different backgrounds to further spread your views without disclosing anything and used the fake accounts to upvote each other to further amplify their voice? If you're an individual or even an organization spreading awareness about atrocities that are occurring that you think people should know about, and letting those subreddit communities naturally upvote or downvote the content, then that seems reasonable. If you're a foreign government trying to pretend to be those people just spreading awareness so that you can influence American political opinion then I think there's a clear distinction. And then if you're a foreign government intentionally spreading misinformation, then that's even worse.


Reddit is meant to be a platform for genuine discussion, so if that kind of stuff becomes the majority of content here then there's much less reason to use Reddit. Why wouldn't we want to allow Reddit to be able to protect the integrity of the content on its platform?

In general I don't think that students, faculty and staff should be punished in any way for expressing their beliefs. However I think that campuses have to draw the line a little bit before the government would, both in political and nonpolitical speech. For instance, if you curse at Donald Trump as he walks by you, that is protected speech--but if you curse at a professor you could get in trouble for that.

What about political speech? I would say that a college campus is home for many students, so I would draw the line at speech that makes students feel like they're not safe in their own home. I think this especially applies to when a guest is invited to speak by a student group, since the university is then giving them a platform. You have to tread carefully here because disagreeing with someone isn't the same as making them feel like they aren't welcome.  ""I think we should restrict immigration"" is a valid political opinion and guests should be free to express it. But should a university with Muslim and Jewish students really give a platform to someone who says ""Muslims are all terrorists"", or ""Jews are evil and they control the world""? What kind of message does that send to Muslim and Jewish students who have to live in the university's dorms? Does such speech even contribute to political discussion?

>The U.S. government never hacked into Russian leaders’ emails and released them selectively to favor one side in their elections, or flooded Russian social media with fake stories to discredit their ruling party. What it did do, until the U.S. Agency for International Development was expelled from Russia in 2012, was to help fund some of the country’s leading nongovernmental organizations. These included the human rights group Memorial, the Committee Against Torture and, most important, given the drama to come, a group called Golos, Russia’s main nongovernment organization for election fraud monitoring. This effort was non-partisan and it aimed to strengthen democracy for everyone in Russia, not to steer the outcome.

I think it actually is. If ""discernment"" without the context you'd want others to base their ""discernment"" on, will not be tolerated, then dissent isn't being tolerated. 

Lets just though say you choose to get rid of bad faith actors ""dissenting"". A dissenting opinion may come from a shill operating bad faith, someone who's simply misguided, or... someone with a legitimate contribution to make, which you ignore at your peril.  Therein lies a huge problem. I think that the best we can do is look at their arguments and each make individual decisions that way.  Worse thing we can start to do is take expedient shortcuts, by blindly agreeing/disagreeing, that end up causing more harm.

I'm with you, acting upon vested interests at the cost of all else is a problem. But still a problem in my eyes is folks with a vested interested that they refuse to have criticized or changed for anything. Even if they're not acting on it at the cost of all else, if they're engaging in damaging behavior to themselves, others, and the community because of it, and they refuse to listen to critiques or outside opinions, it can get toxic quick. That's what sticks me on this point, that these folks aren't good faith actors in dialogue, wishing to engage in a back and forth where both parties learn from each other and walk away more informed. They operate linguistically and rhetorically in a way that allows for no compromise, but only acceptance of the espoused viewpoint. That's not dialogue, that's a language hostage situation. I don't feel the need to engage those folks who aren't respecting my autonomy as a human being to make choices, and I don't think the folks rejecting the autonomy of others should be given a platform.

> You risk taking fatal shortcuts based on your own ""vested interests"" if you don't pay someone due diligence.

This is a problem, you're absolutely right. The question of how to value judge what someone is saying is inherently subjective, so it's problematic to develop rules based around it. Not impossible though, and I think that the key here is repeat offenders. If you're posting about a religion I disagree with, not a problem. If you're talking about crystal healing being helpful, I'm not behind it but have at your conversations. If there's a pattern of a user blatantly putting out misinformation to manipulate a dialogue or using rhetoric to incite aggression and hatred, I don't think we are required to, nor should we, give those voices a platform. I think it comes down to, again, the idea of the autonomy of a human being. I'm operating under a Kantian morality at this point which is why I'm such a broken record on the autonomy front, but I think it's morally wrong to disrespect and actively subvert the autonomy of others. When someone is attempting to sway the majority to their side, I think the route is with information, emotional arguments, moral appeals, etc. You put these things on the table and let others make their decisions. The route I'm proposing we deal with is the one where people put out false information, use emotions not to make arguments but to prime someone to receive a rhetoric that targets weaknesses in the decision making process. In short, a route that subverts the autonomy of the people listening.

> Loads of ideological commitments are held on this site. Loads of people are also biased and emotional. If we've established that that's not inherently a bad thing, who then decides what's impossible to believe or discuss?

Not quite sure what the connection is between what you quoted and what you said here. I'll rephrase my point though, and say that because it's difficult and problematic to silence the voices that subvert users decision making process, it's reasonable to tag repeat offenders to give the users a fair heads up of what's in play. It's the same concept behind tagging native advertising as advertising, so that people aren't fooled into thinking that what is product placement meant to manipulate them into purchasing something is genuine content from a trusted source. I think tagging aggressors gives people a new piece of information at their disposal to make discernments about the claims behind made.

> I think it actually is. If ""discernment"" without the context you'd want others to base their ""discernment"" on, will not be tolerated, then dissent isn't being tolerated.

See, I'm pretty open to what the context should be, though I've suggested a tag system. At the same time, I think at the core, dissent is different from manipulation. If you're here to critique the way things are being done, if you're here to push against what's happening because you disagree, that's dissent, and that's not only fine but I think necessary for growth. What I think isn't strictly ""dissent"" is people spouting harmful, toxic shit that's meant to fuck with other's heads, either blatantly or insidiously and subtly. Tolerating dissent needs to be tenant of dialogue guidelines and rules, but the key difference is that dissent operates inside the system. Even if you're rejecting the system entirely, there's a difference between respectfully critiquing the reality of the system and actively attempting to burn from the inside this thing that we've built together. When you use language to exert power over others and manipulate them, it can at times be legally considered abuse, and while I don't think it's abuse at play here, it's a similar construct of the blatant disregard for the human being at the other end of the keyboard, who is being viewed as a chess piece, not as a person. I don't care what your discernment is, but I think everyone should have the context of knowing when someone they are talking to is a serial manipulator and misinformer. If you want to disable the tagging system and go in blind, that's on you. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't provide that option for those of us who are trying to use this place to develop genuine communities and not hives of ideological fury.

> Worse thing we can start to do is take expedient shortcuts, by blindly agreeing/disagreeing, that end up causing more harm.

I hear you. Acting quickly and without thought here is a huge problem, and you don't want to sell folks short without giving them a chance. I think that the repeat offense nature of what I've talked about in this comment speaks a little to that, but I respect that fear of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It can get real problematic, real quick when you talk about silencing others or even simply tagging them as troublesome for everyone to see. I offer you this question however, just to see where you stand on it: Is it ever right to silence someone? If so, what justifies the silencing, and what do we do about the future of that person's right to speech? If not, who becomes responsible for the damage caused by the speech?",False,False,False,13032,68,1385106775.0,False,False

And is it actually that much of a stretch to make a Hitler comparison? You can make a lot of comparisons from Hitler to Trump rather easily. There's the whole ""lugenpresse"" (lying press) and ""fake news"" equivalency, the fact he suggested a department who's sole job it would be to publish a list of ""immigrant crimes"", attacking all journalists in the media who criticize him in any way, blaming all of the country's problems on minority-fringe groups and immigrants.

He fucked up multiple planes, and there's another weird connection with him an the USS Forrestall fire. Depending on the story he was either the first or second plane involved in an aircraft accident that killed 134, and injured 161. The weird thing on that is that it's confirmed that he was basically immediately evacuated from the ship and there's news articles of him in Hanoi that night drinking talking to the press.

The best you can say about him and the Forrestall: He was given special treatment and flown off an aircraft in distress because of his legacy.

The worst you can say about him and the Forrestall: He actually caused it and he was flown off so they didn't kill him for what he did (the claim is he revved the engine on the plane and fucked up and accidentally shot out a missle ... all that is possible and he as known to show off with planes.)

So at this point he's either a coward or a murder, and got pulled off that boat thanks to his family's connections.

Well, he was supposed to be third in line of the McCain naval legacy, and now either way he is an embarassment. How do you save young John McCain?

Well, the next aircraft carrier he volunteered for was the most dangerous one in the naval fleet. Most shot down planes, most POWs of any ships.

Ok, everything I've said to now is verifiable fact, I'll provide the cites if you like, but look at his wikipedia page if you want it's there.

Here's my conspiracy:

He was never a POW. That was faked.

You say: ""He was tortured, he was injured."" ... well here's the interesting thing ... on Christmas Eve his first wife was driving by herself and got into a car wreck. The injuries she suffered are very similar to the ones McCain allegedly suffered as a POW.

So fuck up that he is, bottom of the class, while faking being a POW, he's driving drunk with his first wife and gets into a single car wreck, injuring them both.

The fixer for all this was Ross Perot (look it up, he helped out the McCains a lot) ... but later he had issues with McCain (and Bush, and others, over a bunch of Vietnam shit.)

His quote regarding McCain and his first wife I think is something where you should read between the lines:

""Perot doesn't remember it that way. ""After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [Carol McCain] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [Cindy McCain, his current wife] and the rest is history.""""

So now POW war hero McCain goes into politics, and is actually used to cover-up fuck-ups and live POW issues in Vietnam -- seriously look at his voting record -- why is he doing that?

Even if my conspiracy is bullshit, he's still a fuck-up and he still voted against interests of actual service members.

Now I know this might be a bit to take in, but really think about his legacy and the embarassment of what McCain would have been had he not been he POW. Let me know what parts of this you have questions about, and I'll fill you in with more cites and details.

Can you explain how one is worse than the other in any kind of substantive detail

Wait nvm, I got it—the general public is hyper aware of one, because it’s plastered all over international news multiple times every day, and the other one is more or less entirely ignored under the false pretense that Clinton is ostensibly no longer involved in American politics and as such is entirely irrelevant 

I’m sure if you look around you’ll easily be able to find plenty of examples of people making *exactly* these kinds of excu—

> The Hillary situation is not as important because she is not the president and doesn't have any actual power over the country.


Oh well there you go 

FYI she’s still very obviously working pretty hard to maintain a position of power and influence at the top of the Democratic Party, going so far as to 

• [endorse NY governor Cuomo in his bid for reelection](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/politics/hillary-clinton-endorses-andrew-cuomo-new-york-democrats/index.html) (apparently earning herself a special place in hell for not supporting his progressive opponent Cynthia Nixon)

• [donate directly to nearly two dozen candidates running in midterm elections this year](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/30/politics/clinton-increases-her-midterm-involvement/index.html)

• [headline multiple high-profile fundraising events in the weeks and months leading up to Election Day](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/20/politics/clinton-dnc-fundraisers/index.html) 

And this is all in addition to her public appearances, her book and subsequent tour, the fact that she’s deliberately trying to position herself as a leading anti-Trump voice on Twitter, etc.—so if Clinton no longer has any power or influence over American politics these days, it stands to reason that nobody told her, and it definitely doesn’t seem like the Democratic Party got the memo either

11561,jb4mk2a,e57nd4p,t1_e578l1o,t3_9bvkqa,1535810944.0,1,"The big mistake in the OP is that they didn't actually share the rules that were being broken and just assumed everyone would understand that a foreign influence operation was a bad thing that needed to be banned. Due to the current US political climate that may have been a bad assumption for them to make (not to mention there can certainly be inauthentic users posting in the comments to try to influence people to oppose Reddit taking the steps needed to combat them). There aren't even new rules being introduced in the OP - it's just an informational post to encourage you to be on guard and to let you know what Reddit is doing in response to this activity.


The OP states what's happening pretty clearly though. In their first sentence, they link to an independent report about a suspected Iranian influence campaign that is using inauthentic social media accounts to push inauthentic news sites in order to influence political opinions. The report describes what these accounts are doing and a few ways they can be identified, and I suggest you read the short page about it for more details (or click into the full report if you're especially interested). The OP says that Reddit started investigating based on that report and further worked with third parties to try to find more ways to identify these accounts and to be sure they were part of the operation. That's all right there in the first paragraph.


Most of the rest of the post is detailing what the accounts were doing. They weren't saying ""if you happen to act like these accounts, you will get banned"", but instead are saying ""These accounts are banned because they were being directly controlled by a foreign influence campaign, and here is what the accounts looked like to end-users and the kinds of posts they made"". You can see there really aren't clear identifiers on our side of things to immediately identify them as inauthentic, and that's a point that's being stressed. These inauthentic accounts are going to great lengths to try to look as authentic as possible, both to try to avoid bans from Reddit but also to gain the trust of and avoid suspicions from users.


Your account isn't part of this influence campaign, so you won't be tied to it through the technical markers they are using to identify the inauthentic users (some of which are outlined in the linked report). The campaign's goals are to try to get real people to share the information they're pushing, and that's understood by Reddit, so you're not going to be banned just for sharing what they're trying to get you to share. Reddit is not banning people for voicing sincere beliefs, even if those beliefs are misinformed or happen to be the same as something being pushed by inauthentic users (unless what you're saying violates Reddit's other rules, like by calling for real-world violence, etc).


Also consider that there are likely VASTLY more inauthentic users operating on Reddit than Reddit is capable of identifying and confidently banning. There's also an order of magnitude more people who are sincere users who see and share the content being pushed who Reddit does not want to accidentally ban. This is a hard problem to solve and the influencers will likely continue to improve their methods. The best defense is for end users to understand that these influence campaigns are actually happening and to be critical of **all** information they're being exposed to. If you're forming a political view from information you're reading, make sure to fact check against multiple reputable sources. Differentiate fact from opinion, and only use opinions to widen your perspective but not to just co-opt that opinion as your own just because you saw someone else say it. (And understand that we all suffer from confirmation bias, even when we're aware we are experiencing it.)

Likewise, the Houthi should refrain from Indiscriminate return fire with long range missiles, as it is illegal, and only adds to the cycle of reprisals.

Also, food should never be used as a weapon, like in the above mentioned conflicts. This is why the UN and  US has spoken out against these blockades and allowance of aid to civilians.

250,000,000 Reddit users, 650,000 T_D subcribers.  0.0026% of the site.  Except it was determined that Reddit has FALSIFIED those numbers (pay attention because this is likely why T_D is still on Reddit) and the number of subcribers is actually 6,000,000 based on meta data.  That means Reddit is either releasing false data to its investors/advertisers or false data to its users.  T_D mods raised this issue and I firmly believe it is why T_D continues to exist.  So, it's STILL less than what I claimed because 6M of 250M is 0.024%.

But that's too much for some Redditors.

Listen- I posted in T_D for 2 years.  I gave it up for about a month because I wasn't liking how the community was behaving because there were some legitimately BAD moves the administration was making and it was verboten to discuss them.  I have also given up hope that any real action will be taken against criminal behaviors from past administrations.  I went back to post a link highlighting what is very likely DNC primary fraud in Florida and the link was taken down and I was banned without any real explanation (even after asking for one).

T_D is absolutely a circle jerk, but you've clearly never spent any real time there if you're claiming T_D brigades.  Not only are the rules pretty set in stone, it's against the rules even to link outside of the sub.  Mods can ban you for behavior in other subs.  Archived links are pretty standard to prevent this behavior in places other than Reddit.

Mods don't just not endorse those behaviors, they actively punish it because T_D is a MASSIVE target for Reddit and had to be on a tight leash specifically because Reddit wants any excuse at all to get rid of it.  T_D posts can't even reach the front page because of measures Reddit has taken against T_D that ONLY get taken against T_D.

You claim is bunk.

These are T_D sub rules and they are strongly, STRONGLY enforced.

X    Behavior outside The_Donald

You wanna talk about brigading activities?  T_D gets 18,000,000 unique daily impressions.  It then gets linked outside of T_D.  T_D subscribers then get banned from other subs simply for commenting or being subscribed to T_D.  Any pro-Trump comment outside of T_D gets downvoted to oblivion, regardless the context of the discussion.  T_D community culture is to check ""new"" and ""rising"" to give visibility to relevant daily happenings yet those links, particularly those critical of specific public figures, will start out at negative 30%-50%.  T_D users don't downvote anything.  They upvote what matters.

Dude it's a fucking Chrome plugin, and it's incredibly useful for figuring out if people are here for an actual discussion or are just trolling/lying about their motivations.

No matter how many times you repeat this nonsense, you can't make it true.

One of us is nervous. Again, you should probably take the time to figure out who.

Yeah, that's bs. I read that sub sometimes. The majority is racist. Perhaps you are not, but all it takes is a simple perusal of the top all-time posts to see it.

You get hostile treatment because Trumpets are frequently and blatantly racist and sexist (and a few things more). Maybe you are the exception, but it's delusional to think that behavior is uncommon. The other poster's comments are upvoted by t_d. The ""real issue"" is the enormous pile of prejudices abundant in that subreddit. Fix that and maybe you won't get called out for it.
