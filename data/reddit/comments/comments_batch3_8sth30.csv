Reddit is supposed to be a platform, a platform that you can interact with in many different ways (multiple web UIs targeted at desktop and mobile, apps, 3rd party stuff, etc).  You interact with it in whichever way works best for you, and that's a good thing because it's more useful for more people.  

As such, any new features like this should be device-neutral- able to be accessed from any device.  Otherwise (even in a beta test) you are screening out not only most of the users, but many demographics of users, from giving any feedback.  

I personally would love to try this but I almost exclusively browse Reddit through old.reddit.com (desktop) or i.reddit.com (mobile).  I also use an Android phone.  So I literally *cannot* try this feature.

Your posted criteria [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/e1244tv/) look good on the face of it.  However there are communities that fit those guidelines but also have an extreme bias one way or another, and (on a community/voting level) don't welcome or tolerate alternative viewpoints very much.  
I don't mind a community that has a slant one way or the other, as long as the community (both moderators and users) are tolerant of opposing ideas and are willing to engage in discussion without mass-downvoting well-thought-out but opposing posts.  If that is not the case, then such subreddits should not be included in news.  ",False,False,1529603869.0,418828,14673,1329528395.0,False,True

This is not entirely true. You solicited feedback from /r/Bitcoin mods on 3 separate occasions (4 separate occasions now, because OP just messaged us again soliciting more feedback.). We asked you each time for specifics on WHAT we should be reviewing (because there are no visible changes) and HOW news threads were being aggregated. On all 3 occasions we were completely ignored, and therefore were unable to provide any feedback at all. *Moderators have no indication whatsoever which posts are visible in the News section*, and it is unlikely that reddit admins have done enough to curate fake, clickbait, and plagiarist news domains.

We have set guidelines for the communities that filter into the experience, as well as the post type (for example: posts titles must reflect the article title). 

This isn't good enough. The problem with news sources and the internet in general lately is the overwhelming amount of biased, fake or exploitative articles and posts submitted online. This ranges from political beliefs, organisations paying for headlines and covert advertising all the way to simply segregating people into two different groups with opposing opinions. How are you / how have you dealt with this issue? What features are in place that will make Reddit a trustworthy news source and not a completely biased and manipulated one?

So far, from the .gif above, you've shown nothing other than a filter of sorts. This is barely a news tab but rather a ""categories"" tab and the implication that it is a source for news is just dangerous. Certain subreddits, some/one of which was/were displayed in the .gif, have natural biases that either link to or slightly modify articles that have a blatant preference in whatever it is they're reporting on. You can't guarantee the authenticity of a piece of 'news' either - who's to say that a manipulative post doesn't get a lot of attention, is shown on the News tab and then falsely feeds its browsers and lurkers information that is incorrect? Sure, the mods should be monitoring this stuff but if they link to an article and the headline is the same as the one in the Reddit post then they're not breaking any rules; now imagine that article and headline is now completely and utterly false and its objective is to push a narrative or promote discontent. 

You could've seriously used this as a new and effective tool that'd draw in more users whilst still going against the current trend of 'dangerous news' but instead you decided to follow other large sites such as Facebook and Twitter - both of which suffer severely from, and are the main offenders for, the exact 'dangerous news' I just mentioned. This could've become something like Elon Musk's idea called ""Pravda"" or the already implemented website [allsides](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) where the authenticity and leaning of a source could be judged anonymously. Alas, this will just further contribute to the ongoing issues with segregation and political beliefs.

Odd, from my experience r/worldnews tends to be a massive, systemic circlejerk of anti-Trump, anti-Russia, anti-Israel content. Users are discouraged from expressing their opinion because they don't want to get downvoted or insulted, (which is why subs such as r/The_Donald are so pervasively right-wing). If you want to make a change, get rid of the downvote feature. It will promote conversation at every point of the site and minimize segregation, which is a very real concept that very few address. If someone is insulting another user, there is a Report feature for that. The downvote feature is a catalyst for isolating specific users with specific views in specific areas of Reddit. Unless that's what you're going for, of course. That's why it's impossible to find a genuinely neutral source of news, because outlets such as CNN or Fox News tailor specifically to their respective audience, regurgitating exactly what their readers want to hear so as to not induce cognitive dissonance.

This list helped us to identify communities that met a minimum threshold of engagement with posts from the domain list.

>  
>The community must have active moderation  
>  
>The community must require that the post title accurately reflects the article title

Reddit is supposed to be a platform, a platform that you can interact with in many different ways (multiple web UIs targeted at desktop and mobile, apps, 3rd party stuff, etc).  You interact with it in whichever way works best for you, and that's a good thing because it's more useful for more people.  

As such, any new features like this should be device-neutral- able to be accessed from any device.  Otherwise (even in a beta test) you are screening out not only most of the users, but many demographics of users, from giving any feedback.

Your posted criteria [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/e1244tv/) look good on the face of it.  However there are communities that fit those guidelines but also have an extreme bias one way or another, and (on a community/voting level) don't welcome or tolerate alternative viewpoints very much.  
I don't mind a community that has a slant one way or the other, as long as the community (both moderators and users) are tolerant of opposing ideas and are willing to engage in discussion without mass-downvoting well-thought-out but opposing posts.

*As news of the Orlando mass shooting broke on Sunday, internet users turned to the /news subreddit to find out what was going on. But instead of the breaking news and comment they were expecting, they found comments deleted and threads locked. Even information about how to give blood was blocked.*

*Unbelievably, the most detailed discussion of the events in Orlando ended up taking place on the /The_Donald subreddit - not the place you'd expect to have to look for unbiased news.*

I don't mean to be presumptuous by that, rather, I just recognize that Reddit admins are human.  And when you spend your days talking about things like engagement stats and revenue per monthly active user and whatnot, it's easy to become focused on what you are trying to do (make money) and lose sight of what you are and why people love you (the platform).  

A perfect example of this is the old Digg redesign.  Kevin Rose had a vision for Digg- a place to curate the best of the news and whatnot.  But in implementing that, he lost sight of what he had- a community.  So with all the best intentions he launched Digg v4, and alienated most of his most loyal users.  While Digg was ignoring its community, Reddit was providing a fertile ground for communities to grow.  

Unfortunately, Rose didn't listen, and as a result Digg went from being one of the most popular sites on the Internet to a long-forgotten footnote in Web history.  

The great leader Dukhat once said, ""When others do a foolish thing, you should tell them it is a foolish thing. They can still continue to do it, but at least the truth is where it needs to be.""

It wasn't compounded with any hateful speech

It's a word, and if sad internet warriors can't handle words than that explains why they're here on the internet and not out confronting real hate speech, because they're pathetic facist losers who want to try and control the words that come out of other peoples mouths if these words don't fall into what **they** deem as socially acceptable, and in my opinion, that makes them a bunch of gay dumbasses.

free speech is impossible on the normie net now. and the places that are supposed to be free speech end up attracting an overpopulation of extrema which puts off anyone else from using it.

I would say maybe bitchute is the only okayish youtube equivalent type site. But for news and discussion, i mean you'd have to go to a chan [4 or 8] and thats usually just hard left and hard right. 

lets look at fundraising patreon alternatives. You have freestartr that was a professional approach alternative to patreon (patreon which has been breaking the unruh act in california pretty frequently -can't discriminate by political affiliation)

So what happened with the philosophy of ""if you don't like it build your own""? well  it ended up having its main payment processor suddenly reject freestartr after completion and finalisation of the deal and now its left relying on crypto and other stopgap measure to run.

If people's political ideology interferes in the very basis of hosting, domains, delisting from google, demonetisation from youtube, choices by people in mid level positions of power in payment processors, and so on, how can we say there is such a thing as free speech on the net? what happens when the politics you don't like is in power, the tools of reppression used on your ideological counterparts would then be used on you.


In fact the only thing not yet targeted by the far left [and me pointing it out makes it vulnerable] are the sites that help support superchats for things like irl streams or debates online. 

Once that is done, there is no free speech because free speech costs money.

I don't think it was completely glossed over. I remember there being a lot of frustration about that and front page posts at the time. I think people just felt powerless to do anything about it and felt Trump was a greater evil.

Not unlike how many conservatives who weren't fans of Trump's behavior still banded around him after the primaries due to what they felt was the greater evil of Hillary and liberalism.

Now onto your claim about CNN being better than Fox...

Here's an incredibly short list of times CNN has knowingly lied about things to advance an agenda:

1. [CNN editing video to create a lie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8Cn6boqcA&feature=youtu.be)

2. [CNN and Anderson Cooper lie about past reporting they've done, and pretend that audio of Hillary laughing about a child rape case is somehow ""not authenticated""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpwPwhvabi8&feature=youtu.be)

3. [Here's CNN's Don Lemon doing the exact same thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvb3MdgCZPw)

4. [Here's CNN pretending that looking at Wikileaks is illegal... But it's ok for them to do it... because they're the media...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg)

5. [Here's CNN coaching their ""focus group"" on what to say after the debate...  Spoiler, it's pro\-Hillary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI)

6. [CNN doesn't want to tell us what Trump *actually said*, so they'll just doctor his tweets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Eps97Mp_s)

7. [It's always so unfortunate when technical issues cause cuts in feed every time someone say something bad about Hillary... especially when they were with Bernie till the end!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw)

8. [Of course they would employ Donna Brazile, head of the DNC, who is happy to pass along debate questions to Hillary. At least until she got caught...](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-shared-additional-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign-identified-her-tipster/)

9. [And then the same thing happened for Wolf Blitzer. In fact, CNN got every DNC staffer's input on what questions they would like this ""impartial objective news service"" to ask Trump](http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/06/wikileaks-emails-cnn-asked-dnc-for-questions-for-interviews-with-trump-cruz/)

10. [Here they are backing down after being threatened with a lawsuit for calling Assange a pedophile](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/312654-wikileaks-threatens-cnn-with-defamation-suit-over-pedophilia-claim)

11. [Don Lemon identifies ""random protestor"" as a CNN technician, after an astroturfing spiel about the electoral college!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6izexFkN4)

Now please go ahead and show me how Fox did the same.  CNN is, with no doubt whatsoever, a fake news organization no matter how you define fake news.  For goodness sake, they pretended their cameraman in the field was a protester to advance the political agenda they wanted to advance.  That is verifiable fake news.  They colluded with the Hillary campaign to ensure that Hillary would know the debate questions in advance of the debate, that is actual collusion (as opposed to the bullshit Russia collusion).  So let's see your list of Fox doing anything like this.  Fox is certainly biased right, but they aren't fake news like CNN.

Here's Wikipedia's discussion of it:

>Algorithm
Through the use of ""sticky posts,"" a moderation function of Reddit that allows selected posts to be artificially placed at the top of a subreddit, the moderators of the forum were ""gaming"" the algorithms[76][77] in order to dominate the content on the /r/all page, which is a representation of the most popular content on the website.[3] Additionally, users are often apt to flood the website with waves of identical images or posts, a direct violation of site-wide policies regarding spam. In response, Huffman rolled out a change to the /r/all algorithm; he noted that /r/The_Donald was among several Reddit communities over the years that ""attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else.""[13] Ongoing problems with members of the subreddit brigading and harassing other subreddits forced Reddit staff to modify the site's software algorithms to limit the offending posts to the subreddit. The Reddit team introduced /r/popular to replace /r/all, which included most popular subreddits except for The_Donald, and as a result the subreddit could no longer reach the front page.[78][79] In February 2017, Reddit overhauled their algorithms even further to prevent content from the subreddit (among other communities) from ever being seen by logged out users or people who do not have a Reddit account.[46]

Where'd I do that? Please show me. 

That community was taken down for repeatedly and flagrantly violating Reddit's TOS about targeted harassment. Remember that? When FPH had an organized, concerted, subreddit-wide effort to bully and harass people who had nothing to do with the FPH subreddit? Reddit had every right to do that, but it wasn't because of illegality, it was because of a different content policy of the website.

Not feeling particularly persecuted at the moment. Illegal subs get taken down, albeit often way later than they should, and Reddit is better for it.

So?

Of course I do. Only an imbecile would look at what proto-fascists like you are doing to the world and think there's still room for nuance or tolerance or (faux) centrism.

Your feelings simply aren't important and shouldn't be protected, your views are abhorrent and deserve to be condemned in the strongest possible terms and through the strongest possible means.

So yes, I hate you and everything you stand for, any rational person would, and it gives me great comfort to know that the vast majority of the world agrees with me.
