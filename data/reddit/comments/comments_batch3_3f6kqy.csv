- Join me in welcoming krispykrackers to her new and much deserved role of Head of Community at reddit!

- It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now.

- Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause.

- Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community.

- I want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community.

A lot of people can feel very isolated in the real ~~weird~~ world, whether it's because of depression or social anxiety or anything along those lines. I think one of the main reasons (aside from pictures of cats and boobs) that people keep coming back is that sense of community that reddit creates that is so often lacking in people's lives in the real world. 

I think /r/thebutton is an excellent example of that. Just a button and a timer with no guidelines or instructions, and yet out of that, enormous communities (and even rivalries) formed out of what color your flair was. Such an awesome experiment (read time-waster). 

That being said, I'd like to thank you /u/5days for all of your help in making reddit as awesome as it is!

As someone who is a scientist who studies popped corn products, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls kettlecorn popcorn. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""popcorn family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of orvillae, which includes things from toffeecorn to crackerjack to movie theatre butter.

So your reasoning for calling a kettlecorn a popcorn is because random people ""call the sweet ones popcorn ?"" Let's get chocolate dipped and popcorn balls in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A kettlecorn is a kettlecorn and a member of the popcorn family. But that's not what you said. You said a kettlecorn is a popcorn, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the popcorn family popcorn, which means you'd call Doritos, Bugles, and other corn snacks popcorn, too. Which you said you don't.

Darren Wilson is a hero.

Mike Brown had strong armed robbed a store just minutes before his death. When Wilson saw him, he did not know about the robbery. He stopped Mike Brown for walking in the middle of the street.

Brown, when confronted, like a typical thug with no respect for the law or authority decided it was in his best interest to attempt to fight an officer, grab his gun, and he lost.

Mike Brown, like so many of his 'brothers' would still be alive today if they possessed an ounce of common sense and chose more carefully their actions instead of thinking they're above the law. Wilson did the community good by taking another thug off the street.
