So a few years ago now, there was a guy who (to summarise) was giving detailed information about how he was causing serious harm to someone. It alarmed me so much that I contacted numerous law enforcement agencies in the US, desperately trying to find someone who had the power to look up this guy's information, track him down, and at least confirm or deny what he was saying. 

I tried 4 different agencies, ranging from federal to the city-state he was in, and all of them said that without my knowing the guy's physical whereabouts, they legally couldn't do anything. And that sucked.

So my question is, if we *do* see highly questionable content that should be reported (I'm not talking about drugs or silly things like that, I'm talking about when people make serious, serious threats), who on earth do we turn to? What agencies actually have the legal right to ask Reddit to hand over personal information?

Normally, of course, I'm all for protecting people's privacy as much as possible. Reddit it obviously meant to be a private community protected as much as possible from invasive monitoring.

Not trying to disparage you, because I found all of this intensely interesting. I am just genuinely curious at what this is aimed to accomplish. 

Is this for users who are potentially using reddit while living in oppressive regimes where access to information is heavily censored? Is it to protect the user from legal consequences if they participate in acts that are considered illegal? Is it just a broad counter-measure to increased data-collection capabilities of western liberal democracies, in case shit eventually hits the fan? Is this aimed more toward someone in a state like China or Russia that has a very real existential threat to their safety if they participate in discourse against the government, or does this apply equally to democracies like the US, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, or the UK?

It's timeconsuming to get numbers leading to a meaningful presentation, so most mod teams choose not to show poor data that confuses more than it helps to their users.

---

For similar reasons, I'd advocate for reddit removing the /about/traffic pages as they're so grossly misleading without mobile traffic they're worse than no data. That's again the same reasoning behind the sound decision to remove the grossly inaccurate upvote/downvote counts from the comment data API.

If we could easily break down removals automatically (say an interface showing what automod rule removes something) we could also provide meaningful data on what's being removed rather than a report that simply says ""x items were removed."" and leaving users to guess what that means, and fill in the analysis simply based on their preconceived ideas on the topic.

---

I'm not surprised Spez is a fan of this sort of no-context presentation because reddit seems to systematically avoid providing context for numbers they present.

That's a big part of their media strategy because then you just have to trust their interpretation and repeat the angles they push because that's all the data you've got to work with.

Why is okay to push one agenda, but not the other? Yes, Reddit can do what they like, sure - but hey, being professional doesn't help. Why are Reddits admins and moderators not impartial? Just go on any default sub, check the mods, and check the other subreddits they also mod. You'll notice a pattern. Don't take my word for it, do it. 

Default subs that by and large have nothing at all to do with politics, regularly hit the front page with Anti Trump rhetoric. Someone hung a banner out that 3 people saw? Front page.

>Did we mention that the doll is black and Sophia is white? (go on...)
The issue came up right away, when a store cashier asked Sophia: Wouldn't she rather have a doll that looked like her? (of course she did)
**According to her mother**, Sophia had a ready answer.
""She does (look like me)!"" the toddler responded. ""She's a doctor; I'm a doctor. She is a pretty girl; I am a pretty girl. See her pretty hair? See her stethoscope?"" (REALLY? she said that, did she?)

Yeah, that happened. This is news. Not a joke, this is a genuine story someone actually wrote, and there was actually a process involved of ''should we put this up?''. How can anyone trust the integrity of these places, when this fiction is actually...promoted as news.

Police would then try to get as much information about John as possible. Let's say Jane knows where he lives, so the police go out to his house but he's not home. The next step would be to look around the area. maybe there's some woods near the house or something.

It wasn't just one misquote, how did you draw that conclusion? Do you just believe in everything the MSM pushes out?

2. /u/spez abused his powers and changed multiple comments, something that should have gotten him fired but since it's against Trump supporters it's ok. Due to the vilification of the left somehow convincing themselves and others that pro-Trump people don't have the same rights and are some type of subhuman in their eyes. 

3. It's not a Muslim ban, stop saying it's a Muslim ban because 90% of Muslims we're not effected from travel. Indonesia is home to one of the largest Muslim populations but they weren't on the list. The countries that we're listed were done so because of harboring potential terrorist by the Obama administration. So you can blame the previous President for that one, Trump just enacted a temporary ban of travel for these areas to work out a better vetting procedure.

""The outcomes of radicalization are shaped by the ideas of the society at large; for example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society or from a broad desire for change in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into violent extremism (RVE).[2] [3] There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing.[4][5]""

When someone says ""radical"" they can simply be talking about pushing to more extreme ideas. If you dont think t_d pushes to a more extreme right wing agenda then I dont really know what to say. Not all radical ideas are bad. But they are radical relative to society. Please people, avoid knee-jerk reactions. 

I shouldnt have used alt-right because i knew that people wouldnt take the time to actually think about words and context... Can we please get back on topic now? 

Should reddit try to stop radicalization? I think it is a slippery slope and i believe the real radicalization begins long before someone is thrown off a roof or beheaded.

If it helps, I also believe there are radicalized liberal agendas at play as well and they would be radicalized using the same core function thqt applies to the radicalization of violent islamic extremists. That is to say, fear of an unknown boogeyman who is attempting to stifle and censor their beliefs. I apologize if anyone was offended by my wording but I do think that how people are radicalized is an important thing to think about.

For pulling down those posts, I know there's a large dataset of public reddit comments available on google big query: I'm not sure, but I think there's another dataset of submissions as well, so you could just pull from there en mass instead of scraping reddit directly.

I got a call at 5am, my friend and also ex-GF called me from a bridge 100 miles away to say thanks and goodbye. I kept her on the line and called police when the line broke. She told me I betrayed her trust. In the two months afterwards when we still spoke, she would occasionally talk about her medication and how it was affecting her negatively. She didn't do so in a way that seemed spiteful, only as a matter of pointing out how she felt like anyone else would say ""Ugh I'm so tired"".

I was so unsure of whether she would have actually jumped off the bridge, whether I had trapped her in a bleak and painful world of medication and side effects, whether she could ever really be happy again. Whether or not I should have let her jump, since I couldn't even hope to scratch the surface of understanding what she must have felt. I wrestled with the guilt that maybe I had condemned her to more torture than she deserved to endure. People, friends, would tell me I was a hero and I did a great and brave thing, but I couldn't whole-heartedly believe them.

She stopped talking to me two months afterwards, and I haven't heard from her since. I bumped into her dad once, and found out she went to college. But to this day I don't know if she's doing well.

It took three years before I could really accept that I'd done the best I could, with the best of intentions, and that there's​ nothing I could truly blame myself for. Though I still wish that I'd known earlier how to suggest that she seek help.

I hope that with continuing advancements in the field, your friend might be able to receive more appropriate treatment. And I hope his life turns around, because you made a strong decision from a place of caring. I know how hard it is to make a decision like that, and I hope that such a genuinely good-hearted action has a positive result, no matter how long it takes.

It's harder than most people can imagine to make that call, and the uncertainty and guilt that follows is totally unfair, but sticks with you for a very long time.

>Islamic terrorism is the overwhelming majority of terrorism

The majority of terrorist attacks in the world today involve people who say they follow different versions of Islam. In battle torn regions, terrorism seems like the only option for some groups and whether all attackers involved do it willingly is up for debate. Occasionally, in Western countries, some lone wolf nut decides to jump off the deep end without having much/if any contact with daesh. They then lay claim to said attack because that's what they want. A stated goal is to drive a wedge between normal law abiding Muslims and those who aren't Muslim. To sow distrust, suspicion and fear. You can help daesh with that, if you'd like.

As an outsider, it appears Trump supporters like democracy if it works for them because they didn't even win the popular vote. When people question them, which is what you do in democracies, they tend to get uncomfortable.

As for the UK and Brexit; I'm of the view that the leave people are the ones out of touch. They want the past whilst we are heading to the future. We'll have to see how it goes. Hopefully it won't be as bad as some people think, but I highly doubt it'll be better than if we stayed. If it does go to shit though, I'm with Farage. Emigration calls.

If you call our 911 center from a landline, we automatically get the address and phone number. However, most of our calls our from cell phones. A cell phone will always provide what's called Phase 1. That tells us the tower that it hit off of and a general direction. Might be something like ""TOWER: 123 MAIN STREET NW SECTOR"". Phase 1 data isn't very useful, but can give us a very broad idea of where you might be. Let's say I hear what sounds like racecars driving, and let's say we have 2 racetracks in the county (we don't). I may be able to figure out which one you're at based off what tower your call came from.

If your phone has GPS and it has a location fix, it passes that on to us. That's called Phase 2, and not every 911 center supports it. Even if you have GPS disabled, it overrides and turns itself on if you call 911.

Neither of those above things require an emergency disclosure. If your phone calls 911, it's assumed you have an emergency and that information pops up automatically, usually within a few seconds.

The problem is if we need to track a phone that *hasn't* called 911. That's when we'd most likely call the phone company. Your phone is constantly ""pinging"" towers that are nearby to see which one to use. Most towers have directional antennas. Towers actually have a long range, about 20-40 miles. If you're in range of at least 3 towers, the phone company can triangulate your location from using signal strength data. Imagine that each tower has an invisible circle around it. Where all those circles overlap is where your phone is. The more towers you're in range of, the more accurate a ping will be. Your phone also keeps this ping data for a few days for this very purpose. They can also use other data, such as WiFi or mobile data usage, or they can get a GPS fix as well.

I think you're misunderstanding: you'd tokenize on sentences for the purposes of training, so an entity that gets scored is a full sentence. But part of the training/scoring pipeline would be to do some processing on the input sentence: either chunk that sentence up into words, or even go down to the character level (which sounds insane, but is actually the state of the art with neural language models). Recursive neural networks are tolerant of variable length inputs, so regardless how many characters/words/tokens are in a particular sentence, we could pass a full sentence into the model and it would be able to do some sophisticated stuff figuring out how the different words work in relation to each other. 

Ultimately, a large amount of the lift from a model predicting suicidality is going to be honing in on certain words or phrases, like ""kill myself"" and ""end it all"". But building it this way makes it so the model figures out for itself what it's interested in.

There are a couple reasons why I specifically suggested classifying sentences rather than whole comments.

* A lot of posts in /r/suicidewatch are just titles, so it would allow us to normalize the training data to roughly equal size ""documents"". Otherwise, the model could become biased to expect that comments of certain length (e.g. either really short or really long) are predictive, when actually this would just be an artifact of how the data was constructed (title only submissions vs. self posts).

* It allows us to be more defensive. If someone expresses something dangerous in one sentence but goes and on about their school for the bulk of their comment, a model trying to classify the whole comment might correctly determine that the comment isn't *about* this person's thoughts about self-harm. Which would be true. It was just something they mentioned briefly, but we're still concerned. Classifying sentences instead of comments means each sentence is a new opportunity to throw a red flag, whereas classifying the whole comment means we only have one opportunity to make a decision.

Umm... citation? Please cite the specific section that says this, since I am not finding anything that confirms this. 

But even if you can cite it, you are still wrong. No one said anything about owning an explosive. The question was *explicitly* about *teaching*, not about *owning.* The citation you gave was about *teaching.* You then claimed that ""intent doesn't matter"", when the very citation you gave *explicitly says intent matters.*

>  Therefore, any audience viewing and using the tutorial to make a destructive device is committing a ""Federal crime of violence"". 

This is just laughably absurd. Do you really not think I could make a tutorial without actually owning a bomb? You have never seen a recipe? A written tutorial? Hell, even if I taught you in person and walked you through the process, I could do so using fake ingredients. 

>  And, therefore, you would be in violation of the law knowing the information you provided was used to create said destructive device.

You have never learned something simply for the sake of curiosity? I have watched videos and read tutorials on many things that I will likely never do.

I think it is safe to assume that you are not a lawyer?

Simply providing the information DOES NOT show intent. 

>  It would be easier for the Federal government to prove you provided the education knowing someone out there would use it illegally than it would be for you to prove you knew every single person that obtained the information would not use it illegally. 

Yes... Which is why if the intent did not matter  *they would not explicitly write it into the law that it does.* 

Your argument is just incredibly stupid. It literally makes no sense at all for them to include two very specific clauses about intent if they mean it to apply universally. They would only be providing a possible loophole that people could get out of.

This still does mean, however, that they are linked in some way; someone that Wikileaks trusts enough to provide accurate leakable documents has ties to Russian Intelligence.

This was suspected when the timing of several emails from Clinton campaign staff was leaked through Wikileaks coincided directly with events that would have been a boost to the Clinton campaign (such as the Democratic convention and during the Trump ""grab them by the p****"" release).

Technically, we didn't really have much in the way of direct confirmation until the director of the FBI announced it as a part of his general report to the House Intelligence Committee on Russian Interference in the election on March 20th.

The full transcript is available on the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/), but the part that confirms it directly is here:

>SCHIFF: And there was an effort by the Russians to cover up their break-in of the Democratic Party headquarters, by using cutouts like WikiLeaks to publish the stolen material, isn't that right?

> COMEY: Certainly to cover up their -- that they were the ones releasing it.

It's mentioned again here:

>SCHIFF: This is a question I think you can answer. Do you know whether the Russian intelligence service has dealt directly with WikiLeaks or whether they too used an intermediary?

>COMEY: We assessed they used some kind of cutout. They didn't deal directly with WikiLeaks. In contrast to D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0.

And one more time here:

>[CASTRO]: So, let's move to WikiLeaks for a moment, who played such a prominent role in the 2016 election. As has established before and reestablished at this hearing, WikiLeaks was at a minimum an unwitting pawn and, at a maximum, an active co-conspirator of the Kremlin's in publishing stolen DNC and senior Democratic officials' e-mails. And so you agree this was done in order to offer Moscow some measure of separation as to mask its hand in having hacked and stolen the data in the first place, but so it could still have it publicly posted to inflict damage on the Clinton campaign?

>COMEY: Yes, I think that's fair.

I wouldn't say this means that Wikileaks is 100% compromised by Russian Intelligence. And heck, it might still meet your definition of ""trustworthy source"" since the leaks they provided on behalf of Russian Intelligence were still technically accurate.

But there's one pretty damn trustworthy source: the director of the FBI confirming that Wikileaks released documents on behalf of Russian Intelligence, somewhere between being a pawn or an active co-conspirator.",False,False,False,12232,96,1319339414.0,False,False

This could simply be a difference of what OP was talking about and what I was asking for.  I wanted a news article, or a page promoting his assassination.  Not some random tom dick or harry loon suggesting it.  

It's a piece of cake for some crazy person to do or say something like that, but it's an entirely different situation if you have an actual post about assassinating a president being upvoted and promoted by a subreddit.

This is a separate illegal act and is unrelated to the legality of their presence in this country. I agree that it is a problem that needs to be addressed.

Would you even be willing to accept that I agree with you? Our immigration system is massively flawed. There needs to be a systematic overhaul of the entirety of the process. We absolutely need to secure our borders, if only for national security and anti-cartel reasons. 

My only problem is that the *reality* of decades of failed reform and failed enforcement has lead us to a world where illegal immigrants are so entwined in our economy that it would be suicidal to contemplate anything except their continued residence inside of our country. Ignoring literally dozens of other equally compelling rationales, I am very serious that we cannot displace the 12+ million people in this country illegally without irreparably fucking ourselves. There isn't a way around that.

Yes, I am for euthanasia. I also agree with you (kind of inferring here) that mental illness is too often perceived to be not as disabling or problematic as physical illness. The difference, to me, is that our ability to gauge whether or not a mental illness is treatable is far more nebulous than our ability to come to the same conclusion for physical disabilities. I suppose it's also a bit of a Catch 22 situation to mandate that euthanasia on the basis of mental illness be chosen in sound mind.    

However, to my knowledge the vast majority of mental illnesses which commonly drive people to suicide are in fact treatable, though the amount of attention and effort necessary (whether by the troubled person in question or a professional) may be particularly extensive.  

Also, one of the big differences between euthanasia and suicide is the process. I forget where I read this (so please tell me if this has been debunked – it's been years death was so present in my life) but to my understanding, many suicidal individuals act not only impulsively, but have little concept of the long term. The findings explained that the content of suicide notes is more often very immediate stuff like ""i'm sorry"" or simply things that have led up to it or what's going on in their minds at the moment, rather than planning for their absence or anything of the like. Sure, they might not care about that stuff because they intend to die, but in that case they probably wouldn't leave a note in the first place. SO, I think in the case of euthanasia, the process of applying and waiting for it allows for time to cool down and consider what they're doing before choosing such a dramatic solution.

*If you were to read only one part of this post, I would hope it's this:*

I think euthanizing someone as a result of mental illness is quite different from what I would explicitly refer to as suicide because it would involve a clinical expert, and would likely be a longer process. This allows time for critical thought. I just don't believe in suicide as opposed to euthanasia, as one involves a mentally ill person – alone – making a drastic decision that they might otherwise regret if they were of sound mind, while another involves someone who is definitely capable of rational thought, is equipped to help, and can offer a slew of potential, less tragic solutions first.",False,False,False,104732,12112,1285702241.0,False,False

Yes. Just like your home, or your own club would.

Instead, these bridagers could have started their own ""sports"" club where they can vote on the sport they are playing that week. This is difference between broad political subs like r/politics and specific ones like /r/SandersForPresident and r/the_donald. If a sub is dedicated to discourse and discussion, great! If not, great! **This is the whole function and entire purpose of subreddits.**

 That is what would have happened to r/the_donald. Brigading (despite being against reddit rules) would have torn the sub apart. Most subs are in some way a ""safe space"". I mentioned this in my last comment. Subs are specific targets of content. What would happen if every sub had to allow content that was irrelevant to their interests?! Reddit wouldn't be what is it without subs and the ability to direct content. Are you arguing for anarchy? Where any content is allowed on any sub regardless of whether it fits its purpose?

They are claiming to be like /r/politics - open for dissent, but then they are silencing those that don't agree with that weeks safe space doctrine.

Why do their views deserve to be protected, when they so obviously wrong/immoral? Because we as a society have no perfect or objective standards by which to determine for political purposes whether or a type of speech is immoral, short of it inciting imminent violence. The will of the popular majority on any particular issue isn't good enough. Sure, holocaust denial seems like something that most society pretty widely accepts as false/immoral, but where does one draw the line? Should climate-denial be outlawed? Most Americans don't believe in evolution; should we be able to legislate against promoting/teaching it?

I was not trying to answer the question of whether or not Wikileaks was actively working with Russia. In fact, at the bottom of my post I point out that depending on your definition of ""trustworthy"" you may still consider Wikileaks to be trustworthy, since (at this time) our information suggests that they are a) not working together actively and b) still released true leaks.

However, *working together* is not logically equivalent to *linked to*. There is absolutely no doubt Wikileaks is linked to Russia. Documents stolen by Russia went to Wikileaks on behalf of Russian Intelligence, which means there is a chain of trusted groups/individuals that links Wikileaks and Russian intelligence.

If we had applied harsh censorship to this specific subject as Germany had, I believe this could have been avoided. And this revisionism becoming mainstream has had an extremely important real-world impact; our relations with our neighbors is strained in large part because of this. I hate the current political situation, being a military puppet of the United States while in petty disputes with the countries we should be working with. I have an immense amount of pride in my country for what we've accomplished since the war, but I envy Germany who managed to not only rebuild into a world power themselves, but also embraced the mistakes of their past and worked through them to create an extremely tight bond with its former enemies.  

I went off on a bit of a tangent, but that's why I think censorship has value when used carefully. It's true that there's a fine, fine line about legislating speech like this, and it's impossible to be perfectly objective, but if you don't try when the stakes are acceptably high, what should be a fringe, morally unacceptable position can eventually find its way accepted back into the society. Trusting society to self-police itself well is dangerous, when you consider the fact that society once already embraced these ideas enough to fight World War II in the first place.  

And with those thoughts in mind, I do think that advocating for the murder of political opponents crosses that fine line as something that is clearly morally objectionable enough to be censored.

There is no such thing as a government, just people, like me. And how do these people assert their power? More people, just like me, but with badges that say ""l'etat, c'est moi"". Perhaps that, then, is a good standard to hold myself to. I'll treat nazis the same way the police treat young black men who, again, are just more people -- that is to say, gun them down in the street.

The point is, ultimately, somebody has to stand up and say ""No more!"". The so called ""government"" has shown itself time and time again to be ultimately concerned with one thing, and one thing only: the preservation of it's own power. Why, then, would it even have a problem with fascism, or with genocide? Both are aimed to expand and consolidate state power, and therefore do not conflict with the goals of the state. So if not me, then who?

I would guess that your position is one of rule utilitarianism: that free speech can only be preserved if it is applied and adhered to universally. It's not a bad idea, and, in theory, I'm inclined to agree. The issue, though, is predicated on that last word ""universally"". Rule utilitarianism neccesitates that the rule, in this case ""free speech"" be applied universally, because any violation of that rule invalidates the whole thing. And -- and I do know I'm assuming here -- therein lies your objection. That if we say it is ok to violate a nazi's right of free speech, our right is lost. The problem with that is that ""free speech"" as a sacred principle has been violated again and again, and not equitably.

Essentially, we have almost universally acknowledged that the ""right"" of free speech comes with qualifications. The most common example is yelling ""fire!"" in a movie theater -- we know that it is speech, as an action, but it does not hold any merit as communication and poses a danger to others. To take that a step further, most people would acknowledge that organizing a lynch mob is *not* speech -- it is an incitement to violence. What, then, is the difference in trying to organize a group of people whose ultimate goal is ethnic cleansing? The time frame? Planning and organizing ethnic cleansing is not ""speech"". It is an incitement to violence​, and this incitement to violence is implicit in National Socialism.

The police don't do anything. The government seeks only to perpetuate its own power. So the only objection that remains is ""why me?"". The only answer I can proffer at this point is this: ""Why *not* me?""

And there are still enclaves in every major city in America for every cultural group you can think of.

Again, literally not. That NIGHT the top post of the sub was about how he was always a shady guy.

And if you guys think that he wanted immunity to say he had nothing, you guys don't understand the fundamental points behind immunity.

If he did nothing wrong, he has no need for immunity. If he asks for it, he needs to give them something in trade for it. If he gives them something and then goes on the stand and says something else, that immunity can and would be revoked as it is *always* conditional on what is said under oath matches what they were told to offer.

Yes, sometimes morally unacceptable views become mainstream and lead to bad cultural outcomes like imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, but I think that the rise of those societies usually coincides with government repression of dissenting views.

Letting the people set up shop in broad daylight legitimatizes their beliefs. It shows that it's an at least somewhat acceptable norm.

That is why I said ""I digress"". The basis of my argument is on the economic impact illegal aliens have in the US.

>Illegal immigrants are hurting american wages

As shown in the article I linked to you: the jobs occupied by illegal immigrants aren't filled by native citizens when they have the opportunity to. There is no ""american wage"" because they simply do not live near/don't choose to be employed in those shitty jobs. Sincerely, your premise is wrong. They aren't 'stealing jobs' or 'lowering wages'. These are jobs that, traditionally, never existed in the US because no one wants to do them. They are shit jobs, and when illegal aliens are suppressed from taking them, they stay empty. 

> sure agriculture prices will increase but you are strongly overestimating the impact. 

[Here](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/08/17/could-farms-survive-without-illegal-labor/the-costs-and-benefits-of-a-raise-for-field-workers) is an interesting article about it. In order to fill the jobs with American workers, we would have to pay them 3-4-5x the amount of an illegal alien. This would raise the cost to the American consumer by 15-20%. I'm not sure about you, but increasing the cost of already expensive fresh fruits and vegetables by 20% isn't affordable for most households, particularly for the aforementioned near-poverty line ones. This, of course, ignoring the fact that the costs to the farmers aren't just in the form of increased labor costs. They would have to start taking workplace safety and hours into serious consideration. Long story short, it would hammer some of the already hardest hit areas of our country. 

Simply, labor supply on a continental scale isn't elastic. It's taken decades for the supply and demands of various laborers and labor-sources to balance out. Any rapid adjustment to the system would have to take that cost into account. Can we really afford to fuck around with this petty crap? Like do you want to spend cool hundred billion dollars trying to iron out a matter that boils down to simple paper-work? 

More so; I don't argue with the value of temporary work visas. But it doesn't address the fact that we still have people who have no place to go. Very literally, what is the point of taking a hard-working dude, who's been here for 35 years and dumping him at the border of a country he hasn't seen in ever, with zero connections or resources? Why fuck with shit like that? Now we have even more destitute people who need assistance. 

I understand your points. I get that it's a shitty spot to find ourselves in. Very much ignoring the human element of this equation: our unemployment stands at 7.5 million people. There are approximately that many employed illegal immigrants. You tell me how we facilitate, cheaply and efficiently, the transfer of those jobs to people who, very obviously, live in completely geographically distinct areas of the country. How do we do that?

And again: this has nothing to do with race. I don't think you're racist. In fact, no one who's serious about the subject on the left thinks that people like yourself are racist. You want to secure the country. We do too. We want everyone to pay takes, you do too. We all want our country to be as economically successful as possible and we want our government to spend our hard earned money in the most efficient way possible. Working forward from that standard I hope we can agree on a couple basic tenants:

1) Means of legal immigration must be expanded to address the needs of our economy and to reduce the allure of illegal immigration. 

2) Our borders must be protected from criminal elements, even at the expense of normal people looking to immigrate illegally. 

3) We must secure our economic foundations and find a way of removing the black market of labor that illegal aliens operate in via a non-disruptive naturalization channel. 

If that seems like a reasonable middle ground to you, then I'd love to talk about detailed policy. It also happens to represent the majority democratic opinion on the subject. ",False,False,False,166847,17728,1416264286.0,False,True

All cultures cause conflict when they come together.  
All of them.

English and Irish and French and Spanish and Italian and Greek and Swedish and Swiss and Russian and Portuguese and Danish and Chinese and Japanese and Indian and Indonesian and  Australian and South African and Moroccan and Egyptian and Iranian and Iraqi and Turkish and Mexican and Canadian and Bolivian and Brazilian and Uruguayan and etc etc etc. All of them came to American, have retained much of their culture, assimilated much of other cultures and become America.

People from every Muslim nation on the planet have emigrated to the US and they have lived here in the same community as me and you, in the same city and county and state as me and you, and they have done so without causing a net negative in your life at all.

Huh... How about that...

Read critically. *Your* culture doesn't determine *my* laws and *my* culture doesn't determine *your* laws. I would imagine someone who is seemingly so versed as you are in the assimilation of America would have recognized the paraphrased statement, since it comes from probably the most important era of our country's history.

It was spoken by Henry Clay on the Senate Floor during a speech when they were deciding the Compromise of 1850. Maybe you'd know the full quote better?

""The disparate cultures of the Southern States, from Louisiana to Virginia and even my home of Kentucky do not determine the laws of the North, just as the social constructs of the Northern States of Pennsylvania and New York do not determine the laws of the South. We are here, in this Great Experiment, to show the world that men from cultures from every end of the map can learn from each other, and grow together to form a more perfect Union. For if we do not or can not, the Union will fall.

Meaning? America is a land where all cultures not only can come together, but should come together. That was true in the 18th century when we fought for Independence, that was true in the 19th century when we fought to preserve the Union, and it was true in the 20th century when we fought to stop a man and his followers from wiping out other cultures they deemed ""incompatable"".

Lesse, this has been, from start to finish, a conversation specifically about how you feel that Islam is incompatable with America. Do you really want to try and tell me that this whole time that you have been focused on Islam that you meant that one singular statement, without qualification, to be about multiple cultures?

Even cultures that are already a long standing thread of the fabric of America? 

Okay, kid. Okay.

>And no, I did not bring up ""artwork or architecture"" because I can't exactly picture either of those creating conflict. I was using an example of an incompatibility of culture. I'm not sure what is so hard to understand about that. 

You don't think k the artwork of Islamic countries could create conflict?

Do me a favor, Google ""Islamic Artwork"" and tell me what you DONT see. And I'm not talking about Mohammed, either, although that is an offshoot of this.

*There are no people.* It's not just the image of Mohammed that is forbidden, it is the image of any man or woman because they believe it it an affront to Allah to try and duplicate his perfect creation, man.

And even beyond that, as you see, you are keen on highlighting the *differences* in people. I'm keen on highlighting the *similarities*.

And I believe that this is the crux of this whole thing here. I don't see Muslims as all that different from anyone else. They may believe in God a different way, and that may make other uncomfortable, and it may scare them, as it has made you uncomfortable and as it has scared you, but it doesn't make me uncomfortable. It doesn't scare me. Because as more Muslim men, women and children come to America, just as more Mexican men, women and children come to America, and more people from China and India and Pakistan and Europe and Africa come to America, we and they will do as we have done for 200+ years. We will come together and learn from each other and grow with each other and become better than we were because we are here, together.

So you can keep on trying to convince me that your version of what you think is American culture is now perfect and should be closed off, but I'll never believe that.

No, but up until then in Germany, they were just scapegoats, it wasn't the first nor last time that would happen, and never before, in Western Europe, had more then scapegoating been done.

If I understand this correctly, which I am unsure about because this is worded as if a toddler wrote it, that is more then holding a belief, that is taking a treasonous action.

Practicing a belief that is too far contradictory to the law is very different from holding a belief that is.
