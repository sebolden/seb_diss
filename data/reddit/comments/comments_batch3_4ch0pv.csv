No.

You have begun the slippery slope. Actually, you are well on your way down it. Your front page has already sunk to the quality of digg and facebook. Some smaller specialized subreddits still live, but even those are not the 'bastions of free speech' they once were.

Heres the canary in the coal mine : Nigger. Will I get banned? Probably. Will reddit die a long slow death and become just crap? Equally as likely.

For those that dont know, check out voat.co, where free speech and unsafe ideas still flow the way they used to on reddit. To anyone that 'likes reddit the way it is now' keep your fat titties here then.

Personally perfectly fine with all of that. But then again I don't have *that* much of a mind for privacy, so others may or may not be pissed.

 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on comments, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.

242,szj6l,cy0m11u,t3_3tlcil,t3_3tlcil,1450236526.0,1,"Two thoughts: 

1) Sharing of information should (tend to) attract more ad revenue, which helps pay for the technical work necessary to maintain operations and scale the capabilities of the site. Even those positions that support the organization behind the site but don't actually design or code any site infrastructure, e.g. the sales team, create jobs that would otherwise not exist.

They are indirectly paid by advertisers, at least in part. If not for these advertisers paying more in return for our information, then who would pony up the cash to attract the miracle workers requested in the Reddit job postings?

(It is my personal experience that coding server-side database functionality and selling things are difficult tasks; hence, my use of the term ""miracle workers."")

And just because Quora pays staff without relying on ads doesn't mean Reddit shouldn't. I've contributed sporadically to Quora but have found it to be a hive-mind of Ivy League elitists and West Coast programmers; whereas Reddit is much more diverse in terms of viewpoint.

(I'm sure the typical Quoran sees us a ""bunch of Muppets,"" but that's why we're Redditers and not wasting our time on Quora -- for the most part, as some overlap surely exists in some sub-Reddits.)

2) If you're Hell-bent on dissuading advertisers from getting your Reddit information, then find some way to prevent Reddit from hiring a decent sales team (who would otherwise bait advertisers); analytics experts (who would otherwise show the sales execs usage and visitor metrics); and machine-learning engineers (who would otherwise help Reddit serve more scientifically targeted advertising).

On the latter note, who pays Reddit staff? Advertising revenue alone surely cannot cut it, as the dozen or so Reddit vacancies -- although without stated salaries -- likely pay between $40,000 (for an account assistant) to upwards of $80,000 (for any of the engineering roles).

Include the non-vacant jobs, and the Reddit payroll easily approaches $1 million. Who pays Reddit this much, year after year?",False,False,False,-24,6,1450234477.0,False,False

I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

* How does hashing help to identify spam and abuse? Isn't hashing related to security? As in, for example I'd hash a user's password/ data to encrypt it and maybe add a salt value (preferably via CRNG or atleast some sort of not-easily repeatable RNG algorithm) to encrypt said person's data. How does hashing help in that regard at all? (I'm not very bright, and I've just started going through Cryptography, so please bear with me here). Technically you could encrypt/compress this data (IP/general user data) via hashing - which obviously helps because of reduced storage space at the cost of increased clock cycles, but how does that help identify spam and abuse? 

* Secondly, who decides what is abuse and what is not. On what parameters. For example: say I have a completely different opinion about some random topic, and some OP/ some user said something that really ticks me off, and I call him/her a fucking idiot. What happens then.  How is it treated differently from some some dude/dudette hounding a person over reddit/other places.

>One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter.

* Reddit acquired Alien Blue. Reddit needed to transfer Alien Blue to the Reddit Apple account.
* We re-launched Alien Blue under the Reddit developer account, but unfortunately, Apple has a policy that doesn't allow an iCloud transfer of data from two developer accounts. 
* The only option we had was to allow any/all users to upgrade to Pro for free for iPhone app and to remove Pro altogether for iPad, with plans of rolling the iPad app into a universal app for both iPad and iPhone. This is still the plan, but the launch date for the universal app hasn't been set as of yet.

This is useful because later on you can check if someone/something is the same as the previous thing, even without knowing what that previous thing was.

*User control over advertisement frequency, ability to suppress ads that are unwanted*

*Consideration for data usage, as many users are affected by data caps*



I'm not sure how this would play out, but would it be possible to allow users to set a preference for advertising frequency, or the ability to ""squelch"" certain ads? I'm a cord-cutter, and I am quite wary of excessive and obsessive advertisement through any form of media. It would be great to have some semblance of control over what I see and how often I see it, without needing to be cautious about the context of my comments. It's a big part of what drives me away from websites, or tv stations, or radio; not having some degree of control and being force-fed information that I really do not care to experience.

Additionally, how will this play out for mobile users, or any user who has an Internet Service Provider that imposes a data cap? Will the ads be primarily text based, image links, videos, some combination of all? If ads are to be served up, is there some consideration for the data usage, perhaps a maximum allowable file size based on what medium the advertisement is being served through?

I'm not saying that they will, but they shouldn't be able to do so in the first place.

Remember when spez said that they were going to add a ""send to admins"" button or something like that to PMs so you can report harassment?

If they already have the technical ability to read them, then isn't that button then useless?

Also, a few paragraphs of the privacy policy state metadata collection is done.

The types of metadata mentioned are fine, but the ones that are not (it is implied that they exist through the use of the word ""including""), could be *anything*, and we'd never know.

Let me give you a real-world example :

I'm the NSA. I can't really *legally* spy on your phone calls without getting a proper legal warrant and such official documents.

So, instead, I can get *meta*data about your phone calls:

* Your phone number

* Name of the caller (you)

* Name of the person you're calling

* His or her phone number

* What time you called him or her.

I'm not sure how most of that information would make the ads any better. Aside from them loading faster and not having your data go through a bunch of 3rd parties that may abuse it. Really Ghostery helps people who have websites keep everything under control.

Can you please speak to why there is no ability to comment on the iPad ads and why they are rolled into the feed vs. just at the top and disappear once we scroll?

This strikes me as a move to a FB-like feed inventory model that can dramatically increase the number of potential impressions.  The removal of comments from the AlienBlue ads seems like a direct attempt at stifling the inevitable negative comments, and the fact that vote counts are hidden solidifies that.

I realize this comes across as somewhat of an attack, but we've discussed various ad-tech-related matters before and I know you know your shit.  Would really like a straight business answer on these decisions as they are pretty blatant to anyone who pays attention.

If reddit wanted strictly the same computer, they would need access to some other value, maybe a MAC address or something.

1. Implementing a way for people to discover competing subreddits, that mods can't block.

No, it's not. 

There are probably many thousands of private messages sent via Reddit every day. The admins would not read *all* of them! In fact, they probably wouldn't read *any* of them in the normal course of events. Why would they? That's a lot of reading time, and they've got better things to do than read your messages.

But, if you clicked on a ""send to admins"" button, that would inform the admins that you *want* them to read a particular message - because, otherwise, they would ignore it just like the thousands and thousands of other messages they ignore all the time. Therefore, a button like that would be useful.

> We aren't told exactly all the kinds of metadata that they're going to collect, and as a result they could be collecting anything they wanted to collect, and we'd never know.

Commenting: We have always had the ability for advertisers to turn off comments  on ads. Previously on reddit.com and now in the apps. This is nothing new. The comments on mobile do tend to trend more negatively and less about the content of the ad and a general distaste for mobile ads. So advertisers tend to turn comments off on mobile ads because of this.

Feed vs fixed to the top: On reddit.com there is potential for 3 ads on any given page load (the Sponsored Headline, 300x250, and the 300x100). So the total number of ads per session can be quite high. But, on mobile there's not really a concept of ""pages"", it's more of a never ending stream of content. If we just had one ad at the top of our mobile feed, it would be extremely hard to make enough revenue to justify the cost of running Alien Blue. We need to be able to put more than one ad, especially since mobile users scroll _a lot_ more than desktop users. One ad at the top would never be seen. Even with 3 ads per stream load, we still won't be getting the same number of ad impressions that we would get from the same user on desktop. Mobile monetization is hard. With more and more internet traffic going towards mobile, it's important that we figure out a business strategy that respects user experience & privacy, but also makes enough revenue to keep Reddit healthy and thriving.

People who think that way can't be reached with any form of persuasion so the monkey may as well get his banana. Life's too short to fight all battles and I'm not fond of swimming upstream. 

I mean I think we have to acknowledge from the ground level that we invited EVERYONE to the conversation. You can't do that if you want to maintain a standard. The Bay Area of San Fransisco found that out in 69. The punk music scene found that out in the 90s. StumbleUpon! found that out the moment it opened its doors to IE users.

It is the elephant in the room that increasingly is being ignored only by management. Moderators should not be deputized lone wolf authorities on a web site that prides itself over its own discourse. 

I would also add that I don't think your echo chamber problem is going to be addressed. I'm in advertising, and I can tell you the single most effective tool to sell a product is to congratulate the customer. Reddit is taking the facebook approach: Isolate the user from dissenting view points to better identify markets for targeted advertising, and to keep their egos ramped up with self-congratulatory horse excrement so they're in a purchasing mood.

There's a component of that in what I'm doing here, but at the same time I can't escape the seriousness of my statements, I am not playing a bullshitter's devil's advocate.  I think this is a serious discussion where all valid arguments need to be recognized, not ignored, whether they are arguments against our chosen position or not, and I promise I'm trying to do that with respect :)

You ask:

> *What are the benefits, exactly?*

I say:

>> *and people have a chance to see where you stand*

> ***Wow, creepy.***

Just the other day, I responded at some length to a person who turned out to be a habitual troll.  This was pointed out kindly by someone else, and the troll responded by asking me if I was going to believe a day old account.  So I went and looked.  The brand new account had several long and very obviously sincere posts on other subs, serious topics.  The troll was a long time user that posted almost nothing but one line, ambiguous and mildly inflammatory and/or confusing statements; a shit stirrer, and maybe not so bright.

So I ask you, was it creepy that I took my only available means to try to figure out where these two posters were coming from, so I could figure out who I might best trust, and how not to be tricked?  I don't think that was creepy, I think it was just the right amount of accountability.  I got to see what other people let me see (they could use separate accounts but they didn't), and what I saw said something very useful about where they were coming from.  I also got the impression that the day-old poster was not new to reddit, knew exactly what they were doing, and was making use of the free availability of having multiple accounts.

Allowing posting history to be public allows others the right to form their own opinions, and sometimes that is invaluable, especially in a community where trolls, pranksters, abusers and assholes could easily abuse the privacy as badly as they can abuse the ability to look at other's history.  If you say something to me, I can look at your history, or lack of history, and make up my own mind how much I'm willing to trust you.  Without this, there would be no way to see how much shit someone was hiding.

> *People can never change their minds, never have a change of heart, never reconsider their positions. They should be tarnished, branded for life. Also, what they post gives clear intention, death of the author and all that. They never play devils advocate, for example. They never explore a topic before deciding it isn't for them.*

You raise extremely valid points there.  OTOH, I've changed my mind many times, been wrong, embarrassed myself for sure, lost arguments, been an asshole and a troll and a contrarian... I've done it all, and I've admitted as much publicly.  If you had several days, you could read my posting history and see it all in full gory glory.  If some asshole decides to do that, and wants to hold me accountable for something, and I disagree, then I'll think they are an asshole, and maybe I'll just have to ignore them and the shit they want to say about me.  Or make another account and start fresh and anonymous again.  I can live with my own behavior, or walk away from it.  And in extreme cases, I can even go and delete any past posts that I'm really afraid of (I've never done that).

> *Why not put down your full name and postal address? Or is that too much neck?*

Yes, that would be too much neck.  Even after five years of posting history, you would have an extremely hard time figuring out who I am, because I chose to be anonymous, and that is one of the extremely powerful aspects of Reddit, a crucial part of the freedom it gives us, that enables all the personal experimentation you so rightly mention and cherish.  I very fully agree, we need the ability to speak and discuss things without being exposed.  But it's a practical balance, and Reddit strikes that balance simply: you can have multiple user names freely and with no expectation of identifying yourself for real, and you can delete your posts if you want them gone.  For all we know, Obama and Putin are having fantastic discussions over in r/politics, and nobody but them will ever know, including each other.

But I recognize there is tension here, because ***in practice*** you end up with a single main user account, and you want to stick with it for various reasons.  It becomes inconvenient to switch users a lot, and you miss features if you are gilded on a main account but not a secondary account.  It would have been nice to be able to have a single master account, with multiple user names (personas) that would not be inter-visible except to the master account.  I think Reddit probably wasn't thinking that far ahead back when it was created, and it would be a radical restructuring of the system to change its core user account mechanisms now.  I expect we'll be stuck with the present choice, which is to make separate accounts and live with it.

> *I don't suppose you have any relatives, that every time you go home for Christmas, have to endlessly drag some stupid shit you did once in the past to introduce to the next person who dares to join your ""family"".*

If you don't know already, Joshua Goldberg was this guy who had multiple provocateur accounts on loads of forums.

He wrote a bit on Stormfront telling people to brigade r\/europe and other subs on reddit. They always point to it as evidence that r\/europe is being actively brigaded by Stormfront and they need to heavily censor everything there. 

Anyway, he had a reddit account called u\/european88 which he used to constantly post anti-Semitic and racist crap on r/european with.

He was arrested a few weeks back because he had one Muslim provocateur account on another forum that he went too far with and actually incited terrorism. Turned out he was a Jewish kid. He's wikipedia famous now:

Think about how mail (regular physical mail) gets routed - you need a destination address, and the postal system needs to know how to route from your address to that address.

It's the same with computers. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is just a destination on a network, and just like the postal system you need one on both ends.

Now, in the real world, addresses follow a pretty loose format and almost never change because they represent a physical location entity.

With the internet though, that's not the case. Each device needs an IP to communicate, and devices don't necessarily stay in one place. Plus there's the problem of there only being 4-billion possible IP values under IPv4, of which we've already run out. And of course your ISP can only assign you an IP they control - much like how you can't give your house an address belonging to a completely different state and city.

All that really matters is that the IP doesn't change out from under active connections (or at least, doesn't change from the point of view of the two machines talking to each other).

So if you A) know the IP of the system and B) also know what *time* that IP was used, it could be enough to identify a specific machine, even if something else ends up with that IP later. It's more complicated than that of course, especially with NAT becoming more and more common to conserve IPv4 addresses, but that's the simple version.

One weakness of hashes is that, if there's only a few values anyone would try to hash, you can just try all of them until something works.  To help with this, there are special hashing functions (cryptographic hashes) designed to take a lot of computing work, so brute forcing like that is harder.

If a wheel displays zero and you throw a 5 in its funnel, the display changes to 5 (0+5). Throw in a 3, the display shows 8 (5+8). Now, if you throw in another 5, you should get 13, but the display only has one digit, so it throws away the 1 and displays 3.

Now, imagine you have a number with 12 digits (like an IP address). You take the first three digits and throw the first one in the first funnel, the second in the second funnel and the third in the third funnel. Then you do the same with the second three digits and the third and fourth.

The displays will show you three digits that, seemingly, have nothing to do with the original IP.

Have you guys considered testing additional business models for mobile? My fear is that as the requirement to generate more and more mobile revenue creeps up, the walls over what Reddit is ok with and what it is not will topple and we'll likely be seeing high RPM auto-play video ads every 4-6 items ala FB.

In this case, the interests of the publisher seem somewhat misaligned with the interest of the user, but it might be the only viable model, so the lesser of all evils.

It's like, from a business and ad industry side, I totally get it.  As an incredibly loyal user of Reddit for almost a decade however, I can't help but loathe it.  Part of that is because I love Reddit due to its lack of ads.

Would you say there is a clear threshold for what is considered too high of a mobile feed frequency?

Also, is your stance on retargeting still that it is verboten? The comments higher up talk about the steps Reddit takes to limit tracking, but then goes on to say Reddit uses GA. Google does leverage data gained from its GA coverage to inform targeting, and they can match many people down to the name/phone number/address level.  That worries me quite a bit more than Reddit having the data TBH.

That leads to the question of what the official stance is on the privacy implications for users of Google having that data?  Obviously many folks like me run NoScript or other blockers, but that is conveniently impossible in apps these days, and I am left wondering what Reddit feels its duty is to its users, and how far that extends to the third parties it exposes them to.

It sounds like they are mainly storing IPs to fight spam. 

If that's the case and if they can manage it, they could structure it so that IP checks are near last in line. They can check a ton of other stuff first, and if enough of them flag that it *might* be a spammer, then they check against the IP hashes. (after all, if it's *probably* a spammer an extra few ms or even tens of ms of time on the request isn't going to hurt all that much for such a small and somewhat shady subset of users)

And by using an scrypt style hash and targeting 5ms (which is doable if they weed out the vast majority of requests that they are pretty damn sure aren't spam) they could then verify if a user's IP is on the spam list as a last resort.

At that point it would take commodity hardware about 250 days to generate a full rainbow table (assuming your earlier calc of 50 days / ms is correct). They can then rotate the salts every 100 days and get the same level of spam-fighting they do now but with the added benefit of not storing any IP addresses (and the added downside of more CPU usage).

And if they have a few **really** bad spammers (say like 1% of IPs cause like 80% of the spam), then they could do something cute like store a blacklist of un-hashed IP addresses and add IP addresses to it only when they hit a trigger of something like x thousand spam requests per the last 100 days.

However, this has several things going on behind the scenes for something the scale of reddit. First, sharing the logic for when something is hard delete vs soft delete means your system has to record when the user clicked the button. The delete command may not be immediate. What if your servers are lagging and one recieved a hard delete and the other, by the time it is ready, recieved it as a soft delete? Timing issues happen when you have time based events and these are the bugs that give most programmers nightmares. 

Second, indexing and materialized views are constructed on the fly for optimization. Think of this like a cache or the impulse buy section of a store - everything is there nice and easy for you to see and access. Updating this isn't a good idea. Instead, you update the source and rebuild these indexes and views on a timer, or after a certain number of events. This means our edit function is already good enough to do what we want it to.

I was suggesting a binary choice. Approve the post or don't. Don't silence it.

The front page will continue to rotate and people will get their say without being down voted into oblivion for a ""fascist"", ""that's just wrong"" or ""eww! gross!"" opinion or expression. Getting rid of the DV button will strip brigaders of a weapon they have had for far too long. I would go the extra mile and say peoples comment history shouldn't be accessed by anyone but the user themselves. The DV button swamps the bad as well as the good and if you do care for opinion (as you say you do) and expression you wouldn't want it to be swamped by easily nerve stricken people where their emotion comes before any reasonable discussion. Comment history also gives brigaders ammo to pointlessly attack without engaging in proper debate or without being part of a healthy community of their own. Instead we have syndicates of political nerve bags destroying other communities and individuals because feelings. What kind of philosophy is that?

People should have a right to be offended, be an arsehole or anything else while also being able to express themselves.

Also there are special types of cookies that can be read from one site to another so that would also be a way for one site to share with Facebook.

The reality is, internet ads are big business and they have figured out a bunch of ways to identify who you are by your browsers unique information. A 3 party site partners with some sites to store the data and with other sites to sell relevant ads, all without exposing your identity.

But there is practically no chance of any real data from one tabs page making its way to another tab.

Actually, this is only part of the truth. There *is* a difference between a moderator removal and a user deletion. With a moderator removal, the only thing that happens is that the removed comment is hidden from the subreddit it was posted in; the comment is still visible on the user's history page. The removed comment is also still visible to all moderators of the subreddit it was posted in. With a user deletion, the comment is also gone from their history page, and is no longer visible to moderators. 

While all comments - including moderator-removed and user-deleted comments - are stored on Reddit's servers, there are differences between a moderator removal and a user deletion in how and where those comments are visible to moderators.

By continuously salting, they no longer have that ability to compare requests from a given IP over the last 100 days so they might as well not store IPs at all (not that that's a bad thing).

When you try to lookup an IP you won't know which salt to use to get the same result.

So you would need to ""group"" IPs by certain categories that have nothing to do with the IP itself and give each group its own salt.

As a shitty example, you use the account's username as the salt.

That way you can easily re-hash any incoming IP addresses and get the same result, but not have the same salt for every person.

It's not quite ""one salt per IP"" but it's close enough to make a ""full"" hashtable impossible. 

That doesn't solve the issue for targeted attacks though.

This is my point of it not being the answer.  It will only push an equal reaction the other way.

As a moderator, I'm not really sure this happened. Look in /r/ModSupport which was suppose to be a communication channel between mods and admins. The majority of the topics (which are questions) have no admin response. I have a couple topics in there from weeks ago with no admin comment. I sent a modmail to that subreddit 7 days ago just asking if the subreddit was still planned to be a communication tool between us mods and admins. I never got a reply. I'm losing count of all the ""having major spam issues"" questions in /r/ModSupport that receive no admin reply; a single response would be enough. It seems to have fallen to as little admin participation as /r/modtalk gets.

I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.

A year ago, reddit hired a ""Community Engineer"" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this. Modmail is one of the most important things for us moderators; even having an acknowledge/resolved button would be fantastic.

/r/snoogaming (created by an admin) remains abandoned by the admins with us moderators trying to pick up the slack. I had to pull teeth like no tomorrow to get a basic answer on what the future of this was from an admin perspective. This was before you returned though I think.

I barely hear anything from the admins nowadays. I get replies on /r/reddit.com PMs when I contact them about ban evasion, but I got replies like that 2 years ago so things are as they were.

In the same light, AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water. There is an error topic [stickied](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/3zrckp/bug_i_am_getting_this_error_almost_daily_since/) and has been for 3 weeks. No fix nor admin comments in the last 20 days. Not only that, but with reddit.com owning the app now the admins developing that app don't seem to be staying on top of their own reddit changes. I don't believe the new subreddit rule system (which was in beta for a while) is even implemented on the app? And as a moderator, subreddit rules being front and center on mobile is very important to us. If reddit is developing a new system like that, don't you think it should be implemented into AlienBlue in parallel?

I'm not trying to pick on individual admins, scenarios or people. I am trying to show a pattern that is not changing. reddit is a *professional business*. It's very concerning.

So, a user can get a message banning them from r/durpadurp because the mods of r/durpadurp noticed that said user also posted or commented on something in r/hurpahurp, and r/hurpahurp just makes them sad.

I've got a question about inactive top mods. Now there are 5500 comments in this thread already, so if a similar question has been asked before, my sincerest apologies.

To the point. I moderate /r/KerbalSpaceProgram, and we recently had a discussion about inactive mods. We have a top mod who hasn't done *anything* for at least as long as I moderate the place (1 year). No activity in modmail, nothing in the modlog, nothing. I know you said that if a top mod goes rogue, the community can start another community of their own, but we're talking about a 120k sub subreddit about Kerbal Space Program, called /r/KerbalSpaceProgram. It's not like there's a better name for a community than that. Besides, there is *so* much work in that place that it's ridiculous. It's not like I don't trust the top mod, but if he did were to go rogue, and throw all other mods out, there's no way in the world that we'd be able to recover.

Are there any plans that would allow us to remove inactive mods, even if they would 'outrank' us in seniority?

I don't know if you know this but there's a little subreddit known as /r/undelete. It's a subreddit made with the express purpose of reposting deleted posts from other subreddits. It used to be just the stray post with barely a hundred upvotes and completely off topic. Nowadays it's more common to see posts from the front page on there than ever. 

What I want to know is, whether you think a simple site wide rule being implemented to determine whether a post can be deleted should be put in place? A lot of these posts are reaching 2000-3000 upvotes and are at the top of their subreddits before being deleted. That doesn't sound right to me.

Reddit is a community driven system and if posts are being removed for mostly arbitrary reasons(I concede that some break rules but even then would argue against deletion) it feels as though we as users are losing control of our communities. 

The mods need to be able to police a subreddit but when the mods are clearly going against the wishes of the community it stands to reason that their power to police needs to be limited if not revoked.  

Just a simple thought that I feel most on the undelete subreddit would agree with. If you don't answer I understand but I feel this is Reddit's biggest problem at the moment. The site is being led not by its users but by its moderators and that's not what Reddit and communities like it have ever been about. 

Edit: The fact that this post has gone up and down as much as it has is frightening. I'm not asking for something absurd. I'm asking for the users of a subreddit to decide what should be on their subreddit. The mods should have one simple role and that's to ensure nothing illegal is posted.

My political leaning shouldn't be cause for someone to ban me from a support subreddit, for example. Mods shouldn't be able to use bots to auto-ban users that fall into certain categories (ala /r/OffMyChest, etc).

Meanwhile, the new changes reddit has been pushing out in the past 6 months have been terrible. The rules/report stuff is an unmitigated disaster from a UX standpoint, the designs for mobile headers look like they were done by a high school design student, and reddit *still* has the bug where you click a link from google on mobile and it takes you straight to m.reddit.com rather than the deep link you were trying to get to (despite it being posted multiple times that this bug is fixed).

>Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

>2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

>Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

>Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

>I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

>We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

>This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

>As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

>–Steve

>edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out https://www.reddit.com/jobs.

You won't really. We've improved here, and we're continuing to invest in it, but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working.

> A year ago, reddit hired a ""Community Engineer"" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this.

I'm sad to say that although we invested quite a bit, my favorite feature [didn't work out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/42o57u/modmailtoemail_beta_closing/).

With all due respect to the mod, he or she was either too lazy to view the link I posted or just felt like lying. Because before I posted that evening I searched, the article had not been posted before, and no article had been posted abut refugees for 15 hours. This was strange because it was a very hot issue for a few days during the summer when the crisis began being reported by every news agency. I figured worldnews deleted every single post involving migrants and refugees going back 15 hours. I mentioned that my post was from a major news organization and it wasn't opinion, it was reporting on the situation. I never got any response after that.

That says mods->admins to me. As in the mods reach out and receive replies from admins. I understand admins make submissions in there, but we've always had /r/modnews for that (which includes beta testing news). An admin making a submission is admin->mods, which we've always had.

Perhaps I just missed seeing that. Was that mentioned in /r/ModSupport? If not, a simply admin reply saying that would have quelled all those repeat topics across /r/ModSupport and /r/ModTalk.

>>  but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working
    
> Uh,  what? This is not what was promised to mods months ago as there was specifically talk about tools for mods to better deal with brigading. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider your answer and write something that is actually an answer? 

To continue on this track, your response doesn't make sense to begin with. You can't solve an issue top down when you are struggling to find a definition for it. Ideas about what exactly is a brigade vary (and as far as I can tell you guys never really asked around properly as well). So why not give mods the tools that allow them roughly see how many people are coming from outside the subreddit to posts, how many from outside reddit, how many are actually subscribers, etc and then based on that set limits on what those people can or can't do. 

That would be one idea, which isn't new btw. /u/relic2279 proposed something similar [over 9 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/31ur5x/do_you_think_brigading_is_a_real_issue/cq64afe). 

In any case, I wouldn't have so much of an issue with all of this if it didn't seem like you are purposely ignoring the issues at hand. In fact, it almost seems like you are arguing **against moderators being able to do any moderating**. In this same thread you said some empty line about [not liking to ban users from their communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/czfegi7) while ignoring the fact that trolls, etc are **not part of the community**. To me this entire thread feels like you are trying to appease a vocal minority that sees these sorts of posts as a perfect platform to complain about not being able to do their trolling and other unwanted behaviour. 

I don't know, but it almost feels like you are trying to actively pin things on us (moderators). Saying things that make the admins sound better to the censorship crowd and effectively slapping mods on the wrist for even thinking that we can ban people from our subs. 

Is this because you are trying to distance yourself from all the drama? But does that mean you need to crucify the volunteers that do the majority of the work? Trying to keep them just enough appeased by some token modtools that are much much less than what was promised months ago just after the blackouts? 

I am saying token modtools because some of them seem to be intentionally crippled as well. Muting is all nice and dandy but next to useless when users start to message mods individually or set a timer and come back after three days to continue with the abuse. Meanwhile we are told to not engage them where in many case it looks like that the action of muting itself is seen as engaging them...

Muting users has done essentially the same thing as banning them has - it ultimately tells them their behavior is unacceptable, and encourages them to reach out in modmail to discuss the situation with us further. 90% of the time, this results in them sending hateful messages to use that are full of abuse. We are then told to mute them in modmail, and they are back in 72 hours to abuse us some more. We have gone to the community team to report these users, and are told completely mixed answers. In some cases, we are told that by merely messaging the user to stop abusing us in modmail, we are engaging them and thus nothing can be done. In other cases, we are told that since we didn't tell them to stop messaging us, nothing can be done.

You say that you want to improve moderator relations, but these new policies have only resulted in us fielding *more* abuse. It has gotten so bad in /r/science, that we have resorted to just banning users with automod and not having the automated reddit system send them any more messages, as the level of venomous comments in modmail has gotten too high to deal with.

Yeah, I see *""If you don't like how we do things, then why don't you start your own sub and run that as you see fit?""* as a generally predictable response during those situations. It's a great catch phrase for these types of mods because it absolves them of their responsibilities, allows them to dodge the questions posed to them, and reflects the accountability back onto the user, kinda like a *""be the change you wish to see in the world""*.

To this point, that's almost been a snarky, backhanded pejorative of sorts, because- aside from one instance that I can think of- it's universally known to be a fools errand to try and build up a /r/boogereaters2 to any measurable value while /r/boogereaters has 800,000 subscribers. The boogereater market is cornered, especially since /r/boogereaters became a default sub last September.

2665,6r3jq,czfilgc,t1_czfevu2,t3_434h6c,1454011959.0,240,"Here's the problem.

Just because they're a mod does not mean *they own that community.* There are tons of communities on Reddit that predate the mod being added (and then adding all of his or her like-minded shitty friends so they can control everything with an iron fist).

So either the original mods never go AWOL and have to constantly keep their mods in check or everything spirals out of control. It happens over and over and usually ends with another alt-sub becoming the next Rome that will end in fire the same way in a few years. You can't say you haven't seen that happen.

I've said it before (to ZERO reply--including directly e-mailing you) and I'll say it again: The solution to bad mods is to make all mod powers pseudo powers. Mods can delete anything they want, but all actions are logged and publically viewable, and any user can simply ""view this page without mod changes.""

So now NOBODY can drum up false support of ""they're censoring me!"" which they use to create a rift in the community. And nobody can run around deleting good, sourced, comments because they disagree. If a mod community has clearly separate ideals than the community they manage, it will become very obvious.

Hiding from the rift between mods and community doesn't *fix* it. It only covers it up and creates further dissent. The entire Pao thing was a rift that was allowed to flourish because of this long-standing Reddit policy of ""if we just ignore it, it'll go away."" You can't solve two opposing sides by pretending they're not different. You only solve it with honest discussion and understanding which can only happen when both sides believe the other is playing fairly. When mods can delete anything they don't like, the rift continues because people *have to wonder* whether they're getting all the facts. When there is actual transparency, *there is no doubt.*

When someone thinks ""mods are censoring!"" in a thread, then clicks ""show all unflitered content"" and only sees a bunch of racist posts, it immediately improves their perceptions of the mods.

I'm not going to name the subreddits, but a quick google of 'why was I banned' or 'banned from 'subreddit' will reveal them, and I suspect you know already. 

I've said this before in other subs: Reddit is not Tumblr (or any other blog site).

To wit: Subreddits are not blogs. A Blog is 'owned' (at least operated) by a single user or handful of users to broadcast their content to an audience at large. 

It's a radio station, set to broadcast, and occasionally take callers from listeners out there in the comments section.

A Subreddit is a container for speech. It is not, and should not be treated as, a broadcast platform for the personal views of the moderator(s) in charge. 

It's *entire purpose* is to 'take callers', and the callers largely talk to each other about the subject(s) at hand. The moderator suggests a subject, and then, aside from enforcing basic rules, *gets the hell out of the way*.

Put yet another way:

If I run a Subreddit dedicated to, let's say ""Transformers"" and you come in and constantly harass posters and carry on about how *stupid* Transformers is and how utterly worthless everyone posting in the Transformers Sub is, maybe, after multiple warnings, I should ban or silence your username. You were actively disrupting the conversation.

What's *actually* happening, is something far more sinister. You visit the Transformers subreddit and find yourself unable to post or even reply. That's odd, you've never even been here before (or you have but respected the rules), so what gives? 

Turns out myself or a bot I made saw that you posted something and/or commented on a Subreddit dedicated to Go-Bots, and I banned you, not for being a disruptive user, but because *I personally think Go-Bots are stupid and obviously I don't want YOUR KIND here, Go-Bot filth!*

In scenario B, which is what's actually happening here on Reddit, the Mod should be corrected, and if needed, removed -- and the subreddit's users prompted to vote on a a replacement Mod(s), because I was silencing your potential speech due to something you said elsewhere that's plainly none of my business. 

Hopefully my example here isn't too muddled. I'm trying real hard to provide to anyone reading a solid example of what's going on, without having to wade into the whole SJW slogfest. ",False,False,False,57109,704,1327325140.0,False,False

I understand what you're saying, but respectfully disagree. 

A user should be able to post to any Subreddit he/she/it wishes without worry that mods of other Subreddits will ban them.

Now, if someone comes in to *femmethoughts* and just goes to town posting hateful diatribes and threats and makes a huge ass of him/her/itself then bingo! You should have a method of warning and banning the user.

It's also possible a user would have come to your sub and not agreed with the others there and opened a dialog where everyone can talk or learn something. (Or come away shaking their heads wondering how some other people can hold such and such an opinion.) But at least there was the opportunity.

The difference is that you have given everyone a chance to be a part of your community and contribute or engage in dialogue. *Even* if someone comes in with a viewpoint that you might find less than stellar on a personal level. 

There is a line, often different for us all, between what constitutes a disagreement and what is just trolling, or ""well, you said your piece, but I don't think femmethoughts is a sub for you.""

I think some Mods think they're being ""proactive"" and autobanning people they feel are potential troublemakers. But I would argue this is an internet form of a sort of profiling.

And then there are totally unrelated Subreddits. Users should not have to wonder if they'll be punished in one sub if they happen to be seen in another unrelated sub.

When you censor a story you make the rest of the community suspicious and frustrated and eventually you activate the contrarian in them and practically drive them to support the agenda of that story.

Two of the other three points you make are pretty much a consequence of that. Freedom of speech doesn't really work if you allow some people to use it to silence others.

When people bitch and moan about being banned from some subreddit, you need to realize that it's not on them to allow you into some place to begin with. ""this is a free country!"" doesn't apply here. You do not have a right to inclusion, like you think you do. Unless that subreddit is spewing forth its members to invade other subreddits, there isn't a problem here and this idea that a mod has to fix this is dumb. 

how it works is this: in the beginning there were few subs, and people just had to put up with everyone else. Then, as people made more and more subs, the main subs got away with ""this doesn't belong in this sub, go post it in this obscure tiny sub where nobody will ever see it!"" so what's left is a bunch of isolated subs, one main sub that's just full of fucking trash and reposts, and reddit has become shittier for it.

Only submitting on, or voting on, one particular person, domain, or brand's content will get an account banned from reddit - it's called vote cheating and manipulation.

I don't vote manipulate

>You should not ask for votes on reddit, even on your twitter or blog or forum - it will get your account banned, and in extreme cases can get your domain banned.

I don't do that either.

>You should join subreddits that are relevant to your interests. Give feedback to others, talk about issues that interest you, and be a good member of the community. redditors don't care that you have something to promote, they care what you think and that you have interesting things to say.

The story is about how breitbart wrote a story about worldnews censoring the story about a girl. Worldnews didn't want a link posted that criticized the sub involving censorship. So they deleted the post and automatically delete any post by that website now after that wrote the story of their censorship.

Prior to that issue I had written a letter it me being given a seven day ban many months ago. Because I posted a link from a website. The link was from CNN, and the story was NOT opinion. It was about refugees entering Europe and Germany. All posts about the topic had been deleted going back 15 hours. Someone may have felt that people were getting heated up as the topic was causing a lot of debates within many subs during this past summer. So worldnews began deleting posts one night on every post involving refugees. I was banned just for making a post. The mod who replied to my question when I asked why I was banned, told me that it was for posting an opinion piece so I was banned for seven days. I replied back saying its a genuine news website, CNN, and the article was from a corespondent and was NOT opinion. The mod did not reply back. That was many months ago and I am still banned even though it was supposed to last only seven days. This type of behaviour is why people create several accounts and using VPN an proxies. Reddit doesn't mind because then people create more accounts than they need but it boosts their numbers of user accounts and helps them provide larger stats for their advertisers.

Like this is ever possible for any rule anywhere.  You're basically saying ""find me a unicorn. Can't?  See I'm right"".  Why is it a requirement that rules for discussion be written out in black and white?  Why would reddit seek to make that a requirement when it's completely impossible?  Why is that a goal?  It's impossible in any context to do that.

The idea solution is let ""the market"" decide.  Let people go where they think the mods are doing a good job, and leave when they aren't.  That's what happens now.  Them deciding that demanding every single rule be laid out in excruciating detail by volunteer mods is stupid isn't ""putting their fingers in their ears"", it's them being realistic about how people interact, and the fact that you'll never have **any** mods if you require that, and from every single example ever on reddit, little moderation leads to garbage.

Hi spez, I'm glad you're back. I've got a related opinion from the other side of this issue.  (by the way, I was the guy who originally suggested the controversial tab in that thread about /u/linuxer so long ago).  I think the subscribers and contributors to large subs should get a say in how it is moderated. I understand that if a user creates their own sub they should be king of that sub free to rule it as capriciously or vindictively as they want.  But when subs become significantly large or are a default the moderation should be held to a higher ethical standard. I would like to see slashdot style meta moderation by contributors and mandatory public moderation logs for default and large subreddits. Maybe even moderator elections or impeachment. I constantly see posts removed for ambiguous reasons or via selective enforcement of the rules.  When it happens to you repeatedly it can feel very Orwellian and frustrating.   It especially sucks when this happens in large default subreddits and you are mocked or muted when you ask about it.   

As a user I would like an option to be able to see and participate in deleted threads and comments. I don't need to be protected from text and it should be up to me and not the mods if I want to see it. I understand that legally you are required to remove some things, but beyond that I should have the option of seeing everything. similarly,  Reddit is successful precisely because it is democratic, The more heavily moderated it is the worse this place becomes. I honestly think that down votes should be enough for hiding anything that isn't straight up illegal. I would really prefer if mods were more or less spam custodians as opposed to gatekeepers.  If subscribers are voting something up,  I think it's wrong for moderators to remove it. 

I miss the days when this place was just science and programming. The level of discourse was much higher and people had more respect for reddiquete.  I know what I've asked for could be months of work but please consider it.  I'd even consider implementing some of these plugins myself for shits and giggles.

I was permabanned for essentially saying ""maybe Graham Hancock is right"" in a submission about revision of early farming in the region around present day Israel. 

The mod wouldn't even discuss it and kept telling me rudely not to message then again. (this was before mute or they would have surely done that first). 

I'm an 8 year user and subscriber to and participant in history for years and years now and yet I'm permabanned because some nebulous interpretation of conspiracy theory and mod discretion mixed with whatever bad mood the mod was in that day? I'm not a troll, racist, nazis, Holocaust denier.

All I said was maybe a theory was correct in a discussion about an archeological discovery. 

Read what DavidReiss666 says about the mod in question. ""I stand by whatever that mod does because I know they are a good mod"". Notice he never addresses the content of what I'm asking about:

https://np.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/42neab/a_permanent_mod_mail_mute_is_needed/czdkwte

Mod discretion has become ""whatever we don't like"" and it immediately devolves to the most extreme examples as a rebuttal to moderate questions. 

>For example you delete all comments that doubt the existence of 'white privilege' or talk about other possible causes of socioeconomic data.

Science that isn't along acceptable topics is wrongthink and will be therefore removed under ""mod discretion"" 

>You also ban people who point out that these comments are removed.

>You refuse to say you are doing it, and refuse to say in your rules that you define white privilige as a scientific fact. 

This is perhaps a tenuous topic because of the ease with which mods will dismiss such topics as bigotry and racism or even nazism. 

It's the mod equivalent of national security and protecting the children. 

Whenever discussion of problematic topics comes up stereotypes are thrown around like pejoratives. 

>You claim that it falls under the rule which says people who deny the existence of gravity will be removed. However there is absolutely no scientific consensus on this (unlike gravity), as evidenced by the fact that the majority of people tend to be in uproar, gettting muted deleted and banned.

How many people who mod /r/science are scientists and how many mods of /r/History are historians?

It is a way of analyzing a situation that reveals difference in access to/control over power, money, and voice. Race can be an important variable in an analysis like that. Say, for example, you were looking at economic opportunities during South African apartheid the large scale systemic inequalities along racial or ethnic lines would be very relevant. So ""white privilege"" (meaning whites don't face conscious and unconscious bias and barriers to do with their racial category) would be an appropriate lens to use. 

White privilege isn't  discussed like a scientific fact because that doesn't make sense for a toolbox or lens of analysis. The question that any author should be answering in their lit review is whether white privilege is relevant and an appropriate tool for analyzing the data they are discussing. Readers who engage the data and lit review and want to discuss whether white privilege is useful, relevant, or appropriate are fine. From my own perspective, I often critique it for being too flat and scholars often fail to flesh it out with other intersecting variables and lenses. 

However, if someone rants, ""White privilege isn't a fact!!!!11"" it suggests they don't even understand what they are discussing. If they are trying to argue that it is always an erroneous lens of analysis then they are arguing during New World slavery, Jim Crow, colonialism, and Apartheid white people weren't systematically given affordances and non-whites denied equal access to many arenas of power, politics, and so forth.

I see where your points come from, but they seem to be coming from someone who hasn't really been around on reddit too long or been a member of other/previous websites, especially before reddit was any popular. You seem to pride yourself that ""Nope things are just bad now sorry but nothing we can do about it"".

It *is* the point of a website to be used. *Especially* when the moderators are not the owners of the website. Again, I want to repeat that.

 Moderators do not own the website. By and large, most of them are not the people who even created a given subreddit. Even more and more you see moderators who will ""Moderate"" 5 or 10 really large sub because thats what they are. Some career moderator who does it just through ""popularity"" and effort because they don't have a job in real life and nothing else to give them purpose. 

So yes. If you get banned for a sub for yelling that you hate niggers then no fucking shit, and I'm not saying the website should just be run on an anarchy system, its too big for it and frankly some people get their feelings hurt by stuff they read. Fair enough. But banning content from a sub like /r/WorldNews because it supports Syria and the mods don't or having content removed from /r/Politics because it opposes Bernie Sanders with some shitty ""Irrelevant and speculative content"" or something explanation is blood boilingly stupid. 

Mods *are not* the owners of a subreddit. No one is paying them, and to say they ""made anything there"" comes down to if they set up some decorations. They're the janitors. They should clean up the shit that some users left behind and stick to that. It does no one any good to say ""No sorry thats just how reddit is if you don't like it move to another site"" because *no one benefits from it*. People in the ""cool"" side of every sub only hear pats on the back and praise because wow surprise everyone here likes the same Presidential Candidate and hes all over the sub for some reason, what a coincidence! And those who say, don't, are banned, their opinions removed with somewhat humiliating messages telling them theres nothing they can do about it. And they just have to watch it all happen.

And that doesn't even begin to get into mods who are just lazy and incompetent. ELI5 has a shitty robot do 80% of their work. And it sucks ass, let me tell you. You can try and ask questions and it will straight get removed because you used the word ""My"". **I'm not kidding**. So this would be okay. Yunno? Hey, no ones perfect, I'll let them know and they'll let the post go through and maybe fix up their bot if they're really troopers. You know what happens when I send a very polite message over explaining the situation?

""When the bot bans something, it should be banned.""

""YOU HAVE BEEN MUTED FROM CONTACTING THE ELI5 MODS FOR 72 HOURS.""

So theres literally no reason to keep over and take it in the ass. ELI5 used to be, pretty alright imo. And now its bad, and more and more subs are just becoming that same thing *and people notice*. You didn't get subs like /r/SubredditCancer 2,3 years ago. But now that reddit is larger you get mods who think they're kings and queens instead of volunteer janitors. Unfortunately the latter got more respect.

So thats my rant. Take it for what you will. If I sound mad, I promise I'm really not. Its just easier to write it in that tone I suppose. And I've written out similar so many times that a lot of it is just from memory. Though it is frustrating sometimes. Have a good one though.",False,False,False,42571,3028,1438641800.0,False,True

Ideally this would be something outside of a mod's control. /r/me_irl/complaints or /issues could be reserved for users with a +10 net submission score & +10 net comment score in the sub, and only be subject to Reddit's sitewide rules. Maybe misusing it (hate speech or other violations of the sitewide rules) could lead to a permaban, and maybe the net score before you can post has to be tweaked. 

This idea is a compromise between ""users should be able to post what they want"" and ""a head mod has full control over their sub"". There could be some site-level link from a sub to its complaints department (like in the sidebar somewhere), and tampering with that could be made against Reddit rules. Other than that, the complaint content could be invisible to users. They'd have to seek it out.

As a mod, I try to proactively encourage dissent. We get dissent in /r/rct very rarely, but it's actually allowed in our rules -- users can post directly to the sub or message the mods. We also try to get feedback from them about the sub, but the typical [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) means we rarely get responses. I don't know if this is a realistic rule to keep when your sub has millions of subscribers, but it works for us so far. That's why I think some kind of semi-in-sub but not quite system would work best. It would negate mod complaints about cluttering up the sub, yet still keep their power somewhat in check.

You can give the warning, thus yes, engaging them, but also establishing that it's the end. Then you stop, *but you've made it clear the discussion is done.* If you haven't made it clear the discussion is done, they're not doing anything they're not supposed to. **You need to tell them, or it's not reasonable to expect them to stop.** Simple reason for why you need to tell them.

That IS engaging them, and yes it's natural human reaction that many people will want to say one more thing. That's not an unreasonable thing. At that point you should not be continuing to engage. If they're sending multiple messages after that, then admins have always done something about it for me.

You should do BOTH. They aren't mutually exclusive, and I don't think it's a mixed message. It's not unreasonable to expect you to have to tell someone the conversation is over before banning them for continuing to talk. Obviously telling them to stop is required. It's not unreasonable for someone to want to say something back, but that's not harassment or unreasonable either. 

Yea, I get it, you're saying that telling them to stop is engaging them according to admins. I'm telling you, *yes,* **and that makes sense.** I'm explaining to you how you can tell them to stop AND not be engaging them if they continue. I'm explaining why you need to tell them to stop, and why they don't get banned for a response once after you told them to stop.

You don't keep saying ""this conversation is over."" That's engaging again. You do it ONCE.

I ran into EXACTLY the problem you had, and this solution worked just fine. 

TLDR: Yes, you need to tell them to stop before they'll get banned for not stopping. That just makes sense.

And no, we're not. Firstly, it makes zero sense that we would not just buy more servers if that was the answer. It personally pains me whenever we have site issues, and beyond that it hurts the business when the site is not available for people. If the answer was ""just spend more money to keep the site up"", why would we not do that?

To more directly address your suppositions, it's not always memcache dying, it can be any great number of things that have to go right for your request to be answered in a correct and prompt manner. Postgres, Cassandra, HAproxy, Zookeeper, a number of systems all have to work perfectly. Given our current design, if we have issues with any one of those the whole site will start to have issues. It's also not memcache's fault (99.99% of the time), it's the fact that we are relying on the network and remote systems to be operational and perfect 100% of the time for thousands of requests every second. That's just not a real thing you can assume when working with distributed complex systems, and we're working to address that.

There was the group that was screaming about censorship on the first page because vote totals decayed and their prized post wasn't the top of /r/about lol anymore. So the admins changed the algorithm so points wouldn't decay as fast. And then another group started bitching about how stagnant the front page was because the point totals weren't decaying fast enough. 

The second group actually had a valid complaint so the admins reverted their changes back to the original algorithm. But that algorithm is still flawed because it was never meant to handle the scale and shape reddit grew to. And the admins said exactly that when they reverted the changes. 

One of the big problems is that a person's front page is made up of the top posts of all of their subscribed subreddits. And every subreddit is a different size. AskReddit is fucking massive, 10 million subscribers or something and the top post there always has several thousand votes. But something like /r/PeanutButter only as a couple hundred subscribers and rarely has new content. Yet reddit's algorithm needs to handle sorting both of these subs the exact same way. But then you also have weird ass subreddits like IAMA where there are a lot of subs, but only the top post gets votes. And that post will have thousands of points and the next biggest will be lucky to get more than a couple dozen. So the top post there will take up the front page slot for IAMA for over a day. 

How do you write a single algorithm that can handle sorting AskReddit, PeanutButter, and IAMA into a single front page that constantly has new content, but doesn't bury posts prematurely?",False,False,False,509929,681,1363043697.0,False,True

First off, the former mod who reported all of this stuff was a nut, to put it bluntly. He regularly mocked and insulted regular members of the sub whenever they disagreed with him. He was paranoid and convinced anyone talking positively about the game was a shill, so he (I'm not joking here) started gathering a list of users and their IPs in an attempt to prove it. When this was discovered, he was swiftly and rightfully banned. He then used the subreddit bot account (which the other mods forgot to ban) to throw a temper tantrum and destroy the CSS of the subreddit.

Anyway, the actual ""bribing"" consisted of the community manager asking the mods to delete alpha footage, which was under NDA. They originally agreed, but reversed their decision literally a day later. Meaning alpha footage and discussion were allowed throughout 99% of the alpha.

I think the most laughable quote from that VG Chartz article is:

This is a certain kind of entertainment that you can really only appreciate once you start dipping your toes into metareddit.

What becomes more interesting, however, are the redditors themselves.

It's disturbing and fascinating to see the horrible opinions of otherwise normal people and sometimes hilarious to read the lengths these people will go to in order to avoid confronting their own bigotries.  SRS doesn't have an end goal for reddit, as none of us have any illusions of ""saving"" reddit.  Reddit can't be saved.

As much as the voter base appreciated George Bush Jr's presidency

The topic was archeology which changes all the time and is one of the most fluid disciplines.

Either way, someone is attacking someone else, in a very personal way, for something that they don't agree with.

It only took a few sentences for the pejoratives to start. How difficult was it trying to sound reasonable and moderate for the first few? 

How is it acceptable to dismiss anyone as ""teenage boys""? 

Death threats are against the law. Surely they were reported to authorities, right? 

Or were they met with the same response that always occurs? Police investigated and found no credible threat. 

For all of the social media and Twitter users saying they receive death or rape threats the evidence of such is suspiciously absent. Otherwise you'd hear about arrests frequently considering how many claims are made.

They already have a 3-4 default mod rule, why would 10-20 of the regular subs be impossible?

OK, maybe only certain aspects of mod logs are public, but I still lean towards erring on the side of as much info as possible. 

Spammers are going to spam regardless. 

The issue today is that people are alleging that non spammers and trolls are being treated with contempt and that even moderates who clash with mod agenda are being impacted more and more. 

>I get that you want to increase accountability, but without consequences it's hard to see how public logs would result in any practical change for users.

Which is powerful, but there aren't any tools to help users discover that for themselves. They'd have to visit a peripheral subreddit that tracks it. Otherwise despotic mods merely delete, hide, ban, mute and sticky whatever they want to steer the narrative. 

Mods are like the main stream media of reddit. Yes there are alternatives but you can't always tell how much you're being lied to. 

A lot of the people who have risen as moderation consolidators are basically politicians and are experts in double speak. 

If you talk to DR666 everything is racists, nazis and Holocaust deniers for why he does what he does.

Maybe I was completely blind back then, or maybe they were just better at the time... But I remember /r/srs being a subreddit where people would link a comment of someone being a genuine ass. Not a grey area or joke comment or anything. Just pure bullying and such. Basically, SRS used to link comments and threads that were guilty of doing the very things they take pride in doing, that everyone hates them for.

But then it became nasty. I'd voice my opinion about something, trying to take the diplomatic route. But the downvotes would pour in. That is, until I straight up said they weren't being fair and got banned for it. But this was after leaving for a couple months since the toxicity there was having a very bad effect one me. Got unbanned at one point, then banned again because I got featured in SRS.

In the time that I was there though, there would be comments that would actually say things like ""downvote this fucker"" or people clearly from SRS (announcing it or otherwise) would then rush to downvote and comment on whatever they were doing. Even when I was part of the subreddit, I never went to downvote or interact with linked comments. I just observed, then discussed it in the SRS threads.

They took more and more pride in doing things like that. There was a point where they actually changed their subreddit style to have their posts and comments featured as ""negative karma"" without allowing for downvotes. It's meant to be a reference to how they would ""invade"" threads and the comments linked to SRS, and how they wore their negative karma in those threads with pride. It's also meant to reference what that sub became: An excuse to just downvote brigade.

The fact that SRS was never dealt with kind of makes me understand why people have those conspiracy theories about how the higher ups are in on it, and are doing the same thing that the mods of SRS and other subreddits are doing: Picking and choosing what ""bad behavior"" they'll take care of, and removing things that they don't *like* whether those things are a problem or not.",False,False,False,89716,621,1329096034.0,False,True

You're never going to get ANYWHERE with anyone who actually has the power to change things if you keep arguing from a position that is just plain not true.

What somebody says is hardly the last word. The fact is that Reddit at both the macro and micro level is really about the users. Without users, both a subreddit as well as it Reddit itself is like an empty arena. 

Not to mention, mods do not actually **own** their subs. They are granted authority over them only because the admins let/need them. The mods may be unaccountable to the users, but the admins have the real power. A mod is basically just the operator of a fast food franchise. As the above poster said, if you want total control over your own little online sandbox, start a blog. And even then the same natural law applies - without users, your site is lame.

> Yea, mod abuse is a problem. Mod impeachment doesn't fix it, taking over other people's creations isn't a fix either.

Unless you're suggesting the mods create most of the content, calling a subreddit a moderator's creation is facetious. That's like saying an entire economy is the creation of utility workers.

> If YOU want some open thing, then YOU can go create another site. YOU are the one going against how reddit is design. YOU are the one demanding it change, literally as you tell someone to go start a blog if they want something 'different'. Voat exists for exactly that reason.

This is like a business owner saying ""you don't like my crappy product, go buy from someone else!"". In principle this is true, but that's a gross oversimplification. A business owner can tell all his clients/customers/users to go sit and spin, and even if he doesn't have competition, the market if pushed too far can just leave them to rot, and once it happens, it's almost impossible to correct. A free market does not liberate sellers from the need for buyers. 

A large subreddit is like a franchise mixed with a public corporation. Once you cross a certain threshold and become *de facto* dependent upon outside contributions, you stop becoming the sole authority over your common asset. Suggesting that the moderators of default subs don't have to be accountable to the userbase is like saying a company board can tell the shareholders to sit and spin - that's simply not how the Force works, in theory or in practice.

Nope. What I'm trying to express is subtle, and I'm obviously failing miserably in communicating it to you. 

I'm essentially saying that the amount of emphasis people on SRS put on the karma system to discern the type of people on Reddit (and hence, why it deserves to be brigaded and some of its users harassed) is foolish. 

For example, if they want to prove that Reddit is full of racists, they might point to the upvoting of an article concerning Sweden's decision to ""expel"" 60,000 migrants next year. While no doubt some racists upvoted the title, if they actually took the time to read the article and discover that the real figure will come nowhere near that, they likely wouldn't have upvoted it at all due to the disappointment. The people who did read it and are presumably not racists, would have upvoted it just because it's a story of interest for Europe. 

Do you see what I'm trying to get at? It's that there are multiple reasons why something gets upvoted or buried (few of which are great indicators of the users' character) that makes the SRS community pointless in basing their supposed dislike of the site on the karma system, even as a joke/troll.

Maybe.  This could just be a perception though. Everyone has different standards of who is a ""decent"" person, so a strict interpretation could cause someone to believe that they are surrounded by racists.

A joke. Most agree she did a good job and should not have been fired based on her AMA performance.

1. Their tendency to use the linked comments/threads and post in them, bullying/flaming/trolling/whatever in there. They were consistently downvoted heavily for it, and so there were multiple threads in SRS that showed that the community at the time felt like that was a badge of honor. Essentially, upvotes and downvotes in external subreddits were treated the same.

2. Their tendency to mass downvote users who post the threads or comments linked in SRS. It was alluded to a lot back when I mostly read the subreddit. Links to specific users were common, ""piece of shit"" was used to describe people multiple times. References to the downvotes the user(s) had received and encouragement to ""keep it up"" with the downvoting and abusive comments.

It's the entire architecture of the subreddit system.

A subreddit belongs wholly to the user that created it. That user may, if they chose, allow the public to visit the subreddit (or set it to private). They may invite users to become moderators and give them various permissions. They may allow the public to submit links. 

It seems like you want to fundamentally remake the basic structure of the subreddit system all together so that one user does not have ultimate power. 

A noble goal, but let's not pretend there is a band-aid here. We're talking about fundamentally changing the core of the site.

Let's also remember that a democratic system on the internet is a giant bullseye for griefing and abuse.

I think a core thing that needs to be addressed is defaults. I don't like them. They consolidate too much into them. This creates problems for mods and users.

Users don't want to have to submit to smaller or obscure subs. Users sometimes won't know they exist. 

For mods, being a default makes the sub a target. It becomes a massive platform for agendas. People are *constantly* trying to use TIL to push their agenda simply because they can put ""TIL"" in front of it and try to hit a massive audience. People regularly argue that they're entitled to do that, despite that it is against the purpose of the sub (yes, we DO still have the creator, the guy who grew it.). They feel entitled because ""well what other default should we put it in??!?!?!"" I don't know, and I don't care. It's not TIL's job to be the fuckin catchall just because someone can't find a different default to push their agenda in, but we still CONSTANTLY take shit for it from people with agendas.

So I think they need to cut down on defaults being such big ass monoliths that become targets for abuse.

most of the manosphere stuff is the same a men's rights. like,  I'm not getting my info 'from srs',  I'm getting it from years of watching mensrights and avfm and all that stuff and just constantly being disappointed with how many men they exclude.  I genuinely don't care enough to go hunting for a citation so like whatever this isn't a ""strong debate point"" lmao I just wanna make that clear. 

meanwhile honestly to ME you look like you're getting all your info from mensrights itself. like of course you're not gonna see any of that shit it you're looking at it from a ""wow it's so great to see people supporting men"" perspective.  

and a preemptive defense of me saying that despite being a feminist: feminism has hella issues.  ESPECIALLY re transphobia racism ableism though luckily I feel like the homophobia, while definitely not nonexistent, is pretty mild..... but feminists as a whole are working on that and policing each other when we get out of line and trying to emphasize how important True Equality for EVERY ONE is, rather than just 'equality for me!! :)' type stuff. a lot of feminist celebs (Lena Dunham Tina fey Amy Schumer and the like) are pretty universally hated in most of my feminist circles because of their racism and other bigoted jokes in the name of feminism...  

so like if even feminism is having to work on these issues that are pretty much exclusively associated with us, then how is it at all realistic to say that mensrights doesn't?? I've NEVER seen mra's police themselves and others in their groups to keep out even some of the most blatant bigotry. again I've been watching this ever since I first started thinking about feminism vs """"""egalitarianism"""""" like five years ago. meanwhile menslib seems to regularly discuss ways to like, support such-and-such group of men without denying the needs of such-and-such group and other supportive shit like that.  

like you're writing of menslib pretty quick just based on it being feminist. if you spend some time there you might realize how big of a contrast it is from the manosphere in terms of supporting men rather than hating women. 

but yeah don't feel like you have to reply to this.  we can just go our separate ways here.

First of all, I think this only should be considered for huge subs and default subs. If the vast majority of subscribers and contributors disagree with moderator actions then boot them the hell out. 

At the moment there is zero recourse for mods who blatantly censor things they don't like, interpret the rules selectively and push agendas themselves. There are plenty of cancerous mods harming their own communities who are  reviled by their users. 

>What about when people do things like upvote something that breaks the rules because they like to hear it? How about when people get riled up over legit removals? How are you going to handle those witch hunts? 

let them be optionally visible. if people disagree with the moderation on that post  they can report it. if it happens regularly enough it should trigger a vote to depose the mod. 

>What are you going to do about the selection bias and general MOUNTAIN of perception biases for seeing ""selective enforcement""?

Rules should be clear, and If friggen everyone in the sub agrees that a mod is pulling this bullshit regularly then they shouldn't be there period.  What can we do about biased mods? we can downvote shitty content we can't do anything to shitty mods. 

>What about when there's some big happening, and people try to submit it to EVERY sub, like they always do, and people get pissy at sub B, where it was removed because it broke the rules, simply because it was ALSO removed from Sub A, and claim it must be conspiracy, and actively ignore that sometimes things just broke the fuckin rules? that's not a hypothetical. It's happened, more than once.

if it's OPTIONALLY VISIBLE i don't see a problem with that. you select the option to view removed posts and you see that it's been reposted 50 times what's wrong with that exactly?

>How about people like POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS, who were actively dedicated to stirring up drama for the sake of it (see also: game of trolls)? You ever see some of his work? 

If it's optionally visible What's the harm in it?

>Yes, selective enforcement and vindictive behavior are a problem (although not NEARLY as much as some people think because they operate under the incorrect assumption that they have a right to the community in the first place), but allowing for mod witch hunts doesn't fix that.

The racists feel the same way about SRS I imagine.  I just feel that forming angry mobs to harass people only furthers the ""us"" vs. ""them"" mentality.  It gives the other group justification to form a hate mob to come after you.

Here are posts that went up after being linked to SRS.  And I have more of them than you, so I win.  

Seriously though, you assume that SRS is responsible for all downvotes.  Sometimes posts can get downvoted organically.  Sometimes it isn't always the boogie~~man~~woman.  

And then for the next SRSsucks link that people always go to, here's a rebuttal for that:  

> 1) ""Evidence"" of brigading where users who posted comments saying some reprehensible things, like claiming corporate hacking is worse than rape, ended up in net downvotes. There is such a thing as SRS and average redditors agreeing that a comment is dumb/terrible.
> 
> 2) SRD thread about a user being shadowbanned, the context being something about Gawker linking to Tumblr page that doxed some users. No mention of SRS.
> 
> 3) Linked thread is about an /r/antiSRS mod being doxed, no mention of SRS. The guy being doxed said that the phone calls he received sounded like teenage boys you'd hear on Xbox Live. Could've been SRS, could've been 4chan.
> 
> 4) From the linked thread: ""Note, it was Adrien Chen of Gawker media who doxxed ViolentAcrez. It was not SRS.""
> 
> 5) I don't have the time to go through a month of IRC chat logs. From what I scanned, there were two instances of SRS users asking for upvotes: one in an SRS thread that was being brigaded by /r/mensrights, and one for a videogame competition charity thread. No doxing. In fact, one of the users in that chat log was pointing out that a /r/mensrights user was trying to dox a woman.
> 
> 6) Jesus, another IRC log? Since the person who put together this list didn't post any evidence of brigading or doxing for this, I'm assuming they didn't actually look through the log for any evidence.

I stopped bothering to go through the list because more than half of the links don't support the claims being made, so there's not much reason to believe the rest will either. The post only appears legitimate because a giant wall of text appeals to the ""\[Citation Needed\]"" mindset of redditors. And even after going through and debunking a majority of them, someone can still claim that I didn't do my due diligence by debunking *every single link*. If this list were created in good faith, the author would have included actual quotes and explanations, not just links to entire months' worth of IRC logs or gigantic pictures of stitched together screenshots.

Are you really saying that if you see someone doing something wrong in subreddit X, you only ban them from subreddit X? I must be misinterpreting you, but I can't see how.

[Full disclosure: You're mod in 155 subreddits.]

And this (and the 9/11 denier removal) was the very reason I had started that discussion with you (EDIT: after which you ultimately removed me as mod from /r/java). I didn't find that action to be right in /r/java because those people had not done such a thing there.

Can you clarify why my two quotes of you are not a contradiction?

In case they *are* indeed a contradiction: Why would you be lying when you so clearly say that you have the truth on your side and that others who think differently are afraid of the truth?

It's not just worthless, it detracts from my ability to engage with the actual discourse which is being drowned out.

I experienced plenty of bad behaviour from biased mods who know they can't be held accountable. That is very frustrating. 

I understand before I start that even if I wrote a perfect system it would have little chance of making it into reddit. If it did make it it would only be on a very small scale for new subreddits or extra large ones.  BUT there's a good chance of voat taking the code because their vision aligns more with mine, chances are I'm on my own and that's OK.  I don't even mind if voat doesn't take it. I'll start my own darn site. 

My biggest gripe with reddit is it's not seen as a free speech platform by the admins or by the mods or by the users.  There is no real free speech social media platform out there, except maybe vote.co.  I've been wanting to do something like this for a long time. Diving into this code is fun in and of itself. I love python and they have an excellent script for building the site and getting everything up and running. 

I prefer to get a quick prototype into a test site and iterate there until everyone is confident that it works properly.  I'm in the middle of getting it installed as we speak. 

 It's nice to have every single detail worked out before a single line of code is written but in my 10 years of web dev consulting experience there are always always always unanticipated aspects that will sully the best laid plans.  I'm not saying that means ""don't make plans at all"".  It's more about getting a basic prototype of the idea in place on a test site then tweaking it until it is as good as it will get.   Maybe then I'll submit the pull request.

Yes, I do. Women who *want* to be part of these fields are excluded, by either legal or societal reasons and that's *not okay*. Women who work construction are constantly assumed to be incompetent. Women who want to be front line soldiers aren't legally allowed to in a lot of places. That isn't right.

Women aren't a minority in STEM of their own accord. Studies show that they're often subtly discouraged by professors and get promoted less often. If identical resumes have a male name and a female name on them, the female name gets hired less often and is perceived as underqualified. There are incentives working to change it, but societal stigmas telling women they're not good at math and science from the time they're small children is not the same at them choosing not to go into science in a vacuum.

If users can start seeing everything, they will continually harass that on every single comment we delete. We already got tons of messages about deleting jokes and other off-topic things, now if we did that it would just be even worse. You then get into issues of showing who deleted a comment. Was it a mod? Was it the automod? Will that mod start getting PMs and targeted for performing mod actions? It just gets into a really nasty situation really fast that ultimately does nothing to make the quality of the content any better. The sub is still the same, and it doesn't improve the subreddit at all.


There wouldn't be nearly as much hatemail if there was a way for subscribers to hold mods accountable by downvoting poor moderation. The mod could be anonymous to the users but tick marks against them would still count without uniquely identifying them.  Then people who opt in to see the removed content could vote up or down the modding decision. If a mod is always deep in the negatives for every post removal then it shows that the community doesn't appreciate the way this person is policing it. Then it could trigger a subbreddit wide vote to see if they keep the mod on a page showing their mod log for the last year. 

If you absolutely refuse to have any recourse for people who disagree with your decisions and refuse to have any real accountability for your actions then dealing with their anger goes with the territory of being a mod. I think it goes without saying that If you can't handle people being angry at you for removing their posts then you're not cut out to be a mod.  And if everyone gets mad at the stuff that is being removed and you receive a TON of hate mail then that indicates you are doing a real shitty job of being a moderator.

While I get that it's important to make people feel safe on this website, they should feel safe over their general wellbeing.  Not that their opinions should not be questioned - even by someone who does not hold a majority opinion - one that is easily seen as hateful.  For two reasons.

One - This lets you be more sure about your opinion.  You learn nothing in an echo chamber.  Why shouldn't arabs be deported?  Why do you have this opinion?  Defending your opinion rather than just having it helps you have a firmer stance on your opinions.

>Hi /u/Spez, can you comment on the criticism that Suspensions/Muting and the new tools have actually caused an increase in the animosity between users and moderators? In /r/science, this is a constant problem that we deal with.

>Muting users has done essentially the same thing as banning them has - it ultimately tells them their behavior is unacceptable, and encourages them to reach out in modmail to discuss the situation with us further. 90% of the time, this results in them sending hateful messages to use that are full of abuse. We are then told to mute them in modmail, and they are back in 72 hours to abuse us some more. We have gone to the community team to report these users, and are told completely mixed answers. In some cases, we are told that by merely messaging the user to stop abusing us in modmail, we are engaging them and thus nothing can be done. In other cases, we are told that since we didn't tell them to stop messaging us, nothing can be done.

>You say that you want to improve moderator relations, but these new policies have only resulted in us fielding more abuse. It has gotten so bad in /r/science, that we have resorted to just banning users with automod and not having the automated reddit system send them any more messages, as the level of venomous comments in modmail has gotten too high to deal with. We have even recently had moderators receive death threats over such activities. This is the exact opposite scenario that you would wish to happen, but the policies on moderator abuse are so lax that we have had to take actions into our own hands.

Some subs have started using the NSFW tagging to hide spoiler thumbnails, but that also has flaws, because it still gets filtered as NSFW, doesn't hide the title, and can't be marked as both NSFW and spoilers (other than manually through the post title).

But then again I have been dismissed by mods in a different bandwidth related topic who tell me ""it's not reddit's responsibility to look out for your bandwidth"", well sure I get that, but once I run out of bandwidth, I won't be clicking links or viewing ads any longer, you'd think someone who relies on clicks and ad views would want to save as much bandwidth for the user as possible. I dunno, seems kind of logical to me.

I guess it's not your responsibility to try to save their bandwidth either. If you ask me that's a super fucked up attitude for the mods to take! I hope opinions in admin land aren't as uncaring and dismissive as the mods are about it and that the folks over in mod land change their attitude about it soon.

I've been advocating for this for years, I really don't see what's taking them so long. There is no *good* implementation right now.

Even if we pretend that all users are on reddit.com with subreddit styles enabled, inboxed replies show spoilers as **highlighted text** (blue, as a link!), drawing the eye to the spoiler. Or, if we use the `[](/s ""Spoiler here"")` system, it either doesn't show up (when they leave the `[]` blank) or the user has to somehow figure out that they need to hover over the link for it to show the spoiler text.

Then there are people who disable subreddit themes, breaking it in the actual subs, and the people who use apps that either don't support spoiler text or don't support all of the different varieties in use.

Better late than never, right?

Another *wonderful* thing that Reddit made sure to do on that change? 

Anyone who purchase AlienBlue'a Pro version (which adds features and removed all ads) are being given 4 years of Reddit gold - giftable or claimable (I took it for this account).  Likely they did this because they will be moving to a renewable model that will provide the AlienBlue Pro features and total ad removal from AB's one-time purchase model  to the previously mentioned renewable Reddit Gold model. Expect something similar to the main page after the app goes through the changes.   

I haven't heard any more timeframes from anyone official other than the original announcement which claimed about 3-4 weeks lag time. That would put it at this week.

Anyone who purchase AlienBlue'a Pro version (which adds features and removed all ads) are being given 4 years of Reddit gold - giftable or claimable (I took it for this account).  Likely they did this because they will be moving to a renewable model that will provide the AlienBlue Pro features and total ad removal from AB's one-time purchase model  to the previously mentioned renewable Reddit Gold model. I'd bet they will roll out something similar to their main page around the same time they do that for their app.   

Even beta testers of AB who were given pro for free will get the 4 years of Reddit Gold. I have yet to have had my 4 years of gold applied AFAIK, but it should any time now.

Or like Reza Aslan says, xenophobes always forget Indonesia, for some reason - should we bomb them, too?
