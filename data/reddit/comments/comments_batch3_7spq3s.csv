After I enabled 2FA. I was able to disable it whilst being still logged into my account, but without being prompted for a 2FA code or generated backup code. I checked using Incognito mode, logging in cleanly, and I was still able to disable it without requiring a 2FA code.
So before if a co-worker/spouse/friend jumped my computer they already weren't able to change my Reddit password without me having the option of resetting it to my email, but now they can click 2 buttons to enable 2FA and I get locked out of my own account with no method of recourse to get it back. -_- This isn't a good design, especially with a ""log me out from everywhere button"". I don't want to scope creep the project, but that seems like it should be within reasonable security scope/threat model.

But I do understand the trade off, people losing their phones and such. So I would think the solution may be best left up to the user. An SMS notification perhaps, but people's number may change when they lose their phone anyway too. SMS is not secure, but anyone who knows that would be using a seperate option which would be a default unchecked checkbox which says ""I agree that I must provide a 2FA code, or a backup code, to deactivate 2FA OR THIS SETTING""?

Also, having to prompt for a 2FA code to get my backup codes would be good. So someone can't come along and have a list of 10 secret codes to use against me later down the line if they figure out my password/email account details, and at that time they wouldn't need to compromise my phone at the same time.

Pretty UI stuff:

On the Enable Two-Factor setup screen, you have to click ""Enter the key manually"" to get the image back, that text should update.

Secondly. When you login, the button to submit your 2FA code says ""Check code"", I would suggest it should just be ""Submit"". That's a blur of the lines between implementation (which is literally checking the code), and usage(which is someone using it is going to legitimately be just submitting you the code they have).

**DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL THEY HAVE WORKED OUT ALL THE BUGS.**  

Mods support across Reddit is limited, and if you mess up on authenticating, you WILL be locked out of your account.   

At least, that's been my experience with Apple's two-factor verification. I had to tell someone that their brand-new iPad Pro they just bought is now a fancy paperweight because they forgot their authentication credentials. There's no coming back from that, ~~even~~ unless if you have a receipt (this guy threw his away).   

Granted, Reddit isn't a $1300 device, but it would be extremely annoying to be locked out of  your Reddit account until an extremely overworked volunteer mod can verify your credentials, assuming mods have the admin rights to do this. That could be hours, days, hell, even weeks.   

If it's Reddit's tech support only that will have these admin rights, it could be permanent.   

And, frankly, the vast majority of people on Reddit have little to no need for this kind of security, considering that Reddit is basically just a bulletin board full of shitposts and a tiny bit of really usable information.    

It's not like they have access to your financial records.

It's bad enough that you constantly spam, over and over and over again with begging, pleading, and endless demands to use your Android app -- when I use your site on mobile.

Due to that, I use Reddit a LOT less than I would otherwise.  I essentially never use it on my phone.

Don't pester me about this on every connection to Reddit, or login.  Don't bug me about giving you my mobile phone number -- no, you'll never, ever, ever get my phone number.  Not for 2-step, or any other reason.

It's GREAT to give people the option.  Just don't force it.  Because, why would I even remotely care if my account is compromised?  I'd just make another, and move on...

EDITED...

I now see you can use an external two-factor app.  That's a nice touch, and good to see.  I still have little desire for Google or Authy to link my account info to my phone ID.  As far as I'm concerned, that's MORE invasive than my mobile app number.

Not because of Reddit linking account <-> ID, but because Google will surely link my Android phone <-> Reddit account, and likely Authy will too (via all the perms their app has).

i just think there is a lot more wrong with this site that needs fixing first, rather than implementing 2FA for something that holds little to no personal or attributable information about me IRL.

Why not just encourage people to implement a secure password (your recomentdation of 8 characters could be brute forced in anything from 22 mins to 2 hours depending on complexity. 12 characters would be a better recomendation). 2FA is beyond overkill for a site like reddit... 

Speaking as a developer myself, the only reason you would decide to implement this is if you were planning on collecting a lot more personal information like full names and more contact info, maybe storing credit cards etc, stuff people would actually worry about malicious actors gaining access to... If that is the case you need to take a look at what your actual users want otherwise you'll quickly find the number of users starts to drop off, because you are no longer offering the service that we originally came here for. If you're not careful you'll end up giving up your USP for the sake of trying to compete with the big boys of social networking.

Yeah, no thanks. 

Honestly, there is nothing to gain from hacking the average Reddit account so there is no need for 2FA. I'm willing to bet 50% or more of the active accounts on Reddit are throw away accounts, alts and abandoned accounts. 

With all of the censorship on Reddit these days being dished out by over zealous moderators and the severely lop sided politics that rules this site there really is no reason to even have an account on Reddit. What's the point? So you can share, be down voted, deleted, silenced. What made Reddit great was the open discussion and free flow of information. Today? It's nothing more than a news aggregate that wants to serve up ads and is willing to delete, ban and ignore the user base just to appease it's own political, financial  and social agenda. Anyone who doesn't already have a Reddit account is better off just being a voyeur and not engaging. The leadership at Reddit is toxic and so is a majority of it's user base.

Is no one paying attention to the way the world is going?  Pretty soon everything you type out on your keyboard will/can be open for use against you in some form or another.  I am on reddit a lot and even the most sincere person is an asshat and says silly or ignorant things occasionally.

Scenario:  Google gets hacked, emails and passwords are leaked, their authentication app is also hacked, someone puts a file out there with everyone's email/password and log in history (along with posts) of the major websites and forums for the world to see.  It's all easily searched and indexed.

It starts off with someone trying to gotcha a republican but quickly spirals out of control as average users are targeted for speech from 1500 different groups looking for people to hang.

Regarding your phone-in-toilet comment, that is not what 2FA codes are. They are a second factor of authentication whenever the site requires to reestablish your assertion of you saying who you are(typically when logging in). And to hit your second point, even trusted devices should be re-prompted every 30 days for a TOTP code again, by industry standard. The limits the window of opportunity for an already logged in compromised device.

Here is the process that LastPass goes through to remove a 2FA code.
https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=7066

They use another alternative factor of authentication when you don't have access to your TOTP 2FA, your email address. Although it's not asssssss secure as the TOTP, it's a healthier compromise then not required any additional factors to lower your account security.

There should not be a button to reduce account security which avoids confirmation through the already existing account security.

TOTP: 
Secret is created which is shared between server and user. Secret is combined with the time using a hash to generate the OTP. Server and user both generate OTP and compare. What this looks like to the user is an app generates a 6 digit number, which is presented to the server to authenticate.

Weaknesses: Secret can be exposed at time of creation, and can be accidentally exposed by either the server or user. Even if the secret is stored in some write-only fashion like on a yubikey, the app/key can be tricked into giving out OTPs that will be valid in the future by feeding the app/card a time in the future.

U2f: User generates a private-public key pair, usually in some sort of write-only fashion on a usb token (such as a yubikey) so that the private key cannot be compromised without posession of the token.

User publishes the public key with the server, and the server generates a challenge at the time of authentication to verify the user possesses the private key. What this looks like to the user is they plug in the USB token and press a button to authenticate.

Advantages: since no secret is shared, the secret (private key) cannot be exposed; challenges are generated randomly at authentication time, so they cannot be solved ahead of time like TOTP.

I think 2FA should probably not be possible without a verified e-mail address.  If someone loses their 2FA token, then the process for fixing that should be automated but very lengthy.  IE- start the process, get an email that alerts you that someone's trying to disable 2FA.  You will then get another identical email every day for a week at a random time each day, and a popup on each device logged into Reddit.  At the end of the week, the 7th email includes a link to reset 2FA.  
Point of this: if someone's phone gets stolen, the thief might have access to both their Reddit and their email.  A week is enough time to reset passwords etc.  

Some heuristics should be built into this- IE if you are doing it from the same IP as you usually log into Reddit from, it's easier; if you're doing it from another country or from another device it's harder.  

For verification options it might be useful to spread that out.  Let someone link multiple contact options (different emails, twitter, SMS, landline phone, etc) and specify to only turn off 2FA when two of those contact methods approve it.  This should be optional, NOT required- don't want to set up a 'let Reddit doxx you or you don't get security' type situation (and a lot of people WILL see it that way).

TOTP is an example of a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate a one-time password.

FreeOTP is a soft token authenticator that can be used for two-factor authentication. It provides implementations of HOTP and TOTP. Tokens can be added by scanning a QR code or by manually entering in the token configuration. FreeOTP can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator even when logging into Google services. It is maintained by Red Hat under the Apache 2.0 license.

https://gauth.apps.gbraad.nl

You need to enter in the secret key. When you initially set up TOTP on a reddit account, you get the QR code, and clicking some text displays the secret key. So you could store that secret key in some alternate account online, and in an emergency, log in to that account, use the secret key to enroll a new TOTP device (such as this website), and then log into you reddit account. You could do something similar by saving the QR code image, and enrolling a new (camera-containing) device using that QR code in an emergency. With a general purpose QR code reader you can also scan the QR code and extract the secret key from the data, it's pretty clear what the secret key is from the data.

There's also [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) which is a TOTP client for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Chrome extension. It syncs your keys to the cloud. You authenticate into your account via SMS, so it's maybe vulnerable to SMS hijacking just like other SMS 2FA. Although I think it might allow you to encrypt your backups with a password.

Lastpass [also](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/18/lastpass-authenticator-can-now-back-two-factor-data-online/) can store TOTP keys and sync them between devices. I'm pretty sure it encrypts them with a password you choose.

The Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time. It has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238, is the cornerstone of Initiative For Open Authentication (OATH), and is used in a number of two-factor authentication systems.

TOTP is an example of a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate a one-time password.

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

Or look at it this way. Start with what we'd all agree is a bad password. All lowercase, 8 characters long. That's ~2e11 possible passwords. That's well, well within what's trivial to brute force.

If it's an IP in a mobile data range, that's likely to be a single individual (rather than NAT'ed WiFi).

All they then need to do is correlate website or service sign-in (which will be bounced off their services) with either existing cookies or some other identifier (or possible even simply the timing of when it happens) and you have some added confidence to the real identity of a user (and it only takes one slip-up to forever make that link).

Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War.

No, their implication was a service placing a limit should be _considered_ insecure.

Not ""the limit makes it insecure"".

""The limit makes it so you have to assume the service is insecure.""

That advice goes around often. People give that advice because a service that places limits on password length often doesn't hash passwords (because hash functions don't have a practical input length limit).

If this is the first time you hear that advice, then I understand your confusion. But this isn't about length complexity at all.

It's about the same idiots who think password length limits are a good idea also not knowing the first thing about security.

See the top reply to that original post:

> Even then be suspicious. A max password length of any size implies they could be storing the password instead of its hash, a major security blunder.
